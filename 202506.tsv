CVE-2025-48957	2025-06-02T12:15:25.680	2025-06-25T17:39:23.137	AstrBot is a large language model chatbot and development framework. A path traversal vulnerability present in versions 3.4.4 through 3.5.12 may lead to information disclosure, such as API keys for LLM providers, account passwords, and other sensitive data. The vulnerability has been addressed in Pull Request #1676 and is included in version 3.5.13. As a workaround, users can edit the `cmd_config.json` file to disable the dashboard feature as a temporary workaround. However, it is strongly recommended to upgrade to version v3.5.13 or later to fully resolve this issue.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2025-48958	2025-06-02T12:15:25.840	2025-06-25T17:36:43.537	Froxlor is open source server administration software. Prior to version 2.2.6, an HTML Injection vulnerability in the customer account portal allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML payloads in the email section. This can lead to phishing attacks, credential theft, and reputational damage by redirecting users to malicious external websites. The vulnerability has a medium severity, as it can be exploited through user input without authentication. Version 2.2.6 fixes the issue.	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L		
CVE-2025-48990	2025-06-02T12:15:25.997	2025-06-02T17:32:17.397	NeKernal is a free and open-source operating system stack. Version 0.0.2 has a 1-byte heap overflow in `rt_copy_memory`, which unconditionally wrote a null terminator at `dst[len]`. When `len` equals the size of the destination buffer (256 bytes), that extra `'\0'` write overruns the buffer by one byte. To avoid breaking existing callers or changing the public API, the patch in commit fb7b7f658327f659c6a6da1af151cb389c2ca4ee takes a minimal approach: it simply removes the overflow-causing line without adding bounds checks or altering the function signature.

Prior to version 1.8.39, the search component does not validate permissions correctly, which allows attackers to determine the existence of hidden (draft, unapproved, or soft-deleted) threads containing specified text in the title. The visibility state (`mybb_threads.visible` integer column) of threads is not validated in internal search queries, whose result is used to output a general success or failure of the search. While MyBB validates permissions when displaying the final search results, a search operation that internally produces at least one result outputs a redirect response (as a HTTP redirect, or a success message page with delayed redirect, depending on configuration). On the other hand, a search operation that internally produces no results outputs a corresponding message in the response without a redirect. This allows a user to determine whether threads matching title search parameters exist, including draft threads (`visible` with a value of `-2`), soft-deleted threads (`visible` with a value of `-1`), and unapproved threads (`visible` with a value of `0`); in addition to displaying generally visible threads (`visible` with a value of `1`). This vulnerability does not affect other layers of permissions. In order to exploit the vulnerability, the user must have access to the search functionality, and general access to forums containing the thread(s). The vulnerability does not expose the message content of posts. MyBB 1.8.39 resolves this issue.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

Prior to version 5.2.1, webpack-dev-server users' source code may be stolen when they access a malicious web site. Because the request for classic script by a script tag is not subject to same origin policy, an attacker can inject a malicious script in their site and run the script. Note that the attacker has to know the port and the output entrypoint script path. Combined with prototype pollution, the attacker can get a reference to the webpack runtime variables. By using `Function::toString` against the values in `__webpack_modules__`, the attacker can get the source code.

CVE-2025-24015	2025-06-03T23:15:20.633	2025-06-09T15:11:33.737	Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime. Versions 1.46.0 through 2.1.6 have an issue that affects AES-256-GCM and AES-128-GCM in Deno in which the authentication tag is not being validated. This means tampered ciphertexts or incorrect keys might not be detected, which breaks the guarantees expected from AES-GCM. Older versions of Deno correctly threw errors in such cases, as does Node.js. Without authentication tag verification, AES-GCM degrades to essentially CTR mode, removing integrity protection. Authenticated data set with set_aad is also affected, as it is incorporated into the GCM hash (ghash) but this too is not validated, rendering AAD checks ineffective. Version 2.1.7 includes a patch that addresses this issue.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request over the RMI interface to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the MIM Admin service. The RMI interface is only accessible locally (listening on 127.0.0.1), limiting the attack vector to the local machine.  This means that in a properly configured hospital environment, an attacker must have already compromised the network and additionally compromised the system where the MIM Admin service is running.  From there, attackers with sufficient knowledge of MIM's implementation, library usage, and functionality with access to extend the MIM RMI library could force the MIM Admin service to run commands on the local machine with its privileges.

Users of MIM Software products exposed via RDP or multi-user application virtualization system should take note that the system being exposed is the environment hosting the virtualized MIM client.

This occurs by combining a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue that occurs in `f.php` when SVG favicons are downloaded from an attacker-controlled feed containing `<script>` tags inside of them that aren't sanitized, with the lack of CSP in `f.php` by embedding the malicious favicon in an iframe (that has `sandbox=""allow-scripts allow-same-origin""` set as its attribute). An attacker needs to control one of the feeds that the victim is subscribed to, and also must have an account on the FreshRSS instance. Other than that, the iframe payload can be embedded as one of two options. The first payload requires user interaction (the user clicking on the malicious feed entry) with default user configuration, and the second payload fires instantly right after the user adds the feed or logs into the account while the feed entry is still visible. This is because of lazy image loading functionality, which the second payload bypasses. An attacker can gain access to the victim's account by exploiting this vulnerability.

CVE-2025-46341	2025-06-04T21:15:39.937	2025-08-12T15:34:36.367	FreshRSS is a self-hosted RSS feed aggregator. Prior to version 1.26.2, when the server is using HTTP auth via reverse proxy, it's possible to impersonate any user either via the `Remote-User` header or the `X-WebAuth-User` header by making specially crafted requests via the add feed functionality and obtaining the CSRF token via XPath scraping. The attacker has to know the IP address of the proxied FreshRSS instance and the admin's username, while also having an account on the instance. An attacker can send specially crafted requests in order to gain unauthorized access to internal services. This can also lead to privilege escalation like in the demonstrated scenario, although users that have setup OIDC are not affected by privilege escalation. Version 1.26.2 contains a patch for the issue.	7.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N

CVE-2025-49012	2025-06-05T23:15:21.303	2025-06-06T14:07:28.330	"Himmelblau is an interoperability suite for Microsoft Azure Entra ID and Intune. Himmelblau versions 0.9.0 through 0.9.14 and 1.00-alpha are vulnerable to a privilege escalation issue when Entra ID group-based access restrictions are configured using group display names instead of object IDs. Starting in version 0.9.0, Himmelblau introduced support for specifying group names in the `pam_allow_groups` configuration option. However, Microsoft Entra ID permits the creation of multiple groups with the same `displayName` via the Microsoft Graph API—even by non-admin users, depending on tenant settings. As a result, a user could create a personal group with the same name as a legitimate access group (e.g., `""Allow-Linux-Login""`), add themselves to it, and be granted authentication or `sudo` rights by Himmelblau. Because affected Himmelblau versions compare group names by either `displayName` or by the immutable `objectId`, this allows bypassing access control mechanisms intended to restrict login to members of official, centrally-managed groups. This issue is fixed in Himmelblau version **0.9.15** and later. In these versions, group name matching in `pam_allow_groups` has been deprecated and removed, and only group `objectId`s (GUIDs) may be specified for secure group-based filtering. To mitigate the issue without upgrading, replace all entries in `pam_allow_groups` with the objectId of the target Entra ID group(s) and/or audit your tenant for groups with duplicate display names using the Microsoft Graph API."	5.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

An authenticated attacker or any user whose actions generate a login event will have their password recorded; an administrator (or anyone with database read access) can then read those logs and retrieve every captured password.	4.9	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVE-2025-38000	2025-06-06T13:15:39.870	2025-06-06T14:06:58.193	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sch_hfsc: Fix qlen accounting bug when using peek in hfsc_enqueue()

When enqueuing the first packet to an HFSC class, hfsc_enqueue() calls the
child qdisc's peek() operation before incrementing sch->q.qlen and
sch->qstats.backlog. If the child qdisc uses qdisc_peek_dequeued(), this may
trigger an immediate dequeue and potential packet drop. In such cases,
qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() is called, but the HFSC qdisc's qlen and backlog
have not yet been updated, leading to inconsistent queue accounting. This
can leave an empty HFSC class in the active list, causing further
consequences like use-after-free.

This patch fixes the bug by moving the increment of sch->q.qlen and
sch->qstats.backlog before the call to the child qdisc's peek() operation.
This ensures that queue length and backlog are always accurate when packet
drops or dequeues are triggered during the peek."

CVE-2025-38001	2025-06-06T14:15:22.183	2025-07-13T19:15:23.090	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net_sched: hfsc: Address reentrant enqueue adding class to eltree twice

Savino says:
    ""We are writing to report that this recent patch
    (141d34391abbb315d68556b7c67ad97885407547) [1]
    can be bypassed, and a UAF can still occur when HFSC is utilized with
    NETEM.

    The patch only checks the cl->cl_nactive field to determine whether
    it is the first insertion or not [2], but this field is only
    incremented by init_vf [3].

    By using HFSC_RSC (which uses init_ed) [4], it is possible to bypass the
    check and insert the class twice in the eltree.
    Under normal conditions, this would lead to an infinite loop in
    hfsc_dequeue for the reasons we already explained in this report [5].

    However, if TBF is added as root qdisc and it is configured with a
    very low rate,
    it can be utilized to prevent packets from being dequeued.
    This behavior can be exploited to perform subsequent insertions in the
    HFSC eltree and cause a UAF.""

To fix both the UAF and the infinite loop, with netem as an hfsc child,
check explicitly in hfsc_enqueue whether the class is already in the eltree
whenever the HFSC_RSC flag is set.

io_uring/fdinfo: grab ctx->uring_lock around io_uring_show_fdinfo()

Not everything requires locking in there, which is why the 'has_lock'

Wrap the whole thing in a ->uring_lock trylock, and just return
with no output if we fail to grab it. The existing trylock() will
already have greatly diminished utility/output for the failure case.

CVE-2025-47950	2025-06-06T18:15:35.330	2025-08-15T16:24:26.957	CoreDNS is a DNS server that chains plugins. In versions prior to 1.12.2, a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the CoreDNS DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ) server implementation. The server previously created a new goroutine for every incoming QUIC stream without imposing any limits on the number of concurrent streams or goroutines. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could open a large number of streams, leading to uncontrolled memory consumption and eventually causing an Out Of Memory (OOM) crash — especially in containerized or memory-constrained environments. The patch in version 1.12.2 introduces two key mitigation mechanisms: `max_streams`, which caps the number of concurrent QUIC streams per connection with a default value of `256`; and `worker_pool_size`, which Introduces a server-wide, bounded worker pool to process incoming streams with a default value of `1024`. This eliminates the 1:1 stream-to-goroutine model and ensures that CoreDNS remains resilient under high concurrency.  Some workarounds are available for those who are unable to upgrade. Disable QUIC support by removing or commenting out the `quic://` block in the Corefile, use container runtime resource limits to detect and isolate excessive memory usage, and/or monitor QUIC connection patterns and alert on anomalies.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2025-49128	2025-06-06T22:15:23.427	2025-06-09T16:15:44.947	"Jackson-core contains core low-level incremental (""streaming"") parser and generator abstractions used by Jackson Data Processor. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.13.0, a flaw in jackson-core's `JsonLocation._appendSourceDesc` method allows up to 500 bytes of unintended memory content to be included in exception messages. When parsing JSON from a byte array with an offset and length, the exception message incorrectly reads from the beginning of the array instead of the logical payload start. This results in possible information disclosure in systems using pooled or reused buffers, like Netty or Vert.x. This issue was silently fixed in jackson-core version 2.13.0, released on September 30, 2021, via PR #652. All users should upgrade to version 2.13.0 or later. If upgrading is not immediately possible, applications can mitigate the issue by disabling exception message exposure to clients to avoid returning parsing exception messages in HTTP responses and/or disabling source inclusion in exceptions to prevent Jackson from embedding any source content in exception messages, avoiding leakage."	4.0	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

CVE-2025-49006	2025-06-09T13:15:23.650	2025-06-12T16:06:47.857	Wasp (Web Application Specification) is a Rails-like framework for React, Node.js, and Prisma. Prior to version 0.16.6, Wasp authentication has a vulnerability in the OAuth authentication implementation (affecting only Keycloak with a specific config). Wasp currently lowercases OAuth user IDs before storing / fetching them. This behavior violates OAuth and OpenID Connect specifications and can result in user impersonation, account collisions, and privilege escalation. In practice, out of the OAuth providers that Wasp auth supports, only Keycloak is affected. Keycloak uses a lowercase UUID by default, but users can configure it to be case sensitive, making it affected. Google, GitHub, and Discord use numerical IDs, making them not affected. Users should update their Wasp version to `0.16.6` which has a fix for the problematic behavior. Users using Keycloak can work around the issue by not using a case sensitive user ID in their realm configuration.					
CVE-2025-49013	2025-06-09T13:15:23.803	2025-06-12T16:06:47.857	WilderForge is a Wildermyth coremodding API. A critical vulnerability has been identified in multiple projects across the WilderForge organization. The issue arises from unsafe usage of `${{ github.event.review.body }}` and other user controlled variables directly inside shell script contexts in GitHub Actions workflows. This introduces a code injection vulnerability: a malicious actor submitting a crafted pull request review containing shell metacharacters or commands could execute arbitrary shell code on the GitHub Actions runner. This can lead to arbitrary command execution with the permissions of the workflow, potentially compromising CI infrastructure, secrets, and build outputs. Developers who maintain or contribute to the repos WilderForge/WilderForge, WilderForge/ExampleMod, WilderForge/WilderWorkspace, WilderForge/WildermythGameProvider, WilderForge/AutoSplitter, WilderForge/SpASM, WilderForge/thrixlvault, WilderForge/MassHash, and/or WilderForge/DLC_Disabler; as well as users who fork any of the above repositories and reuse affected GitHub Actions workflows, are affected. End users of any the above software and users who only install pre-built releases or artifacts are not affected. This vulnerability does not impact runtime behavior of the software or compiled outputs unless those outputs were produced during exploitation of this vulnerability. A current workaround is to disable GitHub Actions in affected repositories, or remove the affected workflows.	9.9	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

The Sandbox container (fastgpt-sandbox) is a specialized, isolated environment used by FastGPT to safely execute user-submitted or dynamically generated code in isolation.

Attackers could exploit this to read and overwrite arbitrary files and bypass Python module import restrictions. This is patched in version 4.9.11 by restricting the allowed system calls to a safer subset and additional descriptive error messaging.	6.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

CVE-2025-49004	2025-06-09T21:15:46.733	2025-06-12T16:06:47.857	Caido is a web security auditing toolkit. Prior to version 0.48.0, due to the lack of protection for DNS rebinding, Caido can be loaded on an attacker-controlled domain. This allows a malicious website to hijack the authentication flow of Caido and achieve code execution. A malicious website loaded in the browser can hijack the locally running Caido instance and achieve remote command execution during the initial setup. Even if the Caido instance is already configured, an attacker can initiate the authentication flow by performing DNS rebinding. In this case, the victim needs to authorize the request on dashboard.caido.io. Users should upgrade to version 0.48.0 to receive a patch.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2025-49137	2025-06-09T21:15:46.890	2025-07-30T17:36:14.653	HAX CMS PHP allows users to manage their microsite universe with a PHP backend. Prior to version 11.0.0, the application does not sufficiently sanitize user input, allowing for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code. The 'saveNode' and 'saveManifest' endpoints take user input and store it in the JSON schema for the site. This content is then rendered in the generated HAX site. Although the application does not allow users to supply a `script` tag, it does allow the use of other HTML tags to run JavaScript. Version 11.0.0 fixes the issue.	8.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N		
CVE-2025-49138	2025-06-09T21:15:47.047	2025-07-30T17:35:54.940	HAX CMS PHP allows users to manage their microsite universe with a PHP backend. Prior to version 11.0.0, an authenticated Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in the HAXCMS saveOutline endpoint allows a low-privileged user to read arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the location field written into site.json. This enables attackers to exfiltrate sensitive system files such as /etc/passwd, application secrets, or configuration files accessible to the web server (www-data). The vulnerability stems from the way the HAXCMS backend handles the location field in the site's outline. When a user sends a POST request to /system/api/saveOutline, the backend stores the provided location value directly into the site.json file associated with the site, without validating or sanitizing the input. Later the location parameter is interpreted by the CMS to resolve and load the content for a given node. If the location field contains a relative path like `../../../etc/passwd`, the application will attempt to read and render that file. Version 11.0.0 fixes the issue.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2025-49139	2025-06-09T21:15:47.203	2025-07-30T17:35:58.530	HAX CMS PHP allows users to manage their microsite universe with a PHP backend. Prior to version 11.0.0, in the HAX site editor, users can create a website block to load another site in an iframe. The application allows users to supply a target URL in the website block. When the HAX site is visited, the client's browser will query the supplied URL. An authenticated attacker can create a HAX site with a website block pointing at an attacker-controlled server running Responder or a similar tool. The attacker can then conduct a phishing attack by convincing another user to visit their malicious HAX site to harvest credentials. Version 11.0.0 contains a patch for the issue.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2025-49141	2025-06-09T21:15:47.360	2025-07-30T17:36:08.923	HAX CMS PHP allows users to manage their microsite universe with a PHP backend. Prior to version 11.0.3, the `gitImportSite` functionality obtains a URL string from a POST request and insufficiently validates user input. The `set_remote` function later passes this input into `proc_open`, yielding OS command injection. An authenticated attacker can craft a URL string that bypasses the validation checks employed by the `filter_var` and `strpos` functions in order to execute arbitrary OS commands on the backend server. The attacker can exfiltrate command output via an HTTP request. Version 11.0.3 contains a patch for the issue.	8.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

Apache Kafka Clients accept configuration data for setting the SASL/OAUTHBEARER connection with the brokers, including ""sasl.oauthbearer.token.endpoint.url"" and ""sasl.oauthbearer.jwks.endpoint.url"". Apache Kafka allows clients to read an arbitrary file and return the content in the error log, or sending requests to an unintended location. In applications where Apache Kafka Clients configurations can be specified by an untrusted party, attackers may use the ""sasl.oauthbearer.token.endpoint.url"" and ""sasl.oauthbearer.jwks.endpoint.url"" configuratin to read arbitrary contents of the disk and environment variables or make requests to an unintended location. In particular, this flaw may be used in Apache Kafka Connect to escalate from REST API access to filesystem/environment/URL access, which may be undesirable in certain environments, including SaaS products. 

Since Apache Kafka 3.9.1/4.0.0, we have added a system property (""-Dorg.apache.kafka.sasl.oauthbearer.allowed.urls"") to set the allowed urls in SASL JAAS configuration. In 3.9.1, it accepts all urls by default for backward compatibility. However in 4.0.0 and newer, the default value is empty list and users have to set the allowed urls explicitly."	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2025-27818	2025-06-10T08:15:22.533	2025-07-11T16:54:35.307	"A possible security vulnerability has been identified in Apache Kafka.
This requires access to a alterConfig to the cluster resource, or Kafka Connect worker, and the ability to create/modify connectors on it with an arbitrary Kafka client SASL JAAS config
and a SASL-based security protocol, which has been possible on Kafka clusters since Apache Kafka 2.0.0 (Kafka Connect 2.3.0).
When configuring the broker via config file or AlterConfig command, or connector via the Kafka Kafka Connect REST API, an authenticated operator can set the `sasl.jaas.config`
property for any of the connector's Kafka clients to ""com.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule"", which can be done via the
`producer.override.sasl.jaas.config`, `consumer.override.sasl.jaas.config`, or `admin.override.sasl.jaas.config` properties.
This will allow the server to connect to the attacker's LDAP server
and deserialize the LDAP response, which the attacker can use to execute java deserialization gadget chains on the Kafka connect server.
Attacker can cause unrestricted deserialization of untrusted data (or) RCE vulnerability when there are gadgets in the classpath.

Since Apache Kafka 3.0.0, users are allowed to specify these properties in connector configurations for Kafka Connect clusters running with out-of-the-box
configurations. Before Apache Kafka 3.0.0, users may not specify these properties unless the Kafka Connect cluster has been reconfigured with a connector
client override policy that permits them.

Since Apache Kafka 3.9.1/4.0.0, we have added a system property (""-Dorg.apache.kafka.disallowed.login.modules"") to disable the problematic login modules usage
in SASL JAAS configuration. Also by default ""com.sun.security.auth.module.JndiLoginModule,com.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule"" are disabled in Apache Kafka Connect 3.9.1/4.0.0. 

We advise the Kafka users to validate connector configurations and only allow trusted LDAP configurations. Also examine connector dependencies for 
vulnerable versions and either upgrade their connectors, upgrading that specific dependency, or removing the connectors as options for remediation. Finally,
in addition to leveraging the ""org.apache.kafka.disallowed.login.modules"" system property, Kafka Connect users can also implement their own connector
client config override policy, which can be used to control which Kafka client properties can be overridden directly in a connector config and which cannot."	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2025-49143	2025-06-10T16:15:42.450	2025-08-21T22:34:19.990	Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform. Prior to v2.4.10 and v1.6.32 , files uploaded by users to Nautobot's MEDIA_ROOT directory, including DeviceType image attachments as well as images attached to a Location, Device, or Rack, are served to users via a URL endpoint that was not enforcing user authentication. As a consequence, such files can be retrieved by anonymous users who know or can guess the correct URL for a given file. Nautobot v2.4.10 and v1.6.32 address this issue by adding enforcement of Nautobot user authentication to this endpoint.	5.9	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

Libtpms, which is derived from the TPM 2.0 reference implementation code published by the Trusted Computing Group, is prone to a potential out of bounds (OOB) read vulnerability. The vulnerability occurs in the ‘CryptHmacSign’ function with an inconsistent pairing of the signKey and signScheme parameters, where the signKey is ALG_KEYEDHASH key and inScheme is an ECC or RSA scheme. The reported vulnerability is in the ‘CryptHmacSign’ function, which is defined in the ""Part 4: Supporting Routines – Code"" document, section ""7.151 - /tpm/src/crypt/CryptUtil.c "". This vulnerability can be triggered from user-mode applications by sending malicious commands to a TPM 2.0/vTPM (swtpm) whose firmware is based on an affected TCG reference implementation. The effect on libtpms is that it will cause an abort due to the detection of the out-of-bounds access, thus for example making a vTPM (swtpm) unavailable to a VM.

CVE-2024-7457	2025-06-11T00:15:23.740	2025-06-12T16:06:20.180	The ws.stash.app.mac.daemon.helper tool contains a vulnerability caused by an incorrect use of macOS’s authorization model. Instead of validating the client's authorization reference, the helper invokes AuthorizationCopyRights() using its own privileged context (root), effectively authorizing itself rather than the client. As a result, it grants the system.preferences.admin right internally, regardless of the requesting client's privileges. This flawed logic allows unprivileged clients to invoke privileged operations via XPC, including unauthorized changes to system-wide network preferences such as SOCKS, HTTP, and HTTPS proxy settings. The absence of proper code-signing checks further enables arbitrary processes to exploit this flaw, leading to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks through traffic redirection.	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Since Rocket.Chat was not signed with the Hardened Runtime nor set to enforce Library Validation, it is vulnerable to DYLIB injection attacks, which can lead to unauthorized actions or escalation of permissions. Consequently, an attacker gains capabilities that are not permitted by default under the Sandbox and its application profile.	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

Archify follows the ""factored applications"" model, delegating privileged operations—such as arbitrary file deletion and file permission changes—to this helper running as root. However, the helper does not verify the code signature, entitlements, or signing flags of the connecting client. Although macOS provides secure validation mechanisms like auditToken, these are not implemented. As a result, any local process can establish a connection to the helper and invoke privileged functionality, leading to unauthorized execution of actions with root-level privileges."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2025-1055	2025-06-11T00:15:24.273	2025-06-12T16:06:20.180	A vulnerability in the K7RKScan.sys driver, part of the K7 Security Anti-Malware suite, allows a local low-privilege user to send crafted IOCTL requests to terminate a wide range of processes running with administrative or system-level privileges, with the exception of those inherently protected by the operating system. This flaw stems from missing access control in the driver's IOCTL handler, enabling unprivileged users to perform privileged actions in kernel space. Successful exploitation can lead to denial of service by disrupting critical services or privileged applications.	5.6	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2025-30675	2025-06-11T00:15:24.730	2025-07-01T20:14:05.047	"In Apache CloudStack, a flaw in access control affects the listTemplates and listIsos APIs. A malicious Domain Admin or Resource Admin can exploit this issue by intentionally specifying the 'domainid' parameter along with the 'filter=self' or 'filter=selfexecutable' values. This allows the attacker to gain unauthorized visibility into templates and ISOs under the ROOT domain.

A malicious admin can enumerate and extract metadata of templates and ISOs that belong to unrelated domains, violating isolation boundaries and potentially exposing sensitive or internal configuration details. 

This vulnerability has been fixed by ensuring the domain resolution strictly adheres to the caller's scope rather than defaulting to the ROOT domain.

CVE-2025-5986	2025-06-11T12:15:29.183	2025-07-02T16:07:00.620	A crafted HTML email using mailbox:/// links can trigger automatic, unsolicited downloads of .pdf files to the user's desktop or home directory without prompting, even if auto-saving is disabled. This behavior can be abused to fill the disk with garbage data (e.g. using /dev/urandom on Linux) or to leak Windows credentials via SMB links when the email is viewed in HTML mode. While user interaction is required to download the .pdf file, visual obfuscation can conceal the download trigger. Viewing the email in HTML mode is enough to load external content.

CVE-2025-41234	2025-06-12T22:15:21.090	2025-06-16T12:32:18.840	"Description

In Spring Framework, versions 6.0.x as of 6.0.5, versions 6.1.x and 6.2.x, an application is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack when it sets a “Content-Disposition” header with a non-ASCII charset, where the filename attribute is derived from user-supplied input.

Specifically, an application is vulnerable when all the following are true:

  *  The header is prepared with org.springframework.http.ContentDisposition.
  *  The filename is set via ContentDisposition.Builder#filename(String, Charset).
  *  The value for the filename is derived from user-supplied input.
  *  The application does not sanitize the user-supplied input.
  *  The downloaded content of the response is injected with malicious commands by the attacker (see RFD paper reference for details).


An application is not vulnerable if any of the following is true:

  *  The application does not set a “Content-Disposition” response header.
  *  The header is not prepared with org.springframework.http.ContentDisposition.
  *  The filename is set via one of:  *  ContentDisposition.Builder#filename(String), or
  *  ContentDisposition.Builder#filename(String, ASCII)



  *  The filename is not derived from user-supplied input.
  *  The filename is derived from user-supplied input but sanitized by the application.
  *  The attacker cannot inject malicious content in the downloaded content of the response.


Affected Spring Products and VersionsSpring Framework:

  *  6.2.0 - 6.2.7
  *  6.1.0 - 6.1.20
  *  6.0.5 - 6.0.28
  *  Older, unsupported versions are not affected

Any user with edit right on a page (could be the user's profile) can execute code (Groovy, Python, Velocity) with programming right by defining a wiki macro. This allows full access to the whole XWiki installation. The main problem is that if a wiki macro parameter allows wiki syntax, its default value is executed with the rights of the author of the document where it is used. This can be exploited by overriding a macro like the children macro that is used in a page that has programming right like the page XWiki.ChildrenMacro and thus allows arbitrary script macros. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 16.4.7, 16.10.3 and 17.0.0 by executing wiki parameters with the rights of the wiki macro's author when the parameter's value is the default value.	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

For most macros, the existing analyzers don't consider non-lowercase parameters. Further, most macro parameters that can contain XWiki syntax like titles of information boxes weren't analyzed at all. Similarly, the ""source"" parameters of the content and context macro weren't anylzed even though they could contain arbitrary XWiki syntax. In the worst case, this could allow a malicious to add malicious script macros including Groovy or Python macros to a page that are then executed after another user with programming righs edits the page, thus allowing remote code execution.

No malicious code can be executed, though, as while these templates allow Velocity code, the existing generic analyzer already warns admins before editing Velocity code. The main impact would thus be to send spam, e.g., with phishing links to other users or to hide notifications about other attacks. Note that warnings before editing documents with dangerous properties have only been introduced in XWiki 15.9, before that version, this was a known issue and the advice was simply to be careful.

In XWiki Platform versions 10.9 through 16.4.6, 16.5.0-rc-1 through 16.10.2, and 17.0.0-rc-1, the title of every single page whose reference is known can be accessed through the REST API as long as an XClass with a page property is accessible, this is the default for an XWiki installation. This allows an attacker to get titles of pages whose reference is known, one title per request. This doesn't affect fully private wikis as the REST endpoint checks access rights on the XClass definition. The impact on confidentiality depends on the strategy for page names. By default, page names match the title, so the impact should be low but if page names are intentionally obfuscated because the titles are sensitive, the impact could be high. This has been fixed in XWiki 16.4.7, 16.10.3 and 17.0.0 by adding access control checks before getting the title of any page.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVE-2025-32797	2025-06-16T19:15:33.510	2025-08-11T18:42:30.550	Conda-build contains commands and tools to build conda packages. Prior to version 25.3.1, The write_build_scripts function in conda-build creates the temporary build script conda_build.sh with overly permissive file permissions (0o766), allowing write access to all users. Attackers with filesystem access can exploit a race condition to overwrite the script before execution, enabling arbitrary code execution under the victim's privileges. This risk is significant in shared environments, potentially leading to full system compromise. Even with non-static directory names, attackers can monitor parent directories for file creation events. The brief window between script creation (with insecure permissions) and execution allows rapid overwrites. Directory names can also be inferred via timestamps or logs, and automation enables exploitation even with semi-randomized paths by acting within milliseconds of detection. This issue has been patched in version 25.3.1. A workaround involves restricting conda_build.sh permissions from 0o766 to 0o700 (owner-only read/write/execute). Additionally, use atomic file creation (write to a temporary randomized filename and rename atomically) to minimize the race condition window.	7.0	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2025-6087	2025-06-16T19:15:33.837	2025-08-06T17:21:28.460	"A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was identified in the @opennextjs/cloudflare package. The vulnerability stems from an unimplemented feature in the Cloudflare adapter for Open Next, which allowed unauthenticated users to proxy arbitrary remote content via the /_next/image endpoint.

This issue allowed attackers to load remote resources from arbitrary hosts under the victim site’s domain for any site deployed using the Cloudflare adapter for Open Next. 




For example:

 https://victim-site.com/_next/image?url=https://attacker.com 

In this example, attacker-controlled content from attacker.com is served through the victim site’s domain (victim-site.com), violating the same-origin policy and potentially misleading users or other services.




Impact:

  *  SSRF via unrestricted remote URL loading




  *  Arbitrary remote content loading




  *  Potential internal service exposure or phishing risks through domain abuse







Mitigation:

The following mitigations have been put in place:

  *  Server side updates to Cloudflare’s platform to restrict the content loaded via the /_next/image endpoint to images. The update automatically mitigates the issue for all existing and any future sites deployed to Cloudflare using the affected version of the Cloudflare adapter for Open Next




  *   Root cause fix https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-cloudflare/pull/727  to the Cloudflare adapter for Open Next. The patched version of the adapter is found here  @opennextjs/cloudflare@1.3.0 https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opennextjs/cloudflare/v/1.3.0 


  *   Package dependency update https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/9608  to create-cloudflare (c3) to use the fixed version of the Cloudflare adapter for Open Next. The patched version of create-cloudflare is found here:  create-cloudflare@2.49.3 https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare/v/2.49.3 




In addition to the automatic mitigation deployed on Cloudflare’s platform, we encourage affected  users to upgrade to @opennext/cloudflare v1.3.0 and use the  remotePatterns  https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#remotepatterns  filter in Next config https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#remotepatterns  if they need to allow-list external urls with images assets."	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

Prior to version 25.4.0, the conda-build recipe processing logic has been found to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to unsafe evaluation of recipe selectors. Currently, conda-build uses the eval function to process embedded selectors in meta.yaml files. This approach evaluates user-defined expressions without proper sanitization, which allows arbitrary code to be executed during the build process. As a result, the integrity of the build environment is compromised, and unauthorized commands or file operations may be performed. The vulnerability stems from the inherent risk of using eval() on untrusted input in a context intended to control dynamic build configurations. By directly interpreting selector expressions, conda-build creates a potential execution pathway for malicious code, violating security assumptions. This issue has been patched in version 25.4.0.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2025-27587	2025-06-16T22:15:44.093	2025-06-26T17:15:30.497	OpenSSL 3.0.0 through 3.3.2 on the PowerPC architecture is vulnerable to a Minerva attack, exploitable by measuring the time of signing of random messages using the EVP_DigestSign API, and then using the private key to extract the K value (nonce) from the signatures. Next, based on the bit size of the extracted nonce, one can compare the signing time of full-sized nonces to signatures that used smaller nonces, via statistical tests. There is a side-channel in the P-364 curve that allows private key extraction (also, there is a dependency between the bit size of K and the size of the side channel). NOTE: This CVE is disputed because the OpenSSL security policy explicitly notes that any side channels which require same physical system to be detected are outside of the threat model for the software. The timing signal is so small that it is infeasible to be detected without having the attacking process running on the same physical system.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

phy: tegra: xusb: Use a bitmask for UTMI pad power state tracking

The current implementation uses bias_pad_enable as a reference count to
manage the shared bias pad for all UTMI PHYs. However, during system
suspension with connected USB devices, multiple power-down requests for
the UTMI pad result in a mismatch in the reference count, which in turn
produces warnings such as:

The root cause was traced back to the dynamic power-down changes
introduced in commit a30951d31b25 (""xhci: tegra: USB2 pad power controls""),
where the UTMI pad was being powered down without verifying its current
state. This unbalanced behavior led to discrepancies in the reference
count.

To rectify this issue, this patch replaces the single reference counter
with a bitmask, renamed to utmi_pad_enabled. Each bit in the mask
corresponds to one of the four USB2 PHYs, allowing us to track each pad's
enablement status individually.

With this change:
  - The bias pad is powered on only when the mask is clear.
  - Each UTMI pad is powered on or down based on its corresponding bit
    in the mask, preventing redundant operations.
  - The overall power state of the shared bias pad is maintained
    correctly during suspend/resume cycles.

The mutex used to prevent race conditions during UTMI pad enable/disable
operations has been moved from the tegra186_utmi_bias_pad_power_on/off
functions to the parent functions tegra186_utmi_pad_power_on/down. This
change ensures that there are no race conditions when updating the bitmask."

HID: bpf: abort dispatch if device destroyed

The current HID bpf implementation assumes no output report/request will
go through it after hid_bpf_destroy_device() has been called. This leads
to a bug that unplugging certain types of HID devices causes a cleaned-
up SRCU to be accessed. The bug was previously a hidden failure until a
recent x86 percpu change [1] made it access not-present pages.

The bug will be triggered if the conditions below are met:

A) a device under the driver has some LEDs on
B) hid_ll_driver->request() is uninplemented (e.g., logitech-djreceiver)

If condition A is met, hidinput_led_worker() is always scheduled *after*
hid_bpf_destroy_device().

hid_destroy_device
` hid_bpf_destroy_device
  ` cleanup_srcu_struct(&hdev->bpf.srcu)
` hid_remove_device
  ` ...
    ` led_classdev_unregister
      ` led_trigger_set(led_cdev, NULL)
        ` led_set_brightness(led_cdev, LED_OFF)
          ` ...
            ` input_inject_event
              ` input_event_dispose
                ` hidinput_input_event
                  ` schedule_work(&hid->led_work) [hidinput_led_worker]

This is fine when condition B is not met, where hidinput_led_worker()
calls hid_ll_driver->request(). This is the case for most HID drivers,
which implement it or use the generic one from usbhid. The driver itself
or an underlying driver will then abort processing the request.

Otherwise, hidinput_led_worker() tries hid_hw_output_report() and leads
to the bug.

hidinput_led_worker
` hid_hw_output_report
  ` dispatch_hid_bpf_output_report
    ` srcu_read_lock(&hdev->bpf.srcu)
    ` srcu_read_unlock(&hdev->bpf.srcu, idx)

The bug has existed since the introduction [2] of
dispatch_hid_bpf_output_report(). However, the same bug also exists in
dispatch_hid_bpf_raw_requests(), and I've reproduced (no visible effect
because of the lack of [1], but confirmed bpf.destroyed == 1) the bug
against the commit (i.e., the Fixes:) introducing the function. This is
because hidinput_led_worker() falls back to hid_hw_raw_request() when
hid_ll_driver->output_report() is uninplemented (e.g., logitech-
djreceiver).

hidinput_led_worker
` hid_hw_output_report: -ENOSYS

  ` dispatch_hid_bpf_raw_requests
    ` srcu_read_lock(&hdev->bpf.srcu)
    ` srcu_read_unlock(&hdev->bpf.srcu, idx)

Fix the issue by returning early in the two mentioned functions if
hid_bpf has been marked as destroyed. Though
dispatch_hid_bpf_device_event() handles input events, and there is no
evidence that it may be called after the destruction, the same check, as
a safety net, is also added to it to maintain the consistency among all
dispatch functions.

The impact of the bug on other architectures is unclear. Even if it acts
as a hidden failure, this is still dangerous because it corrupts
whatever is on the address calculated by SRCU. Thus, CC'ing the stable
list.

fs/eventpoll: fix endless busy loop after timeout has expired

After commit 0a65bc27bd64 (""eventpoll: Set epoll timeout if it's in
the future""), the following program would immediately enter a busy
loop in the kernel:

```
int main() {
  int e = epoll_create1(0);
  struct epoll_event event = {.events = EPOLLIN};
  epoll_ctl(e, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, 0, &event);
  const struct timespec timeout = {.tv_nsec = 1};
  epoll_pwait2(e, &event, 1, &timeout, 0);
}
```

This happens because the given (non-zero) timeout of 1 nanosecond
usually expires before ep_poll() is entered and then
ep_schedule_timeout() returns false, but `timed_out` is never set
because the code line that sets it is skipped.  This quickly turns
into a soft lockup, RCU stalls and deadlocks, inflicting severe
headaches to the whole system.

When the timeout has expired, we don't need to schedule a hrtimer, but
we should set the `timed_out` variable.  Therefore, I suggest moving
the ep_schedule_timeout() check into the `timed_out` expression
instead of skipping it.

brauner: Note that there was an earlier fix by Joe Damato in response to
my bug report in [1]."

mlxsw: spectrum_router: Fix use-after-free when deleting GRE net devices

The driver only offloads neighbors that are constructed on top of net
devices registered by it or their uppers (which are all Ethernet). The
device supports GRE encapsulation and decapsulation of forwarded
traffic, but the driver will not offload dummy neighbors constructed on
top of GRE net devices as they are not uppers of its net devices:

 # ip link add name gre1 up type gre tos inherit local 192.0.2.1 remote 198.51.100.1
 # ip neigh add 0.0.0.0 lladdr 0.0.0.0 nud noarp dev gre1
 $ ip neigh show dev gre1 nud noarp
 0.0.0.0 lladdr 0.0.0.0 NOARP

(Note that the neighbor is not marked with 'offload')

When the driver is reloaded and the existing configuration is replayed,
the driver does not perform the same check regarding existing neighbors
and offloads the previously added one:

 # devlink dev reload pci/0000:01:00.0
 $ ip neigh show dev gre1 nud noarp
 0.0.0.0 lladdr 0.0.0.0 offload NOARP

If the neighbor is later deleted, the driver will ignore the
notification (given the GRE net device is not its upper) and will
therefore keep referencing freed memory, resulting in a use-after-free
[1] when the net device is deleted:

 # ip neigh del 0.0.0.0 lladdr 0.0.0.0 dev gre1
 # ip link del dev gre1

Fix by skipping neighbor replay if the net device for which the replay
is performed is not our upper.

regulator: max20086: fix invalid memory access

max20086_parse_regulators_dt() calls of_regulator_match() using an
array of struct of_regulator_match allocated on the stack for the
matches argument.

of_regulator_match() calls devm_of_regulator_put_matches(), which calls
devres_alloc() to allocate a struct devm_of_regulator_matches which will
be de-allocated using devm_of_regulator_put_matches().

struct devm_of_regulator_matches is populated with the stack allocated
matches array.

If the device fails to probe, devm_of_regulator_put_matches() will be
called and will try to call of_node_put() on that stack pointer,
generating the following dmesg entries:

max20086 6-0028: Failed to read DEVICE_ID reg: -121
kobject: '\xc0$\xa5\x03' (000000002cebcb7a): is not initialized, yet
kobject_put() is being called.

Followed by a stack trace matching the call flow described above.

Switch to allocating the matches array using devm_kcalloc() to
avoid accessing the stack pointer long after it's out of scope.

This also has the advantage of allowing multiple max20086 to probe
without overriding the data stored inside the global of_regulator_match."

padata: do not leak refcount in reorder_work

A recent patch that addressed a UAF introduced a reference count leak:
the parallel_data refcount is incremented unconditionally, regardless
of the return value of queue_work(). If the work item is already queued,
the incremented refcount is never decremented.

Fix this by checking the return value of queue_work() and decrementing
the refcount when necessary.

This happens because core::fmt::write() calls
core::fmt::rt::Argument::fmt(), which currently has CFI disabled:

library/core/src/fmt/rt.rs:
171     // FIXME: Transmuting formatter in new and indirectly branching to/calling

This causes a Control Protection exception, because FineIBT has sealed
off the original function's endbr64.

This makes rust currently incompatible with FineIBT. Add a Kconfig
dependency that prevents FineIBT from getting turned on by default
if rust is enabled.

[ Rust 1.88.0 (scheduled for 2025-06-26) should have this fixed [1],
  and thus we relaxed the condition with Rust >= 1.88.

  When `objtool` lands checking for this with e.g. [2], the plan is
  to ideally run that in upstream Rust's CI to prevent regressions
  early [3], since we do not control `core`'s source code.

  Alice tested the Rust PR backported to an older compiler.

  Peter would like that Rust provides a stable `core` which can be
  pulled into the kernel: ""Relying on that much out of tree code is
  'unfortunate'"".

nvmet-tcp: don't restore null sk_state_change

queue->state_change is set as part of nvmet_tcp_set_queue_sock(), but if
the TCP connection isn't established when nvmet_tcp_set_queue_sock() is
called then queue->state_change isn't set and sock->sk->sk_state_change
isn't replaced.

As such we don't need to restore sock->sk->sk_state_change if
queue->state_change is NULL.

This avoids NULL pointer dereferences such as this:

drm/xe/vf: Perform early GT MMIO initialization to read GMDID

VFs need to communicate with the GuC to obtain the GMDID value
and existing GuC functions used for that assume that the GT has
it's MMIO members already setup. However, due to recent refactoring
the gt->mmio is initialized later, and any attempt by the VF to use
xe_mmio_read|write() from GuC functions will lead to NPD crash due
to unset MMIO register address:

[] xe 0000:00:02.1: [drm] Running in SR-IOV VF mode

[] BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: 0000000000190240

Since we are already tweaking the id and type of the primary GT to
mimic it's a Media GT before initializing the GuC communication,
we can also call xe_gt_mmio_init() to perform early setup of the
gt->mmio which will make those GuC functions work again."

The user of k3_udma_glue_reset_rx_chn() e.g. ti_am65_cpsw_nuss can
run on multiple platforms having different DMA architectures.
On some platforms there can be one FDQ for all flows in the RX channel
while for others there is a separate FDQ for each flow in the RX channel.

So far we have been relying on the skip_fdq argument of
k3_udma_glue_reset_rx_chn().

Instead of relying on the user to provide this information, infer it
based on DMA architecture during k3_udma_glue_request_rx_chn() and save it
in an internal flag 'single_fdq'. Use that flag at
k3_udma_glue_reset_rx_chn() to deicide if the FDQ needs
to be cleared for every flow or just for flow 0.

x86/fred: Fix system hang during S4 resume with FRED enabled

Upon a wakeup from S4, the restore kernel starts and initializes the
FRED MSRs as needed from its perspective.  It then loads a hibernation
image, including the image kernel, and attempts to load image pages
directly into their original page frames used before hibernation unless
those frames are currently in use.  Once all pages are moved to their
original locations, it jumps to a ""trampoline"" page in the image kernel.

At this point, the image kernel takes control, but the FRED MSRs still
contain values set by the restore kernel, which may differ from those
set by the image kernel before hibernation.  Therefore, the image kernel
must ensure the FRED MSRs have the same values as before hibernation.
Since these values depend only on the location of the kernel text and
data, they can be recomputed from scratch."

number of initialized elements, with a maximum of 4 per array.
The summary output functions are updated to respect these limits,
preventing out-of-bounds access and ensuring safe array handling.

perf/x86/intel: Fix segfault with PEBS-via-PT with sample_freq

Currently, using PEBS-via-PT with a sample frequency instead of a sample
period, causes a segfault.  For example:

That happens because intel_pmu_pebs_event_update_no_drain() assumes all the
pebs_enabled bits represent counter indexes, which is not always the case.
In this particular case, bits 60 and 61 are set for PEBS-via-PT purposes.

The behaviour of PEBS-via-PT with sample frequency is questionable because
although a PMI is generated (PEBS_PMI_AFTER_EACH_RECORD), the period is not
adjusted anyway.

Putting that aside, fix intel_pmu_pebs_event_update_no_drain() by passing
the mask of counter bits instead of 'size'.  Note, prior to the Fixes
commit, 'size' would be limited to the maximum counter index, so the issue
was not hit."

[CAUSE]
Mount option ""rescue=idatacsums"" will completely skip loading the csum
tree, so that any data read will not find any data csum thus we will
ignore data checksum verification.

Normally call sites utilizing csum tree will check the fs state flag
NO_DATA_CSUMS bit, but unfortunately scrub does not check that bit at all.

This results in scrub to call btrfs_search_slot() on a NULL pointer
and triggered above crash.

Check both extent and csum tree root before doing any tree search."

genirq/msi: Store the IOMMU IOVA directly in msi_desc instead of iommu_cookie

The IOMMU translation for MSI message addresses has been a 2-step process,
separated in time:

 1) iommu_dma_prepare_msi(): A cookie pointer containing the IOVA address
    is stored in the MSI descriptor when an MSI interrupt is allocated.

 2) iommu_dma_compose_msi_msg(): this cookie pointer is used to compute a
    translated message address.

This has an inherent lifetime problem for the pointer stored in the cookie
that must remain valid between the two steps. However, there is no locking
at the irq layer that helps protect the lifetime. Today, this works under
the assumption that the iommu domain is not changed while MSI interrupts
being programmed. This is true for normal DMA API users within the kernel,
as the iommu domain is attached before the driver is probed and cannot be
changed while a driver is attached.

Classic VFIO type1 also prevented changing the iommu domain while VFIO was
running as it does not support changing the ""container"" after starting up.

However, iommufd has improved this so that the iommu domain can be changed
during VFIO operation. This potentially allows userspace to directly race
VFIO_DEVICE_ATTACH_IOMMUFD_PT (which calls iommu_attach_group()) and
VFIO_DEVICE_SET_IRQS (which calls into iommu_dma_compose_msi_msg()).

This potentially causes both the cookie pointer and the unlocked call to
iommu_get_domain_for_dev() on the MSI translation path to become UAFs.

Fix the MSI cookie UAF by removing the cookie pointer. The translated IOVA
address is already known during iommu_dma_prepare_msi() and cannot change.
Thus, it can simply be stored as an integer in the MSI descriptor.

The other UAF related to iommu_get_domain_for_dev() will be addressed in
patch ""iommu: Make iommu_dma_prepare_msi() into a generic operation"" by
using the IOMMU group mutex."

rseq: Fix segfault on registration when rseq_cs is non-zero

The rseq_cs field is documented as being set to 0 by user-space prior to
registration, however this is not currently enforced by the kernel. This
can result in a segfault on return to user-space if the value stored in
the rseq_cs field doesn't point to a valid struct rseq_cs.

The correct solution to this would be to fail the rseq registration when
the rseq_cs field is non-zero. However, some older versions of glibc
will reuse the rseq area of previous threads without clearing the
rseq_cs field and will also terminate the process if the rseq
registration fails in a secondary thread. This wasn't caught in testing
because in this case the leftover rseq_cs does point to a valid struct
rseq_cs.

What we can do is clear the rseq_cs field on registration when it's
non-zero which will prevent segfaults on registration and won't break
the glibc versions that reuse rseq areas on thread creation."

PCI: endpoint: pci-epf-test: Fix double free that causes kernel to oops

Fix a kernel oops found while testing the stm32_pcie Endpoint driver
with handling of PERST# deassertion:

During EP initialization, pci_epf_test_alloc_space() allocates all BARs,
which are further freed if epc_set_bar() fails (for instance, due to no
free inbound window).

However, when pci_epc_set_bar() fails, the error path:

  pci_epc_set_bar() ->
    pci_epf_free_space()

does not clear the previous assignment to epf_test->reg[bar].

Then, if the host reboots, the PERST# deassertion restarts the BAR
allocation sequence with the same allocation failure (no free inbound
window), creating a double free situation since epf_test->reg[bar] was
deallocated and is still non-NULL.

Thus, make sure that pci_epf_alloc_space() and pci_epf_free_space()
invocations are symmetric, and as such, set epf_test->reg[bar] to NULL
when memory is freed.

CVE-2025-38073	2025-06-18T10:15:40.720	2025-06-18T13:46:52.973	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: fix race between set_blocksize and read paths

With the new large sector size support, it's now the case that
set_blocksize can change i_blksize and the folio order in a manner that
conflicts with a concurrent reader and causes a kernel crash.

Specifically, let's say that udev-worker calls libblkid to detect the
labels on a block device.  The read call can create an order-0 folio to
read the first 4096 bytes from the disk.  But then udev is preempted.

Next, someone tries to mount an 8k-sectorsize filesystem from the same
block device.  The filesystem calls set_blksize, which sets i_blksize to
8192 and the minimum folio order to 1.

Now udev resumes, still holding the order-0 folio it allocated.  It then
tries to schedule a read bio and do_mpage_readahead tries to create
bufferheads for the folio.  Unfortunately, blocks_per_folio == 0 because
the page size is 4096 but the blocksize is 8192 so no bufferheads are
attached and the bh walk never sets bdev.  We then submit the bio with a
NULL block device and crash.

Therefore, truncate the page cache after flushing but before updating
i_blksize.  However, that's not enough -- we also need to lock out file
IO and page faults during the update.  Take both the i_rwsem and the
invalidate_lock in exclusive mode for invalidations, and in shared mode
for read/write operations.

The reason for the warning is clear enough; the driver sends an
unusual read request on endpoint 0 but does not set the USB_DIR_IN bit
in the bRequestType field.

More importantly, the whole situation can be avoided and the driver
simplified by converting it over to the relatively new
usb_control_msg_recv() and usb_control_msg_send() routines.  That's
what this fix does."

binder: fix UAF of ref->proc caused by race condition

A transaction of type BINDER_TYPE_WEAK_HANDLE can fail to increment the
reference for a node. In this case, the target proc normally releases
the failed reference upon close as expected. However, if the target is
dying in parallel the call will race with binder_deferred_release(), so
the target could have released all of its references by now leaving the
cleanup of the new failed reference unhandled.

The transaction then ends and the target proc gets released making the
ref->proc now a dangling pointer. Later on, ref->node is closed and we
attempt to take spin_lock(&ref->proc->inner_lock), which leads to the
use-after-free bug reported below. Let's fix this by cleaning up the
failed reference on the spot instead of relying on the target to do so.

A null pointer dereference can happen when attempting to access the
""gsm->receive()"" function in gsmld_receive_buf(). Currently, the code
assumes that gsm->recieve is only called after MUX activation.
Since the gsmld_receive_buf() function can be accessed without the need to
initialize the MUX, the gsm->receive() function will not be set and a
NULL pointer dereference will occur.

Fix this by avoiding the call to ""gsm->receive()"" in case the function is

Evidently this was caused by the scope of udc_mutex being too large.
The mutex is only meant to protect udc->driver along with a few other
things.  As far as I can tell, there's no reason for the mutex to be
held while the gadget core calls a gadget driver's ->bind or ->unbind
routine, or while a UDC is being started or stopped.  (This accounts
for link #1 in the chain above, where the mutex is held while the
dwc2_hsotg_udc is started as part of driver probing.)

Gadget drivers' ->disconnect callbacks are problematic.  Even though
usb_gadget_disconnect() will now acquire the udc_mutex, there's a
window in usb_gadget_bind_driver() between the times when the mutex is
released and the ->bind callback is invoked.  If a disconnect occurred
during that window, we could call the driver's ->disconnect routine
before its ->bind routine.  To prevent this from happening, it will be
necessary to prevent a UDC from connecting while it has no gadget
driver.  This should be done already but it doesn't seem to be;
currently usb_gadget_connect() has no check for this.  Such a check
will have to be added later.

Some degree of mutual exclusion is required in soft_connect_store(),
which can dereference udc->driver at arbitrary times since it is a
sysfs callback.  The solution here is to acquire the gadget's device
lock rather than the udc_mutex.  Since the driver core guarantees that
the device lock is always held during driver binding and unbinding,
this will make the accesses in soft_connect_store() mutually exclusive
with any changes to udc->driver.

Lastly, it turns out there is one place which should hold the
udc_mutex but currently does not: The function_show() routine needs
protection while it dereferences udc->driver.  The missing lock and
unlock calls are added."

caused NULL dereference at reading the power supply sysfs.  It's a
stale sysfs entry that should have been removed but remains with NULL

a NULL con->wq, and this leaves the power device unreleased.

hwmon: (gpio-fan) Fix array out of bounds access

The driver does not check if the cooling state passed to
gpio_fan_set_cur_state() exceeds the maximum cooling state as
stored in fan_data->num_speeds. Since the cooling state is later
used as an array index in set_fan_speed(), an array out of bounds
access can occur.
This can be exploited by setting the state of the thermal cooling device
to arbitrary values, causing for example a kernel oops when unavailable
memory is accessed this way.

fw_upload_priv structure before it is dereferenced for the call to
module_put(). This bug was found by the kernel test robot using
CONFIG_KASAN while running the firmware selftests.

CVE-2022-49961	2025-06-18T11:15:23.347	2025-06-18T13:46:52.973	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Do mark_chain_precision for ARG_CONST_ALLOC_SIZE_OR_ZERO

Precision markers need to be propagated whenever we have an ARG_CONST_*
style argument, as the verifier cannot consider imprecise scalars to be
equivalent for the purposes of states_equal check when such arguments
refine the return value (in this case, set mem_size for PTR_TO_MEM). The
resultant mem_size for the R0 is derived from the constant value, and if
the verifier incorrectly prunes states considering them equivalent where
such arguments exist (by seeing that both registers have reg->precise as
false in regsafe), we can end up with invalid programs passing the
verifier which can do access beyond what should have been the correct
mem_size in that explored state.

To show a concrete example of the problem:

0000000000000000 <prog>:
       0:       r2 = *(u32 *)(r1 + 80)
       1:       r1 = *(u32 *)(r1 + 76)
       2:       r3 = r1
       3:       r3 += 4
       4:       if r3 > r2 goto +18 <LBB5_5>
       5:       w2 = 0
       6:       *(u32 *)(r1 + 0) = r2
       7:       r1 = *(u32 *)(r1 + 0)
       8:       r2 = 1
       9:       if w1 == 0 goto +1 <LBB5_3>
      10:       r2 = -1

0000000000000058 <LBB5_3>:
      11:       r1 = 0 ll
      13:       r3 = 0
      14:       call bpf_ringbuf_reserve
      15:       if r0 == 0 goto +7 <LBB5_5>
      16:       r1 = r0
      17:       r1 += 16777215
      18:       w2 = 0
      19:       *(u8 *)(r1 + 0) = r2
      20:       r1 = r0
      21:       r2 = 0
      22:       call bpf_ringbuf_submit

00000000000000b8 <LBB5_5>:
      23:       w0 = 0
      24:       exit

For the first case, the single line execution's exploration will prune
the search at insn 14 for the branch insn 9's second leg as it will be
verified first using r2 = -1 (UINT_MAX), while as w1 at insn 9 will
always be 0 so at runtime we don't get error for being greater than
UINT_MAX/4 from bpf_ringbuf_reserve. The verifier during regsafe just
sees reg->precise as false for both r2 registers in both states, hence
considers them equal for purposes of states_equal.

If we propagated precise markers using the backtracking support, we
would use the precise marking to then ensure that old r2 (UINT_MAX) was
within the new r2 (1) and this would never be true, so the verification
would rightfully fail.

The end result is that the out of bounds access at instruction 19 would
be permitted without this fix.

Note that reg->precise is always set to true when user does not have
CAP_BPF (or when subprog count is greater than 1 (i.e. use of any static
or global functions)), hence this is only a problem when precision marks
need to be explicitly propagated (i.e. privileged users with CAP_BPF).

A simplified test case has been included in the next patch to prevent
future regressions."

drm/i915/ttm: fix CCS handling

Crucible + recent Mesa seems to sometimes hit:

GEM_BUG_ON(num_ccs_blks > NUM_CCS_BLKS_PER_XFER)

And it looks like we can also trigger this with gem_lmem_swapping, if we
modify the test to use slightly larger object sizes.

Looking closer it looks like we have the following issues in
migrate_copy():

  - We are using plain integer in various places, which we can easily
    overflow with a large object.

  - We pass the entire object size (when the src is lmem) into
    emit_pte() and then try to copy it, which doesn't work, since we
    only have a few fixed sized windows in which to map the pages and
    perform the copy. With an object > 8M we therefore aren't properly
    copying the pages. And then with an object > 64M we trigger the
    GEM_BUG_ON(num_ccs_blks > NUM_CCS_BLKS_PER_XFER).

So it looks like our copy handling for any object > 8M (which is our
CHUNK_SZ) is currently broken on DG2.

Failslab injection will cause kmalloc fail and fall back to

During SMC fallback process in connect syscall, kernel will
replaces TCP with SMC. In order to forward wakeup
smc socket waitqueue after fallback, kernel will sets
clcsk->sk_user_data to origin smc socket in
smc_fback_replace_callbacks().

Later, in shutdown syscall, kernel will calls
sk_psock_get(), which treats the clcsk->sk_user_data
as psock type, triggering the refcnt warning.

So, the root cause is that smc and psock, both will use
sk_user_data field. So they will mismatch this field
easily.

This patch solves it by using another bit(defined as
SK_USER_DATA_PSOCK) in PTRMASK, to mark whether
sk_user_data points to a psock object or not.
This patch depends on a PTRMASK introduced in commit f1ff5ce2cd5e
(""net, sk_msg: Clear sk_user_data pointer on clone if tagged"").

For there will possibly be more flags in the sk_user_data field,
this patch also refactor sk_user_data flags code to be more generic

The problem here is that a range of tnum_range(0, map->max_entries - 1) has
limited ability to represent the concrete tight range with the tnum as the
set of resulting states from value + mask can result in a superset of the
actual intended range, and as such a tnum_in(range, reg->var_off) check may
yield true when it shouldn't, for example tnum_range(0, 2) would result in
00XX -> v = 0000, m = 0011 such that the intended set of {0, 1, 2} is here
represented by a less precise superset of {0, 1, 2, 3}. As the register is
known const scalar, really just use the concrete reg->var_off.value for the
upper index check."

The error exit of privcmd_ioctl_dm_op() is calling unlock_pages()

Additionally lock_pages() doesn't check for pin_user_pages_fast()
having been completely successful, resulting in potentially not
locking all pages into memory. This could result in sporadic failures
when using the related memory in user mode.

Fix all of that by calling unlock_pages() always with the real number

s390: fix double free of GS and RI CBs on fork() failure

The pointers for guarded storage and runtime instrumentation control
blocks are stored in the thread_struct of the associated task. These
pointers are initially copied on fork() via arch_dup_task_struct()
and then cleared via copy_thread() before fork() returns. If fork()
happens to fail after the initial task dup and before copy_thread(),
the newly allocated task and associated thread_struct memory are
freed via free_task() -> arch_release_task_struct(). This results in
a double free of the guarded storage and runtime info structs
because the fields in the failed task still refer to memory
associated with the source task.

This problem can manifest as a BUG_ON() in set_freepointer() (with
CONFIG_SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED enabled) or KASAN splat (if enabled)
when running trinity syscall fuzz tests on s390x. To avoid this
problem, clear the associated pointer fields in
arch_dup_task_struct() immediately after the new task is copied.
Note that the RI flag is still cleared in copy_thread() because it
resides in thread stack memory and that is where stack info is
copied."

CVE-2022-49993	2025-06-18T11:15:26.977	2025-06-18T13:46:52.973	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

loop: Check for overflow while configuring loop

The userspace can configure a loop using an ioctl call, wherein
a configuration of type loop_config is passed (see lo_ioctl()'s
case on line 1550 of drivers/block/loop.c). This proceeds to call
loop_configure() which in turn calls loop_set_status_from_info()
(see line 1050 of loop.c), passing &config->info which is of type
loop_info64*. This function then sets the appropriate values, like
the offset.

loop_device has lo_offset of type loff_t (see line 52 of loop.c),
which is typdef-chained to long long, whereas loop_info64 has
lo_offset of type __u64 (see line 56 of include/uapi/linux/loop.h).

The function directly copies offset from info to the device as
follows (See line 980 of loop.c):
	lo->lo_offset = info->lo_offset;

This results in an overflow, which triggers a warning in iomap_iter()
due to a call to iomap_iter_done() which has:
	WARN_ON_ONCE(iter->iomap.offset > iter->pos);

Thus, check for negative value during loop_set_status_from_info().

rxrpc: Fix locking in rxrpc's sendmsg

Fix three bugs in the rxrpc's sendmsg implementation:

 (1) rxrpc_new_client_call() should release the socket lock when returning
     an error from rxrpc_get_call_slot().

 (2) rxrpc_wait_for_tx_window_intr() will return without the call mutex
     held in the event that we're interrupted by a signal whilst waiting
     for tx space on the socket or relocking the call mutex afterwards.

     Fix this by: (a) moving the unlock/lock of the call mutex up to
     rxrpc_send_data() such that the lock is not held around all of
     rxrpc_wait_for_tx_window*() and (b) indicating to higher callers
     whether we're return with the lock dropped.  Note that this means
     recvmsg() will not block on this call whilst we're waiting.

 (3) After dropping and regaining the call mutex, rxrpc_send_data() needs
     to go and recheck the state of the tx_pending buffer and the
     tx_total_len check in case we raced with another sendmsg() on the same
     call.

Thinking on this some more, it might make sense to have different locks for
sendmsg() and recvmsg().  There's probably no need to make recvmsg() wait
for sendmsg().  It does mean that recvmsg() can return MSG_EOR indicating
that a call is dead before a sendmsg() to that call returns - but that can
currently happen anyway.

Without fix (2), something like the following can be induced:

CVE-2022-49999	2025-06-18T11:15:27.673	2025-06-18T13:46:52.973	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix space cache corruption and potential double allocations

When testing space_cache v2 on a large set of machines, we encountered a
few symptoms:

1. ""unable to add free space :-17"" (EEXIST) errors.
2. Missing free space info items, sometimes caught with a ""missing free
   space info for X"" error.
3. Double-accounted space: ranges that were allocated in the extent tree
   and also marked as free in the free space tree, ranges that were
   marked as allocated twice in the extent tree, or ranges that were
   marked as free twice in the free space tree. If the latter made it
   onto disk, the next reboot would hit the BUG_ON() in
   add_new_free_space().
4. On some hosts with no on-disk corruption or error messages, the
   in-memory space cache (dumped with drgn) disagreed with the free
   space tree.

All of these symptoms have the same underlying cause: a race between
caching the free space for a block group and returning free space to the
in-memory space cache for pinned extents causes us to double-add a free
range to the space cache. This race exists when free space is cached
from the free space tree (space_cache=v2) or the extent tree
(nospace_cache, or space_cache=v1 if the cache needs to be regenerated).
struct btrfs_block_group::last_byte_to_unpin and struct
btrfs_block_group::progress are supposed to protect against this race,
but commit d0c2f4fa555e (""btrfs: make concurrent fsyncs wait less when
waiting for a transaction commit"") subtly broke this by allowing
multiple transactions to be unpinning extents at the same time.

Specifically, the race is as follows:

1. An extent is deleted from an uncached block group in transaction A.
2. btrfs_commit_transaction() is called for transaction A.
3. btrfs_run_delayed_refs() -> __btrfs_free_extent() runs the delayed
   ref for the deleted extent.
4. __btrfs_free_extent() -> do_free_extent_accounting() ->
   add_to_free_space_tree() adds the deleted extent back to the free
   space tree.
5. do_free_extent_accounting() -> btrfs_update_block_group() ->
   btrfs_cache_block_group() queues up the block group to get cached.
   block_group->progress is set to block_group->start.
6. btrfs_commit_transaction() for transaction A calls
   switch_commit_roots(). It sets block_group->last_byte_to_unpin to
   block_group->progress, which is block_group->start because the block
   group hasn't been cached yet.
7. The caching thread gets to our block group. Since the commit roots
   were already switched, load_free_space_tree() sees the deleted extent
   as free and adds it to the space cache. It finishes caching and sets
   block_group->progress to U64_MAX.
8. btrfs_commit_transaction() advances transaction A to
   TRANS_STATE_SUPER_COMMITTED.
9. fsync calls btrfs_commit_transaction() for transaction B. Since
   transaction A is already in TRANS_STATE_SUPER_COMMITTED and the
   commit is for fsync, it advances.
10. btrfs_commit_transaction() for transaction B calls
    switch_commit_roots(). This time, the block group has already been
    cached, so it sets block_group->last_byte_to_unpin to U64_MAX.
11. btrfs_commit_transaction() for transaction A calls
    btrfs_finish_extent_commit(), which calls unpin_extent_range() for
    the deleted extent. It sees last_byte_to_unpin set to U64_MAX (by
    transaction B!), so it adds the deleted extent to the space cache
    again!

This explains all of our symptoms above:

* If the sequence of events is exactly as described above, when the free
  space is re-added in step 11, it will fail with EEXIST.
* If another thread reallocates the deleted extent in between steps 7
  and 11, then step 11 will silently re-add that space to the space
  cache as free even though it is actually allocated. Then, if that
  space is allocated *again*, the free space tree will be corrupted
  (namely, the wrong item will be deleted).
* If we don't catch this free space tree corr

CVE-2022-50000	2025-06-18T11:15:27.817	2025-06-18T13:46:52.973	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: flowtable: fix stuck flows on cleanup due to pending work

To clear the flow table on flow table free, the following sequence
normally happens in order:

  1) gc_step work is stopped to disable any further stats/del requests.
  2) All flow table entries are set to teardown state.
  3) Run gc_step which will queue HW del work for each flow table entry.
  4) Waiting for the above del work to finish (flush).
  5) Run gc_step again, deleting all entries from the flow table.
  6) Flow table is freed.

But if a flow table entry already has pending HW stats or HW add work
step 3 will not queue HW del work (it will be skipped), step 4 will wait
for the pending add/stats to finish, and step 5 will queue HW del work
which might execute after freeing of the flow table.

To fix the above, this patch flushes the pending work, then it sets the
teardown flag to all flows in the flowtable and it forces a garbage
collector run to queue work to remove the flows from hardware, then it
flushes this new pending work and (finally) it forces another garbage
collector run to remove the entry from the software flowtable.

The core issue is asymmetry in setting MLX5_LAG_FLAG_NDEVS_READY and
clearing it. Setting it is done wrongly when both
ldev->pf[MLX5_LAG_P0].dev and ldev->pf[MLX5_LAG_P1].dev are set;
clearing it is done right when either of ldev->pf[i].netdev is cleared.

Consider the following scenario:
1. PF0 loads and sets ldev->pf[MLX5_LAG_P0].dev to a valid pointer
2. PF1 loads and sets both ldev->pf[MLX5_LAG_P1].dev and
   ldev->pf[MLX5_LAG_P1].netdev with valid pointers. This results in
   MLX5_LAG_FLAG_NDEVS_READY is set.
3. PF0 is unloaded before setting dev->pf[MLX5_LAG_P0].netdev.
   MLX5_LAG_FLAG_NDEVS_READY remains set.

At this moment ice's XSK logic is tightly bound to act on a ""queue pair"",
e.g. both Tx and Rx queues at a given queue id are disabled/enabled and
both of them will get XSK pool assigned, which is broken for the presented
queue configuration. This results in the splat included at the bottom,
which is basically an OOB access to Rx ring array.

To fix this, allow using the ids only in scope of ""combined"" queues
reported by ethtool. However, logic should be rewritten to allow such
configurations later on, which would end up as a complete rewrite of the
control path, so let us go with this temporary fix.

xfrm: policy: fix metadata dst->dev xmit null pointer dereference

When we try to transmit an skb with metadata_dst attached (i.e. dst->dev
== NULL) through xfrm interface we can hit a null pointer dereference[1]
in xfrmi_xmit2() -> xfrm_lookup_with_ifid() due to the check for a
loopback skb device when there's no policy which dereferences dst->dev
unconditionally. Not having dst->dev can be interepreted as it not being
a loopback device, so just add a check for a null dst_orig->dev.

With this fix xfrm interface's Tx error counters go up as usual.

nfc: pn533: Fix use-after-free bugs caused by pn532_cmd_timeout

When the pn532 uart device is detaching, the pn532_uart_remove()
is called. But there are no functions in pn532_uart_remove() that
could delete the cmd_timeout timer, which will cause use-after-free
bugs. The process is shown below:

    (thread 1)                  |        (thread 2)
                                |  pn532_uart_send_frame

  ...                           |    (wait a time)

                                |        pn532->... //USE

This patch adds del_timer_sync() in pn532_uart_remove() in order to
prevent the use-after-free bugs. What's more, the pn53x_unregister_nfc()
is well synchronized, it sets nfc_dev->shutting_down to true and there
are no syscalls could restart the cmd_timeout timer."

kprobes: don't call disarm_kprobe() for disabled kprobes

The assumption in __disable_kprobe() is wrong, and it could try to disarm
an already disarmed kprobe and fire the WARN_ONCE() below. [0]  We can
easily reproduce this issue.

1. Write 0 to /sys/kernel/debug/kprobes/enabled.

  # echo 0 > /sys/kernel/debug/kprobes/enabled

2. Run execsnoop.  At this time, one kprobe is disabled.

  # /usr/share/bcc/tools/execsnoop &
  [1] 2460
  PCOMM            PID    PPID   RET ARGS

  # cat /sys/kernel/debug/kprobes/list
  ffffffff91345650  r  __x64_sys_execve+0x0    [FTRACE]
  ffffffff91345650  k  __x64_sys_execve+0x0    [DISABLED][FTRACE]

3. Write 1 to /sys/kernel/debug/kprobes/enabled, which changes
   kprobes_all_disarmed to false but does not arm the disabled kprobe.

  # echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/kprobes/enabled

  # cat /sys/kernel/debug/kprobes/list
  ffffffff91345650  r  __x64_sys_execve+0x0    [FTRACE]
  ffffffff91345650  k  __x64_sys_execve+0x0    [DISABLED][FTRACE]

4. Kill execsnoop, when __disable_kprobe() calls disarm_kprobe() for the
   disabled kprobe and hits the WARN_ONCE() in __disarm_kprobe_ftrace().

  # fg
  /usr/share/bcc/tools/execsnoop
  ^C

Actually, WARN_ONCE() is fired twice, and __unregister_kprobe_top() misses
some cleanups and leaves the aggregated kprobe in the hash table.  Then,
__unregister_trace_kprobe() initialises tk->rp.kp.list and creates an
infinite loop like this.

  aggregated kprobe.list -> kprobe.list -.
                                     ^    |
                                     '.__.'

In this situation, these commands fall into the infinite loop and result
in RCU stall or soft lockup.

  cat /sys/kernel/debug/kprobes/list : show_kprobe_addr() enters into the
                                       infinite loop with RCU.

  /usr/share/bcc/tools/execsnoop : warn_kprobe_rereg() holds kprobe_mutex,
                                   and __get_valid_kprobe() is stuck in
				   the loop.

To avoid the issue, make sure we don't call disarm_kprobe() for disabled
kprobes.

CVE-2022-50014	2025-06-18T11:15:29.470	2025-06-18T13:46:52.973	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/gup: fix FOLL_FORCE COW security issue and remove FOLL_COW

Ever since the Dirty COW (CVE-2016-5195) security issue happened, we know
that FOLL_FORCE can be possibly dangerous, especially if there are races
that can be exploited by user space.

Right now, it would be sufficient to have some code that sets a PTE of a
R/O-mapped shared page dirty, in order for it to erroneously become
writable by FOLL_FORCE.  The implications of setting a write-protected PTE
dirty might not be immediately obvious to everyone.

And in fact ever since commit 9ae0f87d009c (""mm/shmem: unconditionally set
pte dirty in mfill_atomic_install_pte""), we can use UFFDIO_CONTINUE to map
a shmem page R/O while marking the pte dirty.  This can be used by
unprivileged user space to modify tmpfs/shmem file content even if the
user does not have write permissions to the file, and to bypass memfd
write sealing -- Dirty COW restricted to tmpfs/shmem (CVE-2022-2590).

To fix such security issues for good, the insight is that we really only
need that fancy retry logic (FOLL_COW) for COW mappings that are not
writable (!VM_WRITE).  And in a COW mapping, we really only broke COW if
we have an exclusive anonymous page mapped.  If we have something else
mapped, or the mapped anonymous page might be shared (!PageAnonExclusive),
we have to trigger a write fault to break COW.  If we don't find an
exclusive anonymous page when we retry, we have to trigger COW breaking
once again because something intervened.

Let's move away from this mandatory-retry + dirty handling and rely on our
PageAnonExclusive() flag for making a similar decision, to use the same
COW logic as in other kernel parts here as well.  In case we stumble over
a PTE in a COW mapping that does not map an exclusive anonymous page, COW
was not properly broken and we have to trigger a fake write-fault to break
COW.

Just like we do in can_change_pte_writable() added via commit 64fe24a3e05e
(""mm/mprotect: try avoiding write faults for exclusive anonymous pages
when changing protection"") and commit 76aefad628aa (""mm/mprotect: fix
soft-dirty check in can_change_pte_writable()""), take care of softdirty
and uffd-wp manually.

For example, a write() via /proc/self/mem to a uffd-wp-protected range has
to fail instead of silently granting write access and bypassing the
userspace fault handler.  Note that FOLL_FORCE is not only used for debug
access, but also triggered by applications without debug intentions, for
example, when pinning pages via RDMA.

This fixes CVE-2022-2590. Note that only x86_64 and aarch64 are
affected, because only those support CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_USERFAULTFD_MINOR.

Fortunately, FOLL_COW is no longer required to handle FOLL_FORCE. So
let's just get rid of it.

Thanks to Nadav Amit for pointing out that the pte_dirty() check in
FOLL_FORCE code is problematic and might be exploitable.

Note 1: We don't check for the PTE being dirty because it doesn't matter
	for making a ""was COWed"" decision anymore, and whoever modifies the
	page has to set the page dirty either way.

Note 2: Kernels before extended uffd-wp support and before
	PageAnonExclusive (< 5.19) can simply revert the problematic
	commit instead and be safe regarding UFFDIO_CONTINUE. A backport to
	v5.19 requires minor adjustments due to lack of
	vma_soft_dirty_enabled()."

This is because pcibios_alloc_controller() holds hose_spinlock but

The hose_spinlock protects the phb_bitmap, and also the hose_list, but
it doesn't need to be held while get_phb_number() calls the OF routines,
because those are only looking up information in the device tree.

So fix it by having get_phb_number() take the hose_spinlock itself, only
where required, and then dropping the lock before returning.
pcibios_alloc_controller() then needs to take the lock again before the
list_add() but that's safe, the order of the list is not important."

CVE-2022-50063	2025-06-18T11:15:35.047	2025-06-18T13:47:40.833	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: felix: suppress non-changes to the tagging protocol

The way in which dsa_tree_change_tag_proto() works is that when
dsa_tree_notify() fails, it doesn't know whether the operation failed
mid way in a multi-switch tree, or it failed for a single-switch tree.
So even though drivers need to fail cleanly in
ds->ops->change_tag_protocol(), DSA will still call dsa_tree_notify()
again, to restore the old tag protocol for potential switches in the
tree where the change did succeeed (before failing for others).

This means for the felix driver that if we report an error in
felix_change_tag_protocol(), we'll get another call where proto_ops ==
old_proto_ops. If we proceed to act upon that, we may do unexpected
things. For example, we will call dsa_tag_8021q_register() twice in a
row, without any dsa_tag_8021q_unregister() in between. Then we will
actually call dsa_tag_8021q_unregister() via old_proto_ops->teardown,
which (if it manages to run at all, after walking through corrupted data
structures) will leave the ports inoperational anyway.

The bug can be readily reproduced if we force an error while in
tag_8021q mode; this crashes the kernel.

index out of range error.
Also fixed this kind of coding style in other for loop.

CVE-2022-50067	2025-06-18T11:15:35.490	2025-06-18T13:47:40.833	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: unset reloc control if transaction commit fails in prepare_to_relocate()

In btrfs_relocate_block_group(), the rc is allocated.  Then
btrfs_relocate_block_group() calls

relocate_block_group()
  prepare_to_relocate()
    set_reloc_control()

that assigns rc to the variable fs_info->reloc_ctl. When
prepare_to_relocate() returns, it calls

btrfs_commit_transaction()
  btrfs_start_dirty_block_groups()
    btrfs_alloc_path()
      kmem_cache_zalloc()

which may fail for example (or other errors could happen). When the
failure occurs, btrfs_relocate_block_group() detects the error and frees
rc and doesn't set fs_info->reloc_ctl to NULL. After that, in
btrfs_init_reloc_root(), rc is retrieved from fs_info->reloc_ctl and
then used, which may cause a use-after-free bug.

This possible bug can be triggered by calling btrfs_ioctl_balance()
before calling btrfs_ioctl_defrag().

To fix this possible bug, in prepare_to_relocate(), check if
btrfs_commit_transaction() fails. If the failure occurs,
unset_reloc_control() is called to set fs_info->reloc_ctl to NULL.

The error log in our fault-injection testing is shown as follows:

CVE-2022-50069	2025-06-18T11:15:35.733	2025-06-18T13:47:40.833	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

BPF: Fix potential bad pointer dereference in bpf_sys_bpf()

The bpf_sys_bpf() helper function allows an eBPF program to load another
eBPF program from within the kernel. In this case the argument union
bpf_attr pointer (as well as the insns and license pointers inside) is a
kernel address instead of a userspace address (which is the case of a
usual bpf() syscall). To make the memory copying process in the syscall
work in both cases, bpfptr_t was introduced to wrap around the pointer
and distinguish its origin. Specifically, when copying memory contents
from a bpfptr_t, a copy_from_user() is performed in case of a userspace
address and a memcpy() is performed for a kernel address.

This can lead to problems because the in-kernel pointer is never checked
for validity. The problem happens when an eBPF syscall program tries to
call bpf_sys_bpf() to load a program but provides a bad insns pointer --
say 0xdeadbeef -- in the bpf_attr union. The helper calls __sys_bpf()
which would then call bpf_prog_load() to load the program.
bpf_prog_load() is responsible for copying the eBPF instructions to the
newly allocated memory for the program; it creates a kernel bpfptr_t for
insns and invokes copy_from_bpfptr(). Internally, all bpfptr_t
operations are backed by the corresponding sockptr_t operations, which
performs direct memcpy() on kernel pointers for copy_from/strncpy_from
operations. Therefore, the code is always happy to dereference the bad
pointer to trigger a un-handle-able page fault and in turn an oops.
However, this is not supposed to happen because at that point the eBPF
program is already verified and should not cause a memory error.

The root cause of the problem is that an mptcp-level (re)transmit can
race with mptcp_close() and the packet scheduler checks the subflow
state before acquiring the socket lock: we can try to (re)transmit on
an already closed ssk.

Fix the issue checking again the subflow socket status under the
subflow socket lock protection. Additionally add the missing check
for the fallback-to-tcp case."

mptcp: move subflow cleanup in mptcp_destroy_common()

If the mptcp socket creation fails due to a CGROUP_INET_SOCK_CREATE

the related cleanup happens in __mptcp_destroy_sock() that is not
invoked in such code path.

Address the issue moving the subflow sockets cleanup in the
mptcp_destroy_common() helper, which is invoked in every msk cleanup
path.

net: tap: NULL pointer derefence in dev_parse_header_protocol when skb->dev is null

Fixes a NULL pointer derefence bug triggered from tap driver.
When tap_get_user calls virtio_net_hdr_to_skb the skb->dev is null
(in tap.c skb->dev is set after the call to virtio_net_hdr_to_skb)
virtio_net_hdr_to_skb calls dev_parse_header_protocol which
needs skb->dev field to be valid.

The line that trigers the bug is in dev_parse_header_protocol
(dev is at offset 0x10 from skb and is stored in RAX register)
  if (!dev->header_ops || !dev->header_ops->parse_protocol)
  22e1:   mov    0x10(%rbx),%rax
  22e5:	  mov    0x230(%rax),%rax

The warning is caused by reading conf->max_nr_stripes in raid_status. The
code in raid_status reads mddev->private, casts it to struct r5conf and
reads the entry max_nr_stripes.

However, if we have different raid type than 4/5/6, mddev->private
doesn't point to struct r5conf; it may point to struct r0conf, struct
r1conf, struct r10conf or struct mpconf. If we cast a pointer to one
of these structs to struct r5conf, we will be reading invalid memory
and KASAN warns about it.

Fix this bug by reading struct r5conf only if raid type is 4, 5 or 6."

block: don't allow the same type rq_qos add more than once

In our test of iocost, we encountered some list add/del corruptions of
inner_walk list in ioc_timer_fn.

The reason can be described as follows:

cpu 0					cpu 1
ioc_qos_write				ioc_qos_write

ioc = q_to_ioc(queue);
if (!ioc) {
        ioc = kzalloc();
					ioc = q_to_ioc(queue);
					if (!ioc) {
						ioc = kzalloc();
						...
						rq_qos_add(q, rqos);
					}
        ...
        rq_qos_add(q, rqos);
        ...
}

When the io.cost.qos file is written by two cpus concurrently, rq_qos may
be added to one disk twice. In that case, there will be two iocs enabled
and running on one disk. They own different iocgs on their active list. In
the ioc_timer_fn function, because of the iocgs from two iocs have the
same root iocg, the root iocg's walk_list may be overwritten by each other
and this leads to list add/del corruptions in building or destroying the
inner_walk list.

And so far, the blk-rq-qos framework works in case that one instance for
one type rq_qos per queue by default. This patch make this explicit and
also fix the crash above."

While we debug the issue, we found running fstests generic/551 on 5GB
non-zoned null_blk device in the emulated zoned mode also had a
similar hung issue.

Also, we can reproduce the same symptom with an error injected
cow_file_range() setup.

The hang occurs when cow_file_range() fails in the middle of
allocation. cow_file_range() called from do_allocation_zoned() can
split the give region ([start, end]) for allocation depending on
current block group usages. When btrfs can allocate bytes for one part
of the split regions but fails for the other region (e.g. because of
-ENOSPC), we return the error leaving the pages in the succeeded regions
locked. Technically, this occurs only when @unlock == 0. Otherwise, we
unlock the pages in an allocated region after creating an ordered
extent.

Considering the callers of cow_file_range(unlock=0) won't write out
the pages, we can unlock the pages on error exit from
cow_file_range(). So, we can ensure all the pages except @locked_page
are unlocked on error case.

In summary, cow_file_range now behaves like this:

- page_started == 1 (return value)
  - All the pages are unlocked. IO is started.
- unlock == 1
  - All the pages except @locked_page are unlocked in any case
- unlock == 0
  - On success, all the pages are locked for writing out them
  - On failure, all the pages except @locked_page are unlocked"					
CVE-2022-50090	2025-06-18T11:15:38.153	2025-06-18T13:47:40.833	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: replace BTRFS_MAX_EXTENT_SIZE with fs_info->max_extent_size

On zoned filesystem, data write out is limited by max_zone_append_size,
and a large ordered extent is split according the size of a bio. OTOH,
the number of extents to be written is calculated using
BTRFS_MAX_EXTENT_SIZE, and that estimated number is used to reserve the
metadata bytes to update and/or create the metadata items.

The metadata reservation is done at e.g, btrfs_buffered_write() and then
released according to the estimation changes. Thus, if the number of extent
increases massively, the reserved metadata can run out.

The increase of the number of extents easily occurs on zoned filesystem
if BTRFS_MAX_EXTENT_SIZE > max_zone_append_size. And, it causes the
following warning on a small RAM environment with disabling metadata
over-commit (in the following patch).

The csdlock_debug kernel-boot parameter is parsed by the

With CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP=n, __nr_to_section is called in

This is also a problem for powerpc because early_param() functions

static_key_enable() failures.  These failures cause the warning ""static

after converting the type of the first argument (@nr, bit number)
of arch_test_bit() from `long` to `unsigned long`[0].

Under certain conditions (for example, when ACPI NUMA is disabled
via command line), pxm_to_node() can return %NUMA_NO_NODE (-1).
It is valid 'magic' number of NUMA node, but not valid bit number
to use in bitops.
node_online() eventually descends to test_bit() without checking
for the input, assuming it's on caller side (which might be good
for perf-critical tasks). There, -1 becomes %ULONG_MAX which leads
to an insane array index when calculating bit position in memory.

For now, add an explicit check for @node being not %NUMA_NO_NODE
before calling test_bit(). The actual logics didn't change here
at all.

posix-cpu-timers: Cleanup CPU timers before freeing them during exec

Commit 55e8c8eb2c7b (""posix-cpu-timers: Store a reference to a pid not a
task"") started looking up tasks by PID when deleting a CPU timer.

When a non-leader thread calls execve, it will switch PIDs with the leader
process. Then, as it calls exit_itimers, posix_cpu_timer_del cannot find
the task because the timer still points out to the old PID.

That means that armed timers won't be disarmed, that is, they won't be
removed from the timerqueue_list. exit_itimers will still release their
memory, and when that list is later processed, it leads to a
use-after-free.

Clean up the timers from the de-threaded task before freeing them. This
prevents a reported use-after-free."

Commit c6e7bd7afaeb (""sched/core: Optimize ttwu() spinning on p->on_cpu"")
optimises ttwu by queueing a task that is descheduling on the wakelist,
but does not check if the task descheduling is still allowed to run on that CPU.

In this warning, the problematic task is a workqueue rescue thread which
checks if the rescue is for a per-cpu workqueue and running on the wrong CPU.
While this is early in boot and it should be possible to create workers,
the rescue thread may still used if the MAYDAY_INITIAL_TIMEOUT is reached
or MAYDAY_INTERVAL and on a sufficiently large machine, the rescue
thread is being used frequently.

Tracing confirmed that the task should have migrated properly using the
stopper thread to handle the migration. However, a parallel wakeup from udev
running on another CPU that does not share CPU cache observes p->on_cpu and
uses task_cpu(p), queues the task on the old CPU and triggers the warning.

Check that the wakee task that is descheduling is still allowed to run
on its current CPU and if not, wait for the descheduling to complete
and select an allowed CPU."

sched, cpuset: Fix dl_cpu_busy() panic due to empty cs->cpus_allowed

With cgroup v2, the cpuset's cpus_allowed mask can be empty indicating

cpuset_can_attach() can call task_can_attach() with an empty mask.
This can lead to cpumask_any_and() returns nr_cpu_ids causing the call

Also update task_can_attach()'s 2nd argument name to cs_effective_cpus to

tty: n_gsm: fix deadlock and link starvation in outgoing data path

The current implementation queues up new control and user packets as needed
and processes this queue down to the ldisc in the same code path.
That means that the upper and the lower layer are hard coupled in the code.
Due to this deadlocks can happen as seen below while transmitting data,
especially during ldisc congestion. Furthermore, the data channels starve
the control channel on high transmission load on the ldisc.

Introduce an additional control channel data queue to prevent timeouts and
link hangups during ldisc congestion. This is being processed before the
user channel data queue in gsm_data_kick(), i.e. with the highest priority.
Put the queue to ldisc data path into a workqueue and trigger it whenever
new data has been put into the transmission queue. Change
gsm_dlci_data_sweep() accordingly to fill up the transmission queue until
TX_THRESH_HI. This solves the locking issue, keeps latency low and provides
good performance on high data load.
Note that now all packets from a DLCI are removed from the internal queue
if the associated DLCI was closed. This ensures that no data is sent by the
introduced write task to an already closed DLCI.

CVE-2022-50117	2025-06-18T11:15:41.370	2025-06-18T13:47:40.833	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vfio: Split migration ops from main device ops

vfio core checks whether the driver sets some migration op (e.g.
set_state/get_state) and accordingly calls its op.

However, currently mlx5 driver sets the above ops without regards to its
migration caps.

This might lead to unexpected usage/Oops if user space may call to the
above ops even if the driver doesn't support migration. As for example,
the migration state_mutex is not initialized in that case.

The cleanest way to manage that seems to split the migration ops from
the main device ops, this will let the driver setting them separately
from the main ops when it's applicable.

As part of that, validate ops construction on registration and include a
check for VFIO_MIGRATION_STOP_COPY since the uAPI claims it must be set
in migration_flags.

HISI driver was changed as well to match this scheme.

This scheme may enable down the road to come with some extra group of
ops (e.g. DMA log) that can be set without regards to the other options
based on driver caps."

powerpc/perf: Optimize clearing the pending PMI and remove WARN_ON for PMI check in power_pmu_disable

commit 2c9ac51b850d (""powerpc/perf: Fix PMU callbacks to clear
pending PMI before resetting an overflown PMC"") added a new
function ""pmi_irq_pending"" in hw_irq.h. This function is to check
if there is a PMI marked as pending in Paca (PACA_IRQ_PMI).This is
used in power_pmu_disable in a WARN_ON. The intention here is to
provide a warning if there is PMI pending, but no counter is found
overflown.

This means that there is no PMC overflown among the active events
in the PMU, but there is a PMU pending in Paca. The function
""any_pmc_overflown"" checks the PMCs on active events in
cpuhw->n_events. Code snippet:

<<>>
if (any_pmc_overflown(cpuhw))
 	clear_pmi_irq_pending();
 else
 	WARN_ON(pmi_irq_pending());
<<>>

Here the PMC overflown is not from active event. Example: When we do
perf record, default cycles and instructions will be running on PMC6
and PMC5 respectively. It could happen that overflowed event is currently
not active and pending PMI is for the inactive event. Debug logs from
trace_printk:

<<>>
any_pmc_overflown: idx is 5: pmc value is 0xd9a
power_pmu_disable: PMC1: 0x0, PMC2: 0x0, PMC3: 0x0, PMC4: 0x0, PMC5: 0xd9a, PMC6: 0x80002011
<<>>

Here active PMC (from idx) is PMC5 , but overflown PMC is PMC6(0x80002011).
When we handle PMI interrupt for such cases, if the PMC overflown is
from inactive event, it will be ignored. Reference commit:
commit bc09c219b2e6 (""powerpc/perf: Fix finding overflowed PMC in interrupt"")

Patch addresses two changes:
1) Fix 1 : Removal of warning ( WARN_ON(pmi_irq_pending()); )
   We were printing warning if no PMC is found overflown among active PMU
   events, but PMI pending in PACA. But this could happen in cases where
   PMC overflown is not in active PMC. An inactive event could have caused
   the overflow. Hence the warning is not needed. To know pending PMI is
   from an inactive event, we need to loop through all PMC's which will
   cause more SPR reads via mfspr and increase in context switch. Also in
   existing function: perf_event_interrupt, already we ignore PMI's
   overflown when it is from an inactive PMC.

2) Fix 2: optimization in clearing pending PMI.
   Currently we check for any active PMC overflown before clearing PMI
   pending in Paca. This is causing additional SP

This was not detected earlier in Intel tests since the tests first
remove the parent PCI device and shut down the bus. The sequence
above is a corner case which keeps the bus operational but without a
driver bound.

While trying to solve this kernel oopses, it became clear that the
existing SoundWire bus does not deal well with the unbind case.

Commit 528be501b7d4a (""soundwire: sdw_slave: add probe_complete structure and new fields"")
added a 'probed' status variable and a 'probe_complete'
struct completion. This status is however not reset on remove and
likewise the 'probe complete' is not re-initialized, so the
bind/unbind/bind test cases would fail. The timeout used before the
'update_status' callback was also a bad idea in hindsight, there
should really be no timing assumption as to if and when a driver is
bound to a device.

An initial draft was based on device_lock() and device_unlock() was
tested. This proved too complicated, with deadlocks created during the
suspend-resume sequences, which also use the same device_lock/unlock()
as the bind/unbind sequences. On a CometLake device, a bad DSDT/BIOS
caused spurious resumes and the use of device_lock() caused hangs
during suspend. After multiple weeks or testing and painful
reverse-engineering of deadlocks on different devices, we looked for
alternatives that did not interfere with the device core.

A bus notifier was used successfully to keep track of DRIVER_BOUND and
DRIVER_UNBIND events. This solved the bind-unbind-bind case in tests,
but it can still be defeated with a theoretical corner case where the
memory is freed by a .remove while the callback is in use. The
notifier only helps make sure the driver callbacks are valid, but not
that the memory allocated in probe remains valid while the callbacks
are invoked.

This patch suggests the introduction of a new 'sdw_dev_lock' mutex
protecting probe/remove and all driver callbacks. Since this mutex is
'local' to SoundWire only, it does not interfere with existing locks
and does not create deadlocks. In addition, this patch removes the
'probe_complete' completion, instead we directly invoke the
'update_status' from the probe routine. That removes any sort of
timing dependency and a much better support for the device/driver
model, the driver could be bound before the bus started, or eons after
the bus started and the hardware would be properly initialized in all
cases.

This happens because of data race. Each thread rewrite channels's
descriptor as soon as device_prep_dma_memcpy() is called. It leads to the
situation when the driver thinks that it uses right descriptor that
actually is freed or substituted for other one.

With current fixes a descriptor changes its value only when it has
been used. A new descriptor is acquired from vc->desc_issued queue that
is already filled with descriptors that are ready to be sent. Threads
have no direct access to DMA channel descriptor. Now it is just possible

ax25: fix incorrect dev_tracker usage

While investigating a separate rose issue [1], and enabling
CONFIG_NET_DEV_REFCNT_TRACKER=y, Bernard reported an orthogonal ax25 issue [2]

An ax25_dev can be used by one (or many) struct ax25_cb.
We thus need different dev_tracker, one per struct ax25_cb.

After this patch is applied, we are able to focus on rose.

bpf, x86: fix freeing of not-finalized bpf_prog_pack

syzbot reported a few issues with bpf_prog_pack [1], [2]. This only happens
with multiple subprogs. In jit_subprogs(), we first call bpf_int_jit_compile()
on each sub program. And then, we call it on each sub program again. jit_data
is not freed in the first call of bpf_int_jit_compile(). Similarly we don't
call bpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize() in the first call of bpf_int_jit_compile().

If bpf_int_jit_compile() failed for one sub program, we will call
bpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize() for this sub program. However, we don't have a
chance to call it for other sub programs. Then we will hit ""goto out_free"" in
jit_subprogs(), and call bpf_jit_free on some subprograms that haven't got
bpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize() yet.

At this point, bpf_jit_binary_pack_free() is called and the whole 2MB page is
freed erroneously.

Fix this with a custom bpf_jit_free() for x86_64, which calls
bpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize() if necessary. Also, with custom
bpf_jit_free(), bpf_prog_aux->use_bpf_prog_pack is not needed any more,
remove it.

It first holds the spinlock bond->stats_lock, and then call
hinic_get_stats64() to collect hinic device's stats.
However, hinic_get_stats64() calls `down(&nic_dev->mgmt_lock)` to
protect its critical section, which may schedule current task out.
And if system is under high pressure, the task cannot be woken up
immediately, which eventually triggers kernel hung panic.

rcutorture: Fix ksoftirqd boosting timing and iteration

The RCU priority boosting can fail in two situations:

1) If (nr_cpus= > maxcpus=), which means if the total number of CPUs
is higher than those brought online at boot, then torture_onoff() may
later bring up CPUs that weren't online on boot. Now since rcutorture
initialization only boosts the ksoftirqds of the CPUs that have been
set online on boot, the CPUs later set online by torture_onoff won't
benefit from the boost, making RCU priority boosting fail.

2) The ksoftirqd kthreads are boosted after the creation of
rcu_torture_boost() kthreads, which opens a window large enough for these
rcu_torture_boost() kthreads to wait (despite running at FIFO priority)
for ksoftirqds that are still running at SCHED_NORMAL priority.

PM: hibernate: defer device probing when resuming from hibernation

syzbot is reporting hung task at misc_open() [1], for there is a race
window of AB-BA deadlock which involves probe_count variable. Currently
wait_for_device_probe() from snapshot_open() from misc_open() can sleep
forever with misc_mtx held if probe_count cannot become 0.

When a device is probed by hub_event() work function, probe_count is
incremented before the probe function starts, and probe_count is
decremented after the probe function completed.

There are three cases that can prevent probe_count from dropping to 0.

  (a) A device being probed stopped responding (i.e. broken/malicious
      hardware).

  (b) A process emulating a USB device using /dev/raw-gadget interface
      stopped responding for some reason.

  (c) New device probe requests keeps coming in before existing device
      probe requests complete.

The phenomenon syzbot is reporting is (b). A process which is holding
system_transition_mutex and misc_mtx is waiting for probe_count to become
0 inside wait_for_device_probe(), but the probe function which is called
 from hub_event() work function is waiting for the processes which are
blocked at mutex_lock(&misc_mtx) to respond via /dev/raw-gadget interface.

This patch mitigates (b) by deferring wait_for_device_probe() from
snapshot_open() to snapshot_write() and snapshot_ioctl(). Please note that
the possibility of (b) remains as long as any thread which is emulating a
USB device via /dev/raw-gadget interface can be blocked by uninterruptible
blocking operations (e.g. mutex_lock()).

Please also note that (a) and (c) are not addressed. Regarding (c), we
should change the code to wait for only one device which contains the
image for resuming from hibernation. I don't know how to address (a), for
use of timeout for wait_for_device_probe() might result in loss of user
data in the image. Maybe we should require the userland to wait for the
image device before opening /dev/snapshot interface."

coresight: Clear the connection field properly

coresight devices track their connections (output connections) and
hold a reference to the fwnode. When a device goes away, we walk through
the devices on the coresight bus and make sure that the references
are dropped. This happens both ways:
 a) For all output connections from the device, drop the reference to
    the target device via coresight_release_platform_data()

b) Iterate over all the devices on the coresight bus and drop the
   reference to fwnode if *this* device is the target of the output
   connection, via coresight_remove_conns()->coresight_remove_match().

However, the coresight_remove_match() doesn't clear the fwnode field,
after dropping the reference, this causes use-after-free and
additional refcount drops on the fwnode.

e.g., if we have two devices, A and B, with a connection, A -> B.
If we remove B first, B would clear the reference on B, from A
via coresight_remove_match(). But when A is removed, it still has
a connection with fwnode still pointing to B. Thus it tries to  drops
the reference in coresight_release_platform_data(), raising the bells
like :

When a SCSI device is removed while in active use, currently sg will
immediately return -ENODEV on any attempt to wait for active commands that
were sent before the removal.  This is problematic for commands that use
SG_FLAG_DIRECT_IO since the data buffer may still be in use by the kernel
when userspace frees or reuses it after getting ENODEV, leading to
corrupted userspace memory (in the case of READ-type commands) or corrupted
data being sent to the device (in the case of WRITE-type commands).  This
has been seen in practice when logging out of a iscsi_tcp session, where
the iSCSI driver may still be processing commands after the device has been
marked for removal.

Change the policy to allow userspace to wait for active sg commands even

bpf: Fix KASAN use-after-free Read in compute_effective_progs

Syzbot found a Use After Free bug in compute_effective_progs().
The reproducer creates a number of BPF links, and causes a fault
injected alloc to fail, while calling bpf_link_detach on them.
Link detach triggers the link to be freed by bpf_link_free(),
which calls __cgroup_bpf_detach() and update_effective_progs().
If the memory allocation in this function fails, the function restores
the pointer to the bpf_cgroup_link on the cgroup list, but the memory
gets freed just after it returns. After this, every subsequent call to
update_effective_progs() causes this already deallocated pointer to be
dereferenced in prog_list_length(), and triggers KASAN UAF error.

To fix this issue don't preserve the pointer to the prog or link in the
list, but remove it and replace it with a dummy prog without shrinking
the table. The subsequent call to __cgroup_bpf_detach() or
__cgroup_bpf_detach() will correct it."

usbnet: Fix linkwatch use-after-free on disconnect

usbnet uses the work usbnet_deferred_kevent() to perform tasks which may
sleep.  On disconnect, completion of the work was originally awaited in
->ndo_stop().  But in 2003, that was moved to ->disconnect() by historic
commit ""[PATCH] USB: usbnet, prevent exotic rtnl deadlock"":

  https://git.kernel.org/tglx/history/c/0f138bbfd83c

The change was made because back then, the kernel's workqueue
implementation did not allow waiting for a single work.  One had to wait
for completion of *all* work by calling flush_scheduled_work(), and that
could deadlock when waiting for usbnet_deferred_kevent() with rtnl_mutex
held in ->ndo_stop().

The commit solved one problem but created another:  It causes a
use-after-free in USB Ethernet drivers aqc111.c, asix_devices.c,
ax88179_178a.c, ch9200.c and smsc75xx.c:

* If the drivers receive a link change interrupt immediately before
  disconnect, they raise EVENT_LINK_RESET in their (non-sleepable)
  ->status() callback and schedule usbnet_deferred_kevent().
* usbnet_deferred_kevent() invokes the driver's ->link_reset() callback,
  which calls netif_carrier_{on,off}().
* That in turn schedules the work linkwatch_event().

Because usbnet_deferred_kevent() is awaited after unregister_netdev(),
netif_carrier_{on,off}() may operate on an unregistered netdev and
linkwatch_event() may run after free_netdev(), causing a use-after-free.

In 2010, usbnet was changed to only wait for a single instance of
usbnet_deferred_kevent() instead of *all* work by commit 23f333a2bfaf
(""drivers/net: don't use flush_scheduled_work()"").

Unfortunately the commit neglected to move the wait back to
->ndo_stop().  Rectify that omission at long last."

drm/fb-helper: Fix out-of-bounds access

Clip memory range to screen-buffer size to avoid out-of-bounds access
in fbdev deferred I/O's damage handling.

Fbdev's deferred I/O can only track pages. From the range of pages, the
damage handler computes the clipping rectangle for the display update.
If the fbdev screen buffer ends near the beginning of a page, that page
could contain more scanlines. The damage handler would then track these
non-existing scanlines as dirty and provoke an out-of-bounds access
during the screen update. Hence, clip the maximum memory range to the
size of the screen buffer.

While at it, rename the variables min/max to min_off/max_off in

The root cause of the bug sits in neon_poly1305_blocks. The logic
neon_poly1305_blocks() performed is that if it was called with both s[]
and r[] uninitialized, it will first try to initialize them with the
data from the first ""block"" that it believed to be 32 bytes in length.
First 16 bytes are used as the key and the next 16 bytes for s[]. This
would lead to the aforementioned read out-of-bound. However, after
calling poly1305_init_arch(), only 16 bytes were deducted from the input
and s[] is initialized yet again with the following 16 bytes. The second
initialization of s[] is certainly redundent which indicates that the
first initialization should be for r[] only.

This patch fixes the issue by calling poly1305_init_arm64() instead o

Versa Director accepts untrusted user input when dispatching 2FA codes, allowing an attacker who knows a valid username and password to redirect the OTP delivery (SMS/email) to their own device. OTP/TOTP codes are not invalidated after use, enabling reuse by an attacker who has previously intercepted or obtained a valid code. In addition, the 2FA system does not adequately restrict the number or frequency of login attempts. The OTP values are generated from a relatively small keyspace, making brute-force attacks more feasible.

CVE-2025-52464	2025-06-19T16:15:22.327	2025-10-09T16:52:14.950	Meshtastic is an open source mesh networking solution. In versions from 2.5.0 to before 2.6.11, the flashing procedure of several hardware vendors was resulting in duplicated public/private keys. Additionally, the Meshtastic was failing to properly initialize the internal randomness pool on some platforms, leading to possible low-entropy key generation. When users with an affected key pair sent Direct Messages, those message could be captured and decrypted by an attacker that has compiled the list of compromised keys. This issue has been patched in version 2.6.11 where key generation is delayed til the first time the LoRa region is set, along with warning users when a compromised key is detected. Version 2.6.12 furthers this patch by automatically wiping known compromised keys when found. A workaround to this vulnerability involves users doing a complete device wipe to remove vendor-cloned keys.	8.3	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L

CVE-2025-32875	2025-06-20T14:15:27.730	2025-06-23T20:16:40.143	An issue was discovered in the COROS application through 3.8.12 for Android. Bluetooth pairing and bonding is neither initiated nor enforced by the application itself. Also, the watch does not enforce pairing and bonding. As a result, any data transmitted via BLE remains unencrypted, allowing attackers within Bluetooth range to eavesdrop on the communication. Furthermore, even if a user manually initiates pairing and bonding in the Android settings, the application continues to transmit data without requiring the watch to be bonded. This fallback behavior enables attackers to exploit the communication, for example, by conducting an active machine-in-the-middle attack.	5.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2025-32876	2025-06-20T14:15:27.877	2025-07-08T14:32:59.510	An issue was discovered on COROS PACE 3 devices through 3.0808.0. The BLE implementation of the COROS smartwatch does not support LE Secure Connections and instead enforces BLE Legacy Pairing. In BLE Legacy Pairing, the Short-Term Key (STK) can be easily guessed. This requires knowledge of the Temporary Key (TK), which, in the case of the COROS Pace 3, is set to 0 due to the Just Works pairing method. An attacker within Bluetooth range can therefore perform sniffing attacks, allowing eavesdropping on the communication.	6.8	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2025-32877	2025-06-20T14:15:28.250	2025-07-08T14:32:52.860	An issue was discovered on COROS PACE 3 devices through 3.0808.0. It identifies itself as a device without input or output capabilities, which results in the use of the Just Works pairing method. This method does not implement any authentication, which therefore allows machine-in-the-middle attacks. Furthermore, this lack of authentication allows attackers to interact with the device via BLE without requiring prior authorization.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2025-32878	2025-06-20T14:15:28.490	2025-07-08T14:32:47.210	An issue was discovered on COROS PACE 3 devices through 3.0808.0. It implements a function to connect the watch to a WLAN. This function is mainly for downloading firmware files. Before downloading firmware files, the watch requests some information about the firmware via HTTPS from the back-end API. However, the X.509 server certificate within the TLS handshake is not validated by the device. This allows an attacker within an active machine-in-the-middle position, using a TLS proxy and a self-signed certificate, to eavesdrop and manipulate the HTTPS communication. This could be abused, for example, for stealing the API access token of the assigned user account.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2025-32879	2025-06-20T14:15:28.783	2025-07-08T14:32:41.563	An issue was discovered on COROS PACE 3 devices through 3.0808.0. It starts advertising if no device is connected via Bluetooth. This allows an attacker to connect with the device via BLE if no other device is connected. While connected, none of the BLE services and characteristics of the device require any authentication or security level. Therefore, any characteristic, depending on their mode of operation (read/write/notify), can be used by the connected attacker. This allows, for example, configuring the device, sending notifications, resetting the device to factory settings, or installing software.	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Due to a missing constraint in the rv32im circuit, any 3-register RISC-V instruction (including remu and divu) in risc0-zkvm 2.0.0, 2.0.1, and 2.0.2 are vulnerable to an attack by a malicious prover. The main idea for the attack is to confuse the RISC-V virtual machine into treating the value of the rs1 register as the same as the rs2 register due to a lack of constraints in the rv32im circuit. Rust applications using the risc0-zkvm crate at versions 2.0.0, 2.0.1, and 2.0.2 should upgrade to version 2.1.0. Smart contract applications using the official RISC Zero Verifier Router do not need to take any action: zkVM version 2.1 is active on all official routers, and version 2.0 has been disabled. Smart contract applications not using the verifier router should update their contracts to send verification calls to the 2.1 version of the verifier.

CVE-2025-52556	2025-06-21T02:15:19.947	2025-06-23T20:16:21.633	rfc3161-client is a Python library implementing the Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP) described in RFC 3161. Prior to version 1.0.3, there is a flaw in the timestamp response signature verification logic. In particular, chain verification is performed against the TSR's embedded certificates up to the trusted root(s), but fails to verify the TSR's own signature against the timestamping leaf certificates. Consequently, vulnerable versions perform insufficient signature validation to properly consider a TSR verified, as the attacker can introduce any TSR signature so long as the embedded leaf chains up to some root TSA. This issue has been patched in version 1.0.3. There is no workaround for this issue.

Anyone can create a customer account and easily exploit these. Successful exploitation results in disclosure of the PII of other customers and the deletion of their reviews of products on the website. To be specific, an attacker could view the order details of any order by browsing to /en/account/orders/_ORDER_ID_ or use the address and billing information of other customers by manipulating the shipping_address_id and billing_address_id parameters when making an order (this information is then reflected in the receipt).

This bypasses the initial check that uploaded files are image files. The application relies on frontend checks to restrict the administrator from changing the extension of uploaded files to .php. This restriction is easily bypassed with any proxy tool (e.g., BurpSuite). Once the attacker renames the file, and gives it the .php extension, a GET request can be used to trigger the execution of code on the server.	9.9	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L

CVE-2025-52471	2025-06-24T20:15:26.033	2025-06-26T18:58:14.280	ESF-IDF is the Espressif Internet of Things (IOT) Development Framework. An integer underflow vulnerability has been identified in the ESP-NOW protocol implementation within the ESP Wi-Fi component of versions 5.4.1, 5.3.3, 5.2.5, and 5.1.6 of the ESP-IDF framework. This issue stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied data length in the packet receive function. Under certain conditions, this may lead to out-of-bounds memory access and may allow arbitrary memory write operations. On systems without a memory protection scheme, this behavior could potentially be used to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the target device. In versions 5.4.2, 5.3.4, 5.2.6, and 5.1.6, ESP-NOW has added more comprehensive validation logic on user-supplied data length during packet reception to prevent integer underflow caused by negative value calculations. For ESP-IDF v5.3 and earlier, a workaround can be applied by validating that the `data_len` parameter received in the RX callback (registered via `esp_now_register_recv_cb()`) is a positive value before further processing. For ESP-IDF v5.4 and later, no application-level workaround is available. Users are advised to upgrade to a patched version of ESP-IDF to take advantage of the built-in mitigation.

CVE-2025-52880	2025-06-24T20:15:26.373	2025-06-26T18:58:14.280	Komga is a media server for comics, mangas, BDs, magazines and eBooks. A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been discovered in versions 1.8.0 through 1.21.3 when serving EPUB resources, either directly from the API, or when reading using the epub reader. The vulnerability lets an attacker perform actions on the victim's behalf. When targeting an admin user, this can be combined with controlling a server-side command to achieve arbitrary code execution. For this vulnerability to be exploited, a malicious EPUB file has to be present in a Komga library, and subsequently accessed in the Epub reader by an admin user. Version 1.22.0 contains a patch for the issue.	4.2	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2025-52882	2025-06-24T20:15:26.543	2025-06-26T18:58:14.280	Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. Claude Code extensions in VSCode and forks (e.g., Cursor, Windsurf, and VSCodium) and JetBrains IDEs (e.g., IntelliJ, Pycharm, and Android Studio) are vulnerable to unauthorized websocket connections from an attacker when visiting attacker-controlled webpages. Claude Code for VSCode IDE extensions versions 0.2.116 through 1.0.23 are vulnerable. For Jetbrains IDE plugins, Claude Code [beta] versions 0.1.1 through 0.1.8 are vulnerable. In VSCode (and forks), exploitation would allow an attacker to read arbitrary files, see the list of files open in the IDE, get selection and diagnostics events from the IDE, or execute code in limited situations where a user has an open Jupyter Notebook and accepts a malicious prompt. In JetBrains IDEs, an attacker could get selection events, a list of open files, and a list of syntax errors. Claude released a patch for this issue on June 13th, 2025. Although Claude Code auto-updates when a user launch it and auto-updates the extensions, users should take the following steps, though the exact steps depend on one's integrated development environment (IDE). For VSCode, Cursor, Windsurf, VSCodium, and other VSCode forks, check the extension Claude Code for VSCode. Open the list of Extensions (View->Extensions), look for Claude Code for VSCode among installed extensions, update or uninstall any version prior to 1.0.24, and restart the IDE. For JetBrains IDEs including IntelliJ, PyCharm, and Android Studio, check the plugin Claude Code [Beta]. Open the Plugins list, look for Claude Code [Beta] among installed extensions, update or uninstall any version prior to 0.1.9, and restart the IDE.

CVE-2025-52883	2025-06-24T21:15:26.030	2025-06-26T18:58:14.280	Meshtastic-Android is an Android application for the mesh radio software Meshtastic. Prior to version 2.5.21, an attacker is able to send an unencrypted direct message to a victim impersonating any other node of the mesh. This message will be displayed in the same chat that the victim normally communicates with the other node and it will appear as using PKC, while it is not. This means that the victim will be provided with a false sense of security due to the green padlock displayed when using PKC and they'll read the attacker's message as legitimate. Version 2.5.21 contains a patch for the issue. It is suggested to implement a stricter control on whether a message has been received using PKC or using the shared Meshtastic channel key. Moreover, instead of showing no green padlock icon in the chat with no PKC, consider using an explicit indicator like, for example, the yellow half-open padlock displayed when in HAM mode. This remediation, however, applies to the client applications rather than the Meshtastic firmware.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N		
CVE-2025-52884	2025-06-24T21:15:26.207	2025-06-26T18:58:14.280	RISC Zero is a zero-knowledge verifiable general computing platform, with Ethereum integration. The risc0-ethereum repository contains Solidity verifier contracts, Steel EVM view call library, and supporting code. Prior to versions 2.1.1 and 2.2.0, the `Steel.validateCommitment` Solidity library function will return `true` for a crafted commitment with a digest value of zero. This violates the semantics of `validateCommitment`, as this does not commitment to a block that is in the current chain. Because the digest is zero, it does not correspond to any block and there exist no known openings. As a result, this commitment will never be produced by a correct zkVM guest using Steel and leveraging this bug to compromise the soundness of a program using Steel would require a separate bug or misuse of the Steel library, which is expected to be used to validate the root of state opening proofs. A fix has been released as part of `risc0-ethereum` 2.1.1 and 2.2.0. Users for the `Steel` Solidity library versions 2.1.0 or earlier should ensure they are using `Steel.validateCommitment` in tandem with zkVM proof verification of a Steel program, as shown in the ERC-20 counter example, and documentation. This is the correct usage of Steel, and users following this pattern are not at risk, and do not need to take action. Users not verifying a zkVM proof of a Steel program should update their application to do so, as this is incorrect usage of Steel.

CVE-2025-52576	2025-06-25T17:15:39.023	2025-08-22T18:23:53.877	Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. Prior to version 1.2.46, Kanboard is vulnerable to username enumeration and IP spoofing-based brute-force protection bypass. By analyzing login behavior and abusing trusted HTTP headers, an attacker can determine valid usernames and circumvent rate-limiting or blocking mechanisms. Any organization running a publicly accessible Kanboard instance is affected, especially if relying on IP-based protections like Fail2Ban or CAPTCHA for login rate-limiting. Attackers with access to the login page can exploit this flaw to enumerate valid usernames and bypass IP-based blocking mechanisms, putting all user accounts at higher risk of brute-force or credential stuffing attacks. Version 1.2.46 contains a patch for the issue.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2025-52889	2025-06-25T17:15:39.200	2025-06-26T18:57:43.670	Incus is a system container and virtual machine manager. When using an ACL on a device connected to a bridge, Incus version 6.12 and 6.13 generates nftables rules for local services (DHCP, DNS...) that partially bypass security options `security.mac_filtering`, `security.ipv4_filtering` and `security.ipv6_filtering`. This can lead to DHCP pool exhaustion and opens the door for other attacks. A patch is available at commit 2516fb19ad8428454cb4edfe70c0a5f0dc1da214.	3.4	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L

OpenBao before v2.3.0 allowed an attacker to perform unauthenticated, unaudited cancellation of root rekey and recovery rekey operations, effecting a denial of service. In OpenBao v2.2.0 and later, manually setting the configuration option `disable_unauthed_rekey_endpoints=true` allows an operator to deny these rarely-used endpoints on global listeners. A patch is available at commit fe75468822a22a88318c6079425357a02ae5b77b. In a future OpenBao release communicated on OpenBao's website, the maintainers will set this to `true` for all users and provide an authenticated alternative. As a workaround, if an active proxy or load balancer sits in front of OpenBao, an operator can deny requests to these endpoints from unauthorized IP ranges.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Versions prior to 1.3.3 are written in a way that is vulnerable to command injection vulnerability attacks as part of some of its MCP Server tool definition and implementation. The MCP Server exposes the tool `ui_tap` which relies on Node.js child process API `exec` which is an unsafe and vulnerable API if concatenated with untrusted user input. LLM exposed user input for `duration`, `udid`, and `x` and `y` args can be replaced with shell meta-characters like `;` or `&&` or others to change the behavior from running the expected command `idb` to another command. When LLMs are tricked through prompt injection (and other techniques and attack vectors) to call the tool with input that uses special shell characters such as `; rm -rf /tmp;#` and other payload variations, the full command-line text will be interepted by the shell and result in other commands except of `ps` executing on the host running the MCP Server.

Versions prior to 3.3.0-RC1 and 3.2.1 contain a HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability. The `sendHeader` function takes arbitrary input for the HTTP header name and value, concatenates them into an HTTP header line, and appends this to the outgoing HTTP response headers. There is no validation or sanitization of the `name` or `value` parameters before they are included in the HTTP response. If an attacker can control the input to `sendHeader` (either directly or indirectly), they could inject carriage return (`\r`) or line feed (`\n`) characters into either the header name or value. This could allow the attacker to inject additional headers, manipulate the structure of the HTTP response, potentially inject an entire new HTTP response (HTTP Response Splitting), and/or ause header confusion or other HTTP protocol attacks.

A vulnerability present in versions 0.9.10 through 0.9.16 allows a user to authenticate to a Linux host via Himmelblau using an *invalid* Linux Hello PIN, provided the host is offline. While the user gains access to the local system, Single Sign-On (SSO) fails due to the network being down and the inability to issue tokens (due to a failure to unlock the Hello key). The core issue lies in an incorrect assumption within the `acquire_token_by_hello_for_business_key` function: it was expected to return a `TPMFail` error for an invalid Hello key when offline, but instead, a preceding nonce request resulted in a `RequestFailed` error, leading the system to erroneously transition to an offline success state without validating the Hello key unlock. This impacts systems using Himmelblau for authentication when operating in an offline state with Hello PIN authentication enabled. Rocky Linux 8 (and variants) are not affected by this vulnerability. The problem is resolved in Himmelblau version 0.9.17. A workaround is available for users who cannot immediately upgrade. Disabling Hello PIN authentication by setting `enable_hello = false` in `/etc/himmelblau/himmelblau.conf` will mitigate the vulnerability.	5.2	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2025-52903	2025-06-26T19:15:21.587	2025-08-05T18:23:52.067	File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. In version 2.32.0, the Command Execution feature of File Browser only allows the execution of shell command which have been predefined on a user-specific allowlist. Many tools allow the execution of arbitrary different commands, rendering this limitation void. The concrete impact depends on the commands being granted to the attacker, but the large number of standard commands allowing the execution of subcommands makes it likely that every user having the `Execute commands` permissions can exploit this vulnerability. Everyone who can exploit it will have full code execution rights with the uid of the server process. Until this issue is fixed, the maintainers recommend to completely disable `Execute commands` for all accounts. Since the command execution is an inherently dangerous feature that is not used by all deployments, it should be possible to completely disable it in the application's configuration. As a defense-in-depth measure, organizations not requiring command execution should operate the Filebrowser from a distroless container image. A patch version has been pushed to disable the feature for all existent installations, and making it opt-in.

A warning has been added to the documentation and is printed on the console if the feature is enabled. Due to the project being in maintenance-only mode, the bug has not been fixed. Fix is tracked on pull request 5199.	8.0	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2025-49592	2025-06-26T20:15:29.323	2025-09-02T17:52:02.590	n8n is a workflow automation platform. Versions prior to 1.98.0 have an Open Redirect vulnerability in the login flow. Authenticated users can be redirected to untrusted, attacker-controlled domains after logging in, by crafting malicious URLs with a misleading redirect query parameter. This may lead to phishing attacks by impersonating the n8n UI on lookalike domains (e.g., n8n.local.evil.com), credential or 2FA theft if users are tricked into re-entering sensitive information, and/or reputation risk due to the visual similarity between attacker-controlled domains and trusted ones. The vulnerability affects anyone hosting n8n and exposing the `/signin` endpoint to users. The issue has been patched in version 1.98.0. All users should upgrade to this version or later. The fix introduces strict origin validation for redirect URLs, ensuring only same-origin or relative paths are allowed after login.	4.6	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

CVE-2025-53018	2025-06-27T13:15:24.803	2025-06-30T18:38:48.477	Lychee is a free, open-source photo-management tool. Prior to version 6.6.13, a critical Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the `/api/v2/Photo::fromUrl` endpoint. This flaw lets an attacker instruct the application’s backend to make HTTP requests to any URL they choose. Consequently, internal network resources—such as localhost services or cloud-provider metadata endpoints—become reachable. The endpoint takes a URL from the user and calls it server-side via fopen() without any safeguards. There is no IP address validation, nor are there any allow-list, timeout, or size restrictions. Because of this, attackers can point the application at internal targets. Using this flaw, an attacker can perform internal port scans or retrieve sensitive cloud metadata. Version 6.6.13 contains a patch for the issue.	3.0	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N

CVE-2025-53097	2025-06-27T22:15:25.803	2025-09-15T13:47:38.837	Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent. Prior to version 3.20.3, there was an issue where the Roo Code agent's `search_files` tool did not respect the setting to disable reads outside of the VS Code workspace. This means that an attacker who was able to inject a prompt into the agent could potentially read a sensitive file and then write the information to a JSON schema. Users have the option to disable schema fetching in VS Code, but the feature is enabled by default. For users with this feature enabled, writing to the schema would trigger a network request without the user having a chance to deny. This issue is of moderate severity, since it requires the attacker to already be able to submit prompts to the agent. Version 3.20.3 fixed the issue where `search_files` did not respect the setting to limit it to the workspace. This reduces the scope of the damage if an attacker is able to take control of the agent through prompt injection or another vector.	5.9	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

The project-specific MCP configuration for the Roo Code agent is stored in the `.roo/mcp.json` file within the VS Code workspace. Because the MCP configuration format allows for execution of arbitrary commands, prior to version 3.20.3, it would have been possible for an attacker with access to craft a prompt to ask the agent to write a malicious command to the MCP configuration file. If the user had opted-in to auto-approving file writes within the project, this would have led to arbitrary command execution. This issue is of moderate severity, since it requires the attacker to already be able to submit prompts to the agent (for instance through a prompt injection attack), for the user to have MCP enabled (on by default), and for the user to have enabled auto-approved file writes (off by default). Version 3.20.3 fixes the issue by adding an additional layer of opt-in configuration for auto-approving writing to Roo's configuration files, including all files within the `.roo/` folder.	8.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2025-38084	2025-06-28T08:15:23.970	2025-07-30T06:15:26.867	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/hugetlb: unshare page tables during VMA split, not before

Currently, __split_vma() triggers hugetlb page table unsharing through
vm_ops->may_split().  This happens before the VMA lock and rmap locks are
taken - which is too early, it allows racing VMA-locked page faults in our
process and racing rmap walks from other processes to cause page tables to
be shared again before we actually perform the split.

Fix it by explicitly calling into the hugetlb unshare logic from
__split_vma() in the same place where THP splitting also happens.  At that
point, both the VMA and the rmap(s) are write-locked.

An annoying detail is that we can now call into the helper
hugetlb_unshare_pmds() from two different locking contexts:

1. from hugetlb_split(), holding:
    - mmap lock (exclusively)
    - VMA lock
    - file rmap lock (exclusively)
2. hugetlb_unshare_all_pmds(), which I think is designed to be able to
   call us with only the mmap lock held (in shared mode), but currently
   only runs while holding mmap lock (exclusively) and VMA lock

Backporting note:
This commit fixes a racy protection that was introduced in commit
b30c14cd6102 (""hugetlb: unshare some PMDs when splitting VMAs""); that
commit claimed to fix an issue introduced in 5.13, but it should actually
also go all the way back.

huge_pmd_unshare() drops a reference on a page table that may have
previously been shared across processes, potentially turning it into a
normal page table used in another process in which unrelated VMAs can
afterwards be installed.

If this happens in the middle of a concurrent gup_fast(), gup_fast() could
end up walking the page tables of another process.  While I don't see any
way in which that immediately leads to kernel memory corruption, it is
really weird and unexpected.

net: ch9200: fix uninitialised access during mii_nway_restart

In mii_nway_restart() the code attempts to call
mii->mdio_read which is ch9200_mdio_read(). ch9200_mdio_read()
utilises a local buffer called ""buff"", which is initialised
with control_read(). However ""buff"" is conditionally
initialised inside control_read():

        if (err == size) {
                memcpy(data, buf, size);

If the condition of ""err == size"" is not met, then
""buff"" remains uninitialised. Once this happens the
uninitialised ""buff"" is accessed and returned during
ch9200_mdio_read():

        return (buff[0] | buff[1] << 8);

The problem stems from the fact that ch9200_mdio_read()
ignores the return value of control_read(), leading to
uinit-access of ""buff"".

To fix this we should check the return value of
control_read() and return early on error."

sunrpc: handle SVC_GARBAGE during svc auth processing as auth error

tianshuo han reported a remotely-triggerable crash if the client sends a
kernel RPC server a specially crafted packet. If decoding the RPC reply
fails in such a way that SVC_GARBAGE is returned without setting the
rq_accept_statp pointer, then that pointer can be dereferenced and a
value stored there.

If it's the first time the thread has processed an RPC, then that
pointer will be set to NULL and the kernel will crash. In other cases,
it could create a memory scribble.

The server sunrpc code treats a SVC_GARBAGE return from svc_authenticate
or pg_authenticate as if it should send a GARBAGE_ARGS reply. RFC 5531
says that if authentication fails that the RPC should be rejected
instead with a status of AUTH_ERR.

Handle a SVC_GARBAGE return as an AUTH_ERROR, with a reason of
AUTH_BADCRED instead of returning GARBAGE_ARGS in that case. This
sidesteps the whole problem of touching the rpc_accept_statp pointer in
this situation and avoids the crash."
