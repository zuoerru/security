usb: misc: ljca: Fix double free in error handling path

When auxiliary_device_add() returns error and then calls
auxiliary_device_uninit(), callback function ljca_auxdev_release
calls kfree(auxdev->dev.platform_data) to free the parameter data
of the function ljca_new_client_device. The callers of
ljca_new_client_device shouldn't call kfree() again
in the error handling path to free the platform data.

Fix this by cleaning up the redundant kfree() in all callers and
adding kfree() the passed in platform_data on errors which happen
before auxiliary_device_init() succeeds ."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2024-26654	2024-04-01T09:15:51.063	2025-02-03T14:32:27.763	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: sh: aica: reorder cleanup operations to avoid UAF bugs

The dreamcastcard->timer could schedule the spu_dma_work and the
spu_dma_work could also arm the dreamcastcard->timer.

When the snd_pcm_substream is closing, the aica_channel will be
deallocated. But it could still be dereferenced in the worker
thread. The reason is that del_timer() will return directly
regardless of whether the timer handler is running or not and
the worker could be rescheduled in the timer handler. As a result,
the UAF bug will happen. The racy situation is shown below:

      (Thread 1)                 |      (Thread 2)
snd_aicapcm_pcm_close()          |
 ...                             |  run_spu_dma() //worker
                                 |    mod_timer()
  flush_work()                   |
  del_timer()                    |  aica_period_elapsed() //timer
  kfree(dreamcastcard->channel)  |    schedule_work()
                                 |  run_spu_dma() //worker
  ...                            |    dreamcastcard->channel-> //USE

In order to mitigate this bug and other possible corner cases,
call mod_timer() conditionally in run_spu_dma(), then implement
PCM sync_stop op to cancel both the timer and worker. The sync_stop
op will be called from PCM core appropriately when needed."	7.0	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

time forward just a little bit. Then, if we happen to get
the interrupt after calculating the new time to push to,

the time to a value that's incompatible with the forward,

When switching to another HDMI mode, we are unnecesarilly

the same time when only HPO is supposed to be set.

PM / devfreq: Synchronize devfreq_monitor_[start/stop]

There is a chance if a frequent switch of the governor
done in a loop result in timer list corruption where
timer cancel being done from two place one from
cancel_delayed_work_sync() and followed by expire_timers()
can be seen from the traces[1].

while true

done

It looks to be issue with devfreq driver where
device_monitor_[start/stop] need to synchronized so that
delayed work should get corrupted while it is either
being queued or running or being cancelled.

Let's use polling flag and devfreq lock to synchronize the
queueing the timer instance twice and work data being
corrupted.

libceph: just wait for more data to be available on the socket

A short read may occur while reading the message footer from the
socket.  Later, when the socket is ready for another read, the
messenger invokes all read_partial_*() handlers, including
read_partial_sparse_msg_data().  The expectation is that
read_partial_sparse_msg_data() would bail, allowing the messenger to
invoke read_partial() for the footer and pick up where it left off.

However read_partial_sparse_msg_data() violates that and ends up
calling into the state machine in the OSD client.  The sparse-read
state machine assumes that it's a new op and interprets some piece of
the footer as the sparse-read header and returns bogus extents/data
length, etc.

To determine whether read_partial_sparse_msg_data() should bail, let's
reuse cursor->total_resid.  Because once it reaches to zero that means
all the extents and data have been successfully received in last read,
else it could break out when partially reading any of the extents and
data.  And then osd_sparse_read() could continue where it left off.

drm/amdgpu: fix use-after-free bug

The bug can be triggered by sending a single amdgpu_gem_userptr_ioctl
to the AMDGPU DRM driver on any ASICs with an invalid address and size.
The bug was reported by Joonkyo Jung <joonkyoj@yonsei.ac.kr>.
For example the following code:

static void Syzkaller1(int fd)
{
	struct drm_amdgpu_gem_userptr arg;
	int ret;

	arg.addr = 0xffffffffffff0000;
	arg.size = 0x80000000; /*2 Gb*/
	arg.flags = 0x7;
	ret = drmIoctl(fd, 0xc1186451/*amdgpu_gem_userptr_ioctl*/, &arg);
}

Due to the address and size are not valid there is a failure in
amdgpu_hmm_register->mmu_interval_notifier_insert->__mmu_interval_notifier_insert->
check_shl_overflow, but we even the amdgpu_hmm_register failure we still call
amdgpu_hmm_unregister into  amdgpu_gem_object_free which causes access to a bad address.

CVE-2024-26657	2024-04-02T07:15:42.830	2025-01-07T17:20:00.840	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/sched: fix null-ptr-deref in init entity

The bug can be triggered by sending an amdgpu_cs_wait_ioctl
to the AMDGPU DRM driver on any ASICs with valid context.
The bug was reported by Joonkyo Jung <joonkyoj@yonsei.ac.kr>.
For example the following code:

    static void Syzkaller2(int fd)
    {
	union drm_amdgpu_ctx arg1;
	union drm_amdgpu_wait_cs arg2;

	arg1.in.op = AMDGPU_CTX_OP_ALLOC_CTX;
	ret = drmIoctl(fd, 0x140106442 /* amdgpu_ctx_ioctl */, &arg1);

	arg2.in.handle = 0x0;
	arg2.in.timeout = 0x2000000000000;
	arg2.in.ip_type = AMD_IP_VPE /* 0x9 */;
	arg2->in.ip_instance = 0x0;
	arg2.in.ring = 0x0;
	arg2.in.ctx_id = arg1.out.alloc.ctx_id;

	drmIoctl(fd, 0xc0206449 /* AMDGPU_WAIT_CS * /, &arg2);
    }

The ioctl AMDGPU_WAIT_CS without previously submitted job could be assumed that
the error should be returned, but the following commit 1decbf6bb0b4dc56c9da6c5e57b994ebfc2be3aa
modified the logic and allowed to have sched_rq equal to NULL.

As a result when there is no job the ioctl AMDGPU_WAIT_CS returns success.
The change fixes null-ptr-deref in init entity and the stack below demonstrates
the error condition:

xhci: handle isoc Babble and Buffer Overrun events properly

xHCI 4.9 explicitly forbids assuming that the xHC has released its
ownership of a multi-TRB TD when it reports an error on one of the
early TRBs. Yet the driver makes such assumption and releases the TD,
allowing the remaining TRBs to be freed or overwritten by new TDs.

The xHC should also report completion of the final TRB due to its IOC
flag being set by us, regardless of prior errors. This event cannot
be recognized if the TD has already been freed earlier, resulting in
""Transfer event TRB DMA ptr not part of current TD"" error message.

Fix this by reusing the logic for processing isoc Transaction Errors.
This also handles hosts which fail to report the final completion.

Fix transfer length reporting on Babble errors. They may be caused by

'stream_enc_regs' array is an array of dcn10_stream_enc_registers

to the four calls to stream_enc_regs() in the array initializer. This
means that valid indices for this array are 0, 1, 2, and 3.

The cause of this issue is that when tipc_nl_bearer_add() is called with
the TIPC_NLA_BEARER_UDP_OPTS attribute, tipc_udp_nl_bearer_add() is called
even if the bearer is not UDP.

tipc_udp_is_known_peer() called by tipc_udp_nl_bearer_add() assumes that
the media_ptr field of the tipc_bearer has an udp_bearer type object, so
the function goes crazy for non-UDP bearers.

This patch fixes the issue by checking the bearer type before calling
tipc_udp_nl_bearer_add() in tipc_nl_bearer_add()."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

net/sched: flower: Fix chain template offload

When a qdisc is deleted from a net device the stack instructs the
underlying driver to remove its flow offload callback from the
associated filter block using the 'FLOW_BLOCK_UNBIND' command. The stack
then continues to replay the removal of the filters in the block for
this driver by iterating over the chains in the block and invoking the
'reoffload' operation of the classifier being used. In turn, the
classifier in its 'reoffload' operation prepares and emits a
'FLOW_CLS_DESTROY' command for each filter.

However, the stack does not do the same for chain templates and the
underlying driver never receives a 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_DESTROY' command when
a qdisc is deleted. This results in a memory leak [1] which can be
reproduced using [2].

Fix by introducing a 'tmplt_reoffload' operation and have the stack
invoke it with the appropriate arguments as part of the replay.
Implement the operation in the sole classifier that supports chain
templates (flower) by emitting the 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_{CREATE,DESTROY}'
command based on whether a flow offload callback is being bound to a
filter block or being unbound from one.

As far as I can tell, the issue happens since cited commit which
reordered tcf_block_offload_unbind() before tcf_block_flush_all_chains()
in __tcf_block_put(). The order cannot be reversed as the filter block
is expected to be freed after flushing all the chains.

CVE-2024-26670	2024-04-02T07:15:43.760	2025-10-01T18:15:36.873	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: entry: fix ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD

Currently the ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD workaround isn't
quite right, as it is supposed to be applied after the last explicit
memory access, but is immediately followed by an LDR.

The ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD workaround is used to
handle Cortex-A520 erratum 2966298 and Cortex-A510 erratum 3117295,
which are described in:

* https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN2444153/0600/?lang=en
* https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN1873361/1600/?lang=en

In both cases the workaround is described as:

| If pagetable isolation is disabled, the context switch logic in the
| kernel can be updated to execute the following sequence on affected
| cores before exiting to EL0, and after all explicit memory accesses:
|
| 1. A non-shareable TLBI to any context and/or address, including
|    unused contexts or addresses, such as a `TLBI VALE1 Xzr`.
|
| 2. A DSB NSH to guarantee completion of the TLBI.

The important part being that the TLBI+DSB must be placed ""after all
explicit memory accesses"".

Unfortunately, as-implemented, the TLBI+DSB is immediately followed by
an LDR, as we have:

| alternative_if ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD
| 	tlbi	vale1, xzr
| 	dsb	nsh
| alternative_else_nop_endif
| alternative_if_not ARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0
| 	ldr	lr, [sp, #S_LR]
| 	add	sp, sp, #PT_REGS_SIZE		// restore sp
| 	eret
| alternative_else_nop_endif
|
| [ ... KPTI exception return path ... ]

This patch fixes this by reworking the logic to place the TLBI+DSB
immediately before the ERET, after all explicit memory accesses.

The ERET is currently in a separate alternative block, and alternatives
cannot be nested. To account for this, the alternative block for
ARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0 is replaced with a single alternative branch
to skip the KPTI logic, with the new shape of the logic being:

| alternative_insn ""b .L_skip_tramp_exit_\@"", nop, ARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0
| 	[ ... KPTI exception return path ... ]
| .L_skip_tramp_exit_\@:
|
| 	ldr	lr, [sp, #S_LR]
| 	add	sp, sp, #PT_REGS_SIZE		// restore sp
|
| alternative_if ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD
| 	tlbi	vale1, xzr
| 	dsb	nsh
| alternative_else_nop_endif
| 	eret

The new structure means that the workaround is only applied when KPTI is
not in use; this is fine as noted in the documented implications of the
erratum:

| Pagetable isolation between EL0 and higher level ELs prevents the
| issue from occurring.

... and as per the workaround description quoted above, the workaround
is only necessary ""If pagetable isolation is disabled""."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

The MCA code can recover from an in-kernel #MC if the fixup type is
EX_TYPE_UACCESS, explicitly indicating that the kernel is attempting to
access userspace memory. However, if the fixup type is EX_TYPE_DEFAULT
the only thing that is raised for an in-kernel #MC is a panic.

ex_handler_uaccess() would warn if users gave a non-canonical addresses
(with bit 63 clear) to {get, put}_user(), which was unexpected.

Therefore, commit

  b19b74bc99b1 (""x86/mm: Rework address range check in get_user() and put_user()"")

replaced _ASM_EXTABLE_UA() with _ASM_EXTABLE() for {get, put}_user()
fixups. However, the new fixup type EX_TYPE_DEFAULT results in a panic.

Commit

  6014bc27561f (""x86-64: make access_ok() independent of LAM"")

added the check gp_fault_address_ok() right before the WARN_ONCE() in
ex_handler_uaccess() to not warn about non-canonical user addresses due
to LAM.

With that in place, revert back to _ASM_EXTABLE_UA() for {get,put}_user()
exception fixups in order to be able to handle in-kernel MCEs correctly

CVE-2024-26676	2024-04-02T07:15:44.170	2025-05-07T20:15:23.713	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_unix: Call kfree_skb() for dead unix_(sk)->oob_skb in GC.

syzbot reported a warning [0] in __unix_gc() with a repro, which
creates a socketpair and sends one socket's fd to itself using the
peer.

  socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0, [3, 4]) = 0
  sendmsg(4, {msg_name=NULL, msg_namelen=0, msg_iov=[{iov_base=""\360"", iov_len=1}],
          msg_iovlen=1, msg_control=[{cmsg_len=20, cmsg_level=SOL_SOCKET,
                                      cmsg_type=SCM_RIGHTS, cmsg_data=[3]}],
          msg_controllen=24, msg_flags=0}, MSG_OOB|MSG_PROBE|MSG_DONTWAIT|MSG_ZEROCOPY) = 1

This forms a self-cyclic reference that GC should finally untangle
but does not due to lack of MSG_OOB handling, resulting in memory
leak.

Recently, commit 11498715f266 (""af_unix: Remove io_uring code for
GC."") removed io_uring's dead code in GC and revealed the problem.

The code was executed at the final stage of GC and unconditionally
moved all GC candidates from gc_candidates to gc_inflight_list.
That papered over the reported problem by always making the following
WARN_ON_ONCE(!list_empty(&gc_candidates)) false.

The problem has been there since commit 2aab4b969002 (""af_unix: fix
struct pid leaks in OOB support"") added full scm support for MSG_OOB
while fixing another bug.

To fix this problem, we must call kfree_skb() for unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb
if the socket still exists in gc_candidates after purging collected skb.

Then, we need to set NULL to oob_skb before calling kfree_skb() because
it calls last fput() and triggers unix_release_sock(), where we call
duplicate kfree_skb(u->oob_skb) if not NULL.

Note that the leaked socket remained being linked to a global list, so
kmemleak also could not detect it.  We need to check /proc/net/protocol
to notice the unfreed socket.

x86/efistub: Use 1:1 file:memory mapping for PE/COFF .compat section

The .compat section is a dummy PE section that contains the address of
the 32-bit entrypoint of the 64-bit kernel image if it is bootable from
32-bit firmware (i.e., CONFIG_EFI_MIXED=y)

This section is only 8 bytes in size and is only referenced from the
loader, and so it is placed at the end of the memory view of the image,
to avoid the need for padding it to 4k, which is required for sections
appearing in the middle of the image.

Unfortunately, this violates the PE/COFF spec, and even if most EFI
loaders will work correctly (including the Tianocore reference
implementation), PE loaders do exist that reject such images, on the
basis that both the file and memory views of the file contents should be
described by the section headers in a monotonically increasing manner
without leaving any gaps.

So reorganize the sections to avoid this issue. This results in a slight
padding overhead (< 4k) which can be avoided if desired by disabling
CONFIG_EFI_MIXED (which is only needed in rare cases these days)"	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

we never connect to such an AP.

Improve this situation by checking more carefully and ignoring
the ECSA if cfg80211 has previously detected the ECSA element
being stuck in the probe response.

Additionally, allow connecting to an AP that's switching to a
channel it's already using, unless it's using quiet mode. In
this case, we may just have to adjust bandwidth later. If it's
actually switching channels, it's better not to try to connect

can: j1939: prevent deadlock by changing j1939_socks_lock to rwlock

The following 3 locks would race against each other, causing the
deadlock situation in the Syzbot bug report:

- j1939_socks_lock
- active_session_list_lock
- sk_session_queue_lock

A reasonable fix is to change j1939_socks_lock to an rwlock, since in
the rare situations where a write lock is required for the linked list
that j1939_socks_lock is protecting, the code does not attempt to
acquire any more locks. This would break the circular lock dependency,
where, for example, the current thread already locks j1939_socks_lock
and attempts to acquire sk_session_queue_lock, and at the same time,
another thread attempts to acquire j1939_socks_lock while holding
sk_session_queue_lock.

NOTE: This patch along does not fix the unregister_netdevice bug
reported by Syzbot; instead, it solves a deadlock situation to prepare
for one or more further patches to actually fix the Syzbot bug, which
appears to be a reference counting problem within the j1939 codebase.

nilfs2: fix potential bug in end_buffer_async_write

According to a syzbot report, end_buffer_async_write(), which handles the
completion of block device writes, may detect abnormal condition of the
buffer async_write flag and cause a BUG_ON failure when using nilfs2.

Nilfs2 itself does not use end_buffer_async_write().  But, the async_write
flag is now used as a marker by commit 7f42ec394156 (""nilfs2: fix issue
with race condition of competition between segments for dirty blocks"") as
a means of resolving double list insertion of dirty blocks in
nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() and nilfs_lookup_node_buffers() and the
resulting crash.

This modification is safe as long as it is used for file data and b-tree
node blocks where the page caches are independent.  However, it was
irrelevant and redundant to also introduce async_write for segment summary
and super root blocks that share buffers with the backing device.  This
led to the possibility that the BUG_ON check in end_buffer_async_write
would fail as described above, if independent writebacks of the backing
device occurred in parallel.

The use of async_write for segment summary buffers has already been
removed in a previous change.

Fix this issue by removing the manipulation of the async_write flag for
the remaining super root block buffer."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

xen/events: close evtchn after mapping cleanup

shutdown_pirq and startup_pirq are not taking the
irq_mapping_update_lock because they can't due to lock inversion. Both
are called with the irq_desc->lock being taking. The lock order,
however, is first irq_mapping_update_lock and then irq_desc->lock.

This opens multiple races:
- shutdown_pirq can be interrupted by a function that allocates an event
  channel:

  CPU0                        CPU1
  shutdown_pirq {
    xen_evtchn_close(e)
                              __startup_pirq {
                                EVTCHNOP_bind_pirq
                                  -> returns just freed evtchn e
                                set_evtchn_to_irq(e, irq)
                              }
    xen_irq_info_cleanup() {
      set_evtchn_to_irq(e, -1)
    }
  }

  Assume here event channel e refers here to the same event channel
  number.
  After this race the evtchn_to_irq mapping for e is invalid (-1).

- __startup_pirq races with __unbind_from_irq in a similar way. Because
  __startup_pirq doesn't take irq_mapping_update_lock it can grab the
  evtchn that __unbind_from_irq is currently freeing and cleaning up. In
  this case even though the event channel is allocated, its mapping can
  be unset in evtchn_to_irq.

The fix is to first cleanup the mappings and then close the event
channel. In this way, when an event channel gets allocated it's
potential previous evtchn_to_irq mappings are guaranteed to be unset already.
This is also the reverse order of the allocation where first the event
channel is allocated and then the mappings are setup.

On a 5.10 kernel prior to commit 3fcdaf3d7634 (""xen/events: modify internal
[un]bind interfaces""), we hit a BUG like the following during probing of NVMe
devices. The issue is that during nvme_setup_io_queues, pci_free_irq
is called for every device which results in a call to shutdown_pirq.
With many nvme devices it's therefore likely to hit this race during
boot because there will be multiple calls to shutdown_pirq and
startup_pirq are running potentially in parallel.

fs,hugetlb: fix NULL pointer dereference in hugetlbs_fill_super

When configuring a hugetlb filesystem via the fsconfig() syscall, there is
a possible NULL dereference in hugetlbfs_fill_super() caused by assigning
NULL to ctx->hstate in hugetlbfs_parse_param() when the requested pagesize
is non valid.

E.g: Taking the following steps:

     fd = fsopen(""hugetlbfs"", FSOPEN_CLOEXEC);
     fsconfig(fd, FSCONFIG_SET_STRING, ""pagesize"", ""1024"", 0);
     fsconfig(fd, FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE, NULL, NULL, 0);

Given that the requested ""pagesize"" is invalid, ctxt->hstate will be replaced
with NULL, losing its previous value, and we will print an error:

 ...
 ...
 case Opt_pagesize:
 ps = memparse(param->string, &rest);
 ctx->hstate = h;
 if (!ctx->hstate) {
         pr_err(""Unsupported page size %lu MB\n"", ps / SZ_1M);
         return -EINVAL;
 }
 return 0;
 ...
 ...

This is a problem because later on, we will dereference ctxt->hstate in
hugetlbfs_fill_super()

 ...
 ...
 sb->s_blocksize = huge_page_size(ctx->hstate);
 ...
 ...

Causing below Oops.

Fix this by replacing cxt->hstate value only when then pagesize is known
to be valid.

net: stmmac: protect updates of 64-bit statistics counters

As explained by a comment in <linux/u64_stats_sync.h>, write side of struct
u64_stats_sync must ensure mutual exclusion, or one seqcount update could
be lost on 32-bit platforms, thus blocking readers forever. Such lockups
have been observed in real world after stmmac_xmit() on one CPU raced with
stmmac_napi_poll_tx() on another CPU.

To fix the issue without introducing a new lock, split the statics into
three parts:

1. fields updated only under the tx queue lock,
2. fields updated only during NAPI poll,
3. fields updated only from interrupt context,

Updates to fields in the first two groups are already serialized through
other locks. It is sufficient to split the existing struct u64_stats_sync
so that each group has its own.

Note that tx_set_ic_bit is updated from both contexts. Split this counter
so that each context gets its own, and calculate their sum to get the total
value in stmmac_get_ethtool_stats().

For the third group, multiple interrupts may be processed by different CPUs

smb: Fix regression in writes when non-standard maximum write size negotiated

The conversion to netfs in the 6.3 kernel caused a regression when
maximum write size is set by the server to an unexpected value which is
not a multiple of 4096 (similarly if the user overrides the maximum
write size by setting mount parm ""wsize"", but sets it to a value that
is not a multiple of 4096).  When negotiated write size is not a
multiple of 4096 the netfs code can skip the end of the final
page when doing large sequential writes, causing data corruption.

This section of code is being rewritten/removed due to a large
netfs change, but until that point (ie for the 6.3 kernel until now)
we can not support non-standard maximum write sizes.

Add a warning if a user specifies a wsize on mount that is not
a multiple of 4096 (and round down), also add a change where we
round down the maximum write size if the server negotiates a value

nilfs2: fix hang in nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers()

Syzbot reported a hang issue in migrate_pages_batch() called by mbind()
and nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() called in the log writer of nilfs2.

While migrate_pages_batch() locks a folio and waits for the writeback to
complete, the log writer thread that should bring the writeback to
completion picks up the folio being written back in
nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() that it calls for subsequent log
creation and was trying to lock the folio.  Thus causing a deadlock.

In the first place, it is unexpected that folios/pages in the middle of
writeback will be updated and become dirty.  Nilfs2 adds a checksum to
verify the validity of the log being written and uses it for recovery at
mount, so data changes during writeback are suppressed.  Since this is
broken, an unclean shutdown could potentially cause recovery to fail.

Investigation revealed that the root cause is that the wait for writeback
completion in nilfs_page_mkwrite() is conditional, and if the backing
device does not require stable writes, data may be modified without
waiting.

Fix these issues by making nilfs_page_mkwrite() wait for writeback to
finish regardless of the stable write requirement of the backing device."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

hv_netvsc: Fix race condition between netvsc_probe and netvsc_remove

In commit ac5047671758 (""hv_netvsc: Disable NAPI before closing the
VMBus channel""), napi_disable was getting called for all channels,
including all subchannels without confirming if they are enabled or not.

This caused hv_netvsc getting hung at napi_disable, when netvsc_probe()
has finished running but nvdev->subchan_work has not started yet.
netvsc_subchan_work() -> rndis_set_subchannel() has not created the
sub-channels and because of that netvsc_sc_open() is not running.
netvsc_remove() calls cancel_work_sync(&nvdev->subchan_work), for which
netvsc_subchan_work did not run.

netif_napi_add() sets the bit NAPI_STATE_SCHED because it ensures NAPI
cannot be scheduled. Then netvsc_sc_open() -> napi_enable will clear the
NAPIF_STATE_SCHED bit, so it can be scheduled. napi_disable() does the
opposite.

Now during netvsc_device_remove(), when napi_disable is called for those
subchannels, napi_disable gets stuck on infinite msleep.

This fix addresses this problem by ensuring that napi_disable() is not
getting called for non-enabled NAPI struct.
But netif_napi_del() is still necessary for these non-enabled NAPI struct
for cleanup purpose.

ext4: fix double-free of blocks due to wrong extents moved_len

In ext4_move_extents(), moved_len is only updated when all moves are
successfully executed, and only discards orig_inode and donor_inode
preallocations when moved_len is not zero. When the loop fails to exit
after successfully moving some extents, moved_len is not updated and
remains at 0, so it does not discard the preallocations.

If the moved extents overlap with the preallocated extents, the
overlapped extents are freed twice in ext4_mb_release_inode_pa() and
ext4_process_freed_data() (as described in commit 94d7c16cbbbd (""ext4:
Fix double-free of blocks with EXT4_IOC_MOVE_EXT"")), and bb_free is
incremented twice. Hence when trim is executed, a zero-division bug is
triggered in mb_update_avg_fragment_size() because bb_free is not zero
and bb_fragments is zero.

Therefore, update move_len after each extent move to avoid the issue."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

parisc: Fix random data corruption from exception handler

The current exception handler implementation, which assists when accessing
user space memory, may exhibit random data corruption if the compiler decides
to use a different register than the specified register %r29 (defined in
ASM_EXCEPTIONTABLE_REG) for the error code. If the compiler choose another
register, the fault handler will nevertheless store -EFAULT into %r29 and thus
trash whatever this register is used for.
Looking at the assembly I found that this happens sometimes in emulate_ldd().

To solve the issue, the easiest solution would be if it somehow is
possible to tell the fault handler which register is used to hold the error
code. Using %0 or %1 in the inline assembly is not posssible as it will show
up as e.g. %r29 (with the ""%r"" prefix), which the GNU assembler can not
convert to an integer.

This patch takes another, better and more flexible approach:
We extend the __ex_table (which is out of the execution path) by one 32-word.
In this word we tell the compiler to insert the assembler instruction
""or %r0,%r0,%reg"", where %reg references the register which the compiler
choosed for the error return code.
In case of an access failure, the fault handler finds the __ex_table entry and
can examine the opcode. The used register is encoded in the lowest 5 bits, and
the fault handler can then store -EFAULT into this register.

Since we extend the __ex_table to 3 words we can't use the BUILDTIME_TABLE_SORT
config option any longer."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

netdev_warn_once(). At the very least it will suppress syzkaller

Just in case, use netdev_warn_once() in send_prp_supervision_frame()

CVE-2024-26710	2024-04-03T15:15:53.487	2025-06-19T13:15:31.147	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/kasan: Limit KASAN thread size increase to 32KB

KASAN is seen to increase stack usage, to the point that it was reported
to lead to stack overflow on some 32-bit machines (see link).

To avoid overflows the stack size was doubled for KASAN builds in
commit 3e8635fb2e07 (""powerpc/kasan: Force thread size increase with
KASAN"").

However with a 32KB stack size to begin with, the doubling leads to a
64KB stack, which causes build errors:
  arch/powerpc/kernel/switch.S:249: Error: operand out of range (0x000000000000fe50 is not between 0xffffffffffff8000 and 0x0000000000007fff)

Although the asm could be reworked, in practice a 32KB stack seems
sufficient even for KASAN builds - the additional usage seems to be in
the 2-3KB range for a 64-bit KASAN build.

So only increase the stack for KASAN if the stack size is < 32KB."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

powerpc/kasan: Fix addr error caused by page alignment

In kasan_init_region, when k_start is not page aligned, at the begin of
for loop, k_cur = k_start & PAGE_MASK is less than k_start, and then
`va = block + k_cur - k_start` is less than block, the addr va is invalid,
because the memory address space from va to block is not alloced by
memblock_alloc, which will not be reserved by memblock_reserve later, it
will be used by other places.

As a result, memory overwriting occurs.

for example:
int __init __weak kasan_init_region(void *start, size_t size)
{
[...]
	/* if say block(dcd97000) k_start(feef7400) k_end(feeff3fe) */

		/* at the begin of for loop
		 * block(dcd97000) va(dcd96c00) k_cur(feef7000) k_start(feef7400)
		 * va(dcd96c00) is less than block(dcd97000), va is invalid
		 */
		void *va = block + k_cur - k_start;
		[...]
	}
[...]
}

Therefore, page alignment is performed on k_start before
memblock_alloc() to ensure the validity of the VA address."	4.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

dm-crypt, dm-verity: disable tasklets

Tasklets have an inherent problem with memory corruption. The function
tasklet_action_common calls tasklet_trylock, then it calls the tasklet
callback and then it calls tasklet_unlock. If the tasklet callback frees
the structure that contains the tasklet or if it calls some code that may
free it, tasklet_unlock will write into free memory.

The commits 8e14f610159d and d9a02e016aaf try to fix it for dm-crypt, but
it is not a sufficient fix and the data corruption can still happen [1].
There is no fix for dm-verity and dm-verity will write into free memory
with every tasklet-processed bio.

There will be atomic workqueues implemented in the kernel 6.9 [2]. They
will have better interface and they will not suffer from the memory
corruption problem.

But we need something that stops the memory corruption now and that can be
backported to the stable kernels. So, I'm proposing this commit that
disables tasklets in both dm-crypt and dm-verity. This commit doesn't
remove the tasklet support, because the tasklet code will be reused when
atomic workqueues will be implemented.

drm/i915/dsc: Fix the macro that calculates DSCC_/DSCA_ PPS reg address

Commit bd077259d0a9 (""drm/i915/vdsc: Add function to read any PPS
register"") defines a new macro to calculate the DSC PPS register
addresses with PPS number as an input. This macro correctly calculates
the addresses till PPS 11 since the addresses increment by 4. So in that
case the following macro works correctly to give correct register
address:

_MMIO(_DSCA_PPS_0 + (pps) * 4)

However after PPS 11, the register address for PPS 12 increments by 12
because of RC Buffer memory allocation in between. Because of this
discontinuity in the address space, the macro calculates wrong addresses
for PPS 12 - 16 resulting into incorrect DSC PPS parameter value
read/writes causing DSC corruption.

This fixes it by correcting this macro to add the offset of 12 for PPS
>=12.

The reason is because when adding a interface under the lag it would go
through all the ports and try to figure out which other ports are under
that lag interface. And the issue is that lan966x can have ports that are
NULL pointer as they are not probed. So then iterating over these ports

The issue as follows: __netlink_dump_start() calls control->start(cb)
with nlk->cb_mutex held. In control->start(cb) the dpll_lock is taken.
Then nlk->cb_mutex is released and taken again in netlink_dump(), while
dpll_lock still being held. That leads to ABBA deadlock when another
CPU races with the same operation.

Fix this by moving dpll_lock taking into dumpit() callback which ensures
correct lock taking order."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

This happens because we fail to write out the free space cache in one
instance, come back around and attempt to write it again.  However on
the second pass through we go to call btrfs_get_extent() on the inode to
get the extent mapping.  Because this is a new block group, and with the
free space inode we always search the commit root to avoid deadlocking
with the tree, we find nothing and return a EXTENT_MAP_HOLE for the
requested range.

This happens because the first time we try to write the space cache out
we hit an error, and on an error we drop the extent mapping.  This is
normal for normal files, but the free space cache inode is special.  We
always expect the extent map to be correct.  Thus the second time
through we end up with a bogus extent map.

Since we're deprecating this feature, the most straightforward way to
fix this is to simply skip dropping the extent map range for this failed
range.

I shortened the test by using error injection to stress the area to make
it easier to reproduce.  With this patch in place we no longer panic
with my error injection test."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

 ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---

[CAUSE]
During create_subvol(), after inserting root item for the newly created
subvolume, we would trigger btrfs_get_new_fs_root() to get the
btrfs_root of that subvolume.

The idea here is, we have preallocated an anonymous device number for
the subvolume, thus we can assign it to the new subvolume.

But there is really nothing preventing things like backref walk to read
the new subvolume.
If that happens before we call btrfs_get_new_fs_root(), the subvolume
would be read out, with a new anonymous device number assigned already.

In that case, we would trigger ASSERT(), as we really expect no one to
read out that subvolume (which is not yet accessible from the fs).
But things like backref walk is still possible to trigger the read on
the subvolume.

Thus our assumption on the ASSERT() is not correct in the first place.

[FIX]
Fix it by removing the ASSERT(), and just free the @anon_dev, reset it
to 0, and continue.

If the subvolume tree is read out by something else, it should have
already get a new anon_dev assigned thus we only need to free the
preallocated one."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

drm/amd/display: Fix potential null pointer dereference in dc_dmub_srv

Fixes potential null pointer dereference warnings in the
dc_dmub_srv_cmd_list_queue_execute() and dc_dmub_srv_is_hw_pwr_up()
functions.

In both functions, the 'dc_dmub_srv' variable was being dereferenced
before it was checked for null. This could lead to a null pointer
dereference if 'dc_dmub_srv' is null. The fix is to check if
'dc_dmub_srv' is null before dereferencing it.

Thus moving the null checks for 'dc_dmub_srv' to the beginning of the
functions to ensure that 'dc_dmub_srv' is not null when it is
dereferenced.

net: implement lockless setsockopt(SO_PEEK_OFF)

syzbot reported a lockdep violation [1] involving af_unix
support of SO_PEEK_OFF.

Since SO_PEEK_OFF is inherently not thread safe (it uses a per-socket
sk_peek_off field), there is really no point to enforce a pointless
thread safety in the kernel.

After this patch :

- setsockopt(SO_PEEK_OFF) no longer acquires the socket lock.

- skb_consume_udp() no longer has to acquire the socket lock.

- af_unix no longer needs a special version of sk_set_peek_off(),
  because it does not lock u->iolock anymore.

As a followup, we could replace prot->set_peek_off to be a boolean
and avoid an indirect call, since we always use sk_set_peek_off().

arp: Prevent overflow in arp_req_get().

syzkaller reported an overflown write in arp_req_get(). [0]

When ioctl(SIOCGARP) is issued, arp_req_get() looks up an neighbour
entry and copies neigh->ha to struct arpreq.arp_ha.sa_data.

The arp_ha here is struct sockaddr, not struct sockaddr_storage, so
the sa_data buffer is just 14 bytes.

In the splat below, 2 bytes are overflown to the next int field,
arp_flags.  We initialise the field just after the memcpy(), so it's
not a problem.

However, when dev->addr_len is greater than 22 (e.g. MAX_ADDR_LEN),
arp_netmask is overwritten, which could be set as htonl(0xFFFFFFFFUL)
in arp_ioctl() before calling arp_req_get().

To avoid the overflow, let's limit the max length of memcpy().

Note that commit b5f0de6df6dc (""net: dev: Convert sa_data to flexible
array in struct sockaddr"") just silenced syzkaller.

bpf: Fix racing between bpf_timer_cancel_and_free and bpf_timer_cancel

The following race is possible between bpf_timer_cancel_and_free
and bpf_timer_cancel. It will lead a UAF on the timer->timer.

bpf_timer_cancel();
	spin_lock();
	t = timer->time;

						t = timer->timer;

						spin_unlock();
						hrtimer_cancel(&t->timer);
						kfree(t);

	hrtimer_cancel(&t->timer);

In bpf_timer_cancel_and_free, this patch frees the timer->timer
after a rcu grace period. This requires a rcu_head addition
to the ""struct bpf_hrtimer"". Another kfree(t) happens in bpf_timer_init,
this does not need a kfree_rcu because it is still under the
spin_lock and timer->timer has not been visible by others yet.

In bpf_timer_cancel, rcu_read_lock() is added because this helper
can be used in a non rcu critical section context (e.g. from
a sleepable bpf prog). Other timer->timer usages in helpers.c
have been audited, bpf_timer_cancel() is the only place where
timer->timer is used outside of the spin_lock.

Another solution considered is to mark a t->flag in bpf_timer_cancel
and clear it after hrtimer_cancel() is done.  In bpf_timer_cancel_and_free,
it busy waits for the flag to be cleared before kfree(t). This patch
goes with a straight forward solution and frees timer->timer after
a rcu grace period."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Commit a940904443e4 (""powerpc/iommu: Add iommu_ops to report capabilities
and allow blocking domains"") broke DLPAR add of PCI devices.

The above added iommu_device structure to pci_controller. During
system boot, PCI devices are discovered and this newly added iommu_device
structure is initialized by a call to iommu_device_register().

During DLPAR add of a PCI device, a new pci_controller structure is
allocated but there are no calls made to iommu_device_register()
interface.

Fix is to register the iommu device during DLPAR add as well."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

The test Davide added in commit ca22da2fbd69 (""act_mirred: use the backlog

runs, with the familiar tcp_v4_rcv -> tcp_v4_rcv deadlock reported by
lockdep.

The problem as previously described by Davide (see Link) is that
if we reverse flow of traffic with the redirect (egress -> ingress)
we may reach the same socket which generated the packet. And we may
still be holding its socket lock. The common solution to such deadlocks
is to put the packet in the Rx backlog, rather than run the Rx path
inline. Do that for all egress -> ingress reversals, not just once
we started to nest mirred calls.

In the past there was a concern that the backlog indirection will
lead to loss of error reporting / less accurate stats. But the current
workaround does not seem to address the issue."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2024-26741	2024-04-03T17:15:51.457	2025-03-17T16:03:52.647	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dccp/tcp: Unhash sk from ehash for tb2 alloc failure after check_estalblished().

syzkaller reported a warning [0] in inet_csk_destroy_sock() with no
repro.

  WARN_ON(inet_sk(sk)->inet_num && !inet_csk(sk)->icsk_bind_hash);

However, the syzkaller's log hinted that connect() failed just before
the warning due to FAULT_INJECTION.  [1]

When connect() is called for an unbound socket, we search for an
available ephemeral port.  If a bhash bucket exists for the port, we
call __inet_check_established() or __inet6_check_established() to check
if the bucket is reusable.

If reusable, we add the socket into ehash and set inet_sk(sk)->inet_num.

Later, we look up the corresponding bhash2 bucket and try to allocate
it if it does not exist.

Although it rarely occurs in real use, if the allocation fails, we must
revert the changes by check_established().  Otherwise, an unconnected
socket could illegally occupy an ehash entry.

Note that we do not put tw back into ehash because sk might have
already responded to a packet for tw and it would be better to free
tw earlier under such memory presure.

l2tp_ip6_sendmsg needs to avoid accounting for the transport header

To manage this, we check whether the skbuff contains data using
skb_queue_empty when deciding how much data to append using
ip6_append_data.

However, the code which performed the calculation was incorrect:

     ulen = len + skb_queue_empty(&sk->sk_write_queue) ? transhdrlen : 0;

transhdrlen for messages with a non-zero length, which results in

3) then issue an IO across reshpae position, this IO will wait for
   reshape to make progress;

4) continue to reshape, then md_start_sync() found there is a spare disk

register new sync_thread in the first place. And if the array is
read-write and sync_thread is registered, md_set_readonly() will
unregister sync_thread before setting the array read-only. md/raid
follow this behavior hence there is no problem.

CVE-2024-26759	2024-04-03T17:15:52.320	2025-04-16T19:15:50.920	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/swap: fix race when skipping swapcache

When skipping swapcache for SWP_SYNCHRONOUS_IO, if two or more threads
swapin the same entry at the same time, they get different pages (A, B). 
Before one thread (T0) finishes the swapin and installs page (A) to the
PTE, another thread (T1) could finish swapin of page (B), swap_free the
entry, then swap out the possibly modified page reusing the same entry. 
It breaks the pte_same check in (T0) because PTE value is unchanged,
causing ABA problem.  Thread (T0) will install a stalled page (A) into the
PTE and cause data corruption.

One possible callstack is like this:

CPU0                                 CPU1
----                                 ----
do_swap_page()                       do_swap_page() with same entry
<direct swapin path>                 <direct swapin path>
<alloc page A>                       <alloc page B>
swap_read_folio() <- read to page A  swap_read_folio() <- read to page B
<slow on later locks or interrupt>   <finished swapin first>
...                                  set_pte_at()
                                     swap_free() <- entry is free
                                     <write to page B, now page A stalled>
                                     <swap out page B to same swap entry>
pte_same() <- Check pass, PTE seems
              unchanged, but page A
              is stalled!
swap_free() <- page B content lost!
set_pte_at() <- staled page A installed!

And besides, for ZRAM, swap_free() allows the swap device to discard the
entry content, so even if page (B) is not modified, if swap_read_folio()
on CPU0 happens later than swap_free() on CPU1, it may also cause data
loss.

To fix this, reuse swapcache_prepare which will pin the swap entry using
the cache flag, and allow only one thread to swap it in, also prevent any
parallel code from putting the entry in the cache.  Release the pin after
PT unlocked.

Racers just loop and wait since it's a rare and very short event.  A
schedule_timeout_uninterruptible(1) call is added to avoid repeated page
faults wasting too much CPU, causing livelock or adding too much noise to
perf statistics.  A similar livelock issue was described in commit
029c4628b2eb (""mm: swap: get rid of livelock in swapin readahead"")

Reproducer:

This race issue can be triggered easily using a well constructed
reproducer and patched brd (with a delay in read path) [1]:

With latest 6.8 mainline, race caused data loss can be observed easily:
$ gcc -g -lpthread test-thread-swap-race.c && ./a.out
  Polulating 32MB of memory region...
  Keep swapping out...
  Starting round 0...
  Spawning 65536 workers...
  32746 workers spawned, wait for done...
  Round 0: Error on 0x5aa00, expected 32746, got 32743, 3 data loss!
  Round 0: Error on 0x395200, expected 32746, got 32743, 3 data loss!
  Round 0: Error on 0x3fd000, expected 32746, got 32737, 9 data loss!
  Round 0 Failed, 15 data loss!

This reproducer spawns multiple threads sharing the same memory region
using a small swap device.  Every two threads updates mapped pages one by
one in opposite direction trying to create a race, with one dedicated
thread keep swapping out the data out using madvise.

The reproducer created a reproduce rate of about once every 5 minutes, so
the race should be totally possible in production.

After this patch, I ran the reproducer for over a few hundred rounds and
no data loss observed.

cxl/pci: Fix disabling memory if DVSEC CXL Range does not match a CFMWS window

The Linux CXL subsystem is built on the assumption that HPA == SPA.
That is, the host physical address (HPA) the HDM decoder registers are
programmed with are system physical addresses (SPA).

During HDM decoder setup, the DVSEC CXL range registers (cxl-3.1,
8.1.3.8) are checked if the memory is enabled and the CXL range is in
a HPA window that is described in a CFMWS structure of the CXL host
bridge (cxl-3.1, 9.18.1.3).

Now, if the HPA is not an SPA, the CXL range does not match a CFMWS
window and the CXL memory range will be disabled then. The HDM decoder
stops working which causes system memory being disabled and further a
system hang during HDM decoder initialization, typically when a CXL
enabled kernel boots.

Prevent a system hang and do not disable the HDM decoder if the
decoder's CXL range is not found in a CFMWS window.

Note the change only fixes a hardware hang, but does not implement
HPA/SPA translation. Support for this can be added in a follow on

The PCI AER model is an awkward fit for CXL error handling. While the
expectation is that a PCI device can escalate to link reset to recover
from an AER event, the same reset on CXL amounts to a surprise memory
hotplug of massive amounts of memory.

At present, the CXL error handler attempts some optimistic error
handling to unbind the device from the cxl_mem driver after reaping some
RAS register values. This results in a ""hopeful"" attempt to unplug the
memory, but there is no guarantee that will succeed.

A subsequent AER notification after the memdev unbind event can no
longer assume the registers are mapped. Check for memdev bind before
reaping status register values to avoid crashes of the form:

If an SDMA send consists of exactly 6 descriptors and requires dword
padding (in the 7th descriptor), the sdma_txreq descriptor array is not
properly expanded and the packet will overflow into the container
structure. This results in a panic when the send completion runs. The
exact panic varies depending on what elements of the container structure
get corrupted. The fix is to use the correct expression in
_pad_sdma_tx_descs() to test the need to expand the descriptor array.

With this patch the crashes are no longer reproducible and the machine is
stable."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

LoongArch: Change acpi_core_pic[NR_CPUS] to acpi_core_pic[MAX_CORE_PIC]

With default config, the value of NR_CPUS is 64. When HW platform has
more then 64 cpus, system will crash on these platforms. MAX_CORE_PIC
is the maximum cpu number in MADT table (max physical number) which can
exceed the supported maximum cpu number (NR_CPUS, max logical number),
but kernel should not crash. Kernel should boot cpus with NR_CPUS, let
the remainder cpus stay in BIOS.

The potential crash reason is that the array acpi_core_pic[NR_CPUS] can
be overflowed when parsing MADT table, and it is obvious that CORE_PIC
should be corresponding to physical core rather than logical core, so it
is better to define the array as acpi_core_pic[MAX_CORE_PIC].

With the patch, system can boot up 64 vcpus with qemu parameter -smp 128,
otherwise system will crash with the following message.

For the SR-IOV case, default DMA window ""ibm,dma-window"" is removed from
the FDT and DDW added, for the device.

Now, kexec hands over control to the kdump kernel.

When the kdump kernel initializes, PCI busses are scanned and IOMMU
group/tables created, in pci_dma_bus_setup_pSeriesLP(). For the SR-IOV
case, there is no ""ibm,dma-window"". The original commit: b1fc44eaa9ba,
fixes the path where memory is pre-mapped (direct mapped) to the DDW.
When TCEs are direct mapped, there is no need to initialize IOMMU
tables.

iommu_table_setparms_lpar() only considers ""ibm,dma-window"" property
when initiallizing IOMMU table. In the scenario where TCEs are
dynamically allocated for SR-IOV, newly created IOMMU table is not
initialized. Later, when the device driver tries to enter TCEs for the
SR-IOV device, NULL pointer execption is thrown from iommu_area_alloc().

The fix is to initialize the IOMMU table with DDW property stored in the
FDT. There are 2 points to remember:

	1. For the dedicated adapter, kdump kernel would encounter both
	   default and DDW in FDT. In this case, DDW property is used to
	   initialize the IOMMU table.

	2. A DDW could be direct or dynamic mapped. kdump kernel would
	   initialize IOMMU table and mark the existing DDW as
	   ""dynamic"". This works fine since, at the time of table
	   initialization, iommu_table_clear() makes some space in the
	   DDW, for some predefined number of TCEs which are needed for
	   kdump to succeed."	4.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

af_unix: Drop oob_skb ref before purging queue in GC.

syzbot reported another task hung in __unix_gc().  [0]

The current while loop assumes that all of the left candidates
have oob_skb and calling kfree_skb(oob_skb) releases the remaining
candidates.

However, I missed a case that oob_skb has self-referencing fd and
another fd and the latter sk is placed before the former in the
candidate list.  Then, the while loop never proceeds, resulting
the task hung.

__unix_gc() has the same loop just before purging the collected skb,
so we can call kfree_skb(oob_skb) there and let __skb_queue_purge()
release all inflight sockets.

af_unix: Fix task hung while purging oob_skb in GC.

syzbot reported a task hung; at the same time, GC was looping infinitely
in list_for_each_entry_safe() for OOB skb.  [0]

syzbot demonstrated that the list_for_each_entry_safe() was not actually
safe in this case.

A single skb could have references for multiple sockets.  If we free such
a skb in the list_for_each_entry_safe(), the current and next sockets could
be unlinked in a single iteration.

unix_notinflight() uses list_del_init() to unlink the socket, so the
prefetched next socket forms a loop itself and list_for_each_entry_safe()
never stops.

Here, we must use while() and make sure we always fetch the first socket.

With numa balancing on, when a numa system is running where a numa node

oops has been observed.  It's because wakeup_kswapd() is called with a
wrong zone index, -1.  Fixed it by checking the index before calling
wakeup_kswapd().

On unloading of the scmi_perf_domain module got the below splat, when in
the DT provided to the system under test the '#power-domain-cells' property

early without giving any error, which leads to the ->remove() callback gets
to run too, but without all the expected initialized structures in place.

Add a check and bail out early on remove too.

crypto: arm64/neonbs - fix out-of-bounds access on short input

The bit-sliced implementation of AES-CTR operates on blocks of 128
bytes, and will fall back to the plain NEON version for tail blocks or
inputs that are shorter than 128 bytes to begin with.

It will call straight into the plain NEON asm helper, which performs all
memory accesses in granules of 16 bytes (the size of a NEON register).
For this reason, the associated plain NEON glue code will copy inputs
shorter than 16 bytes into a temporary buffer, given that this is a rare
occurrence and it is not worth the effort to work around this in the asm
code.

The fallback from the bit-sliced NEON version fails to take this into
account, potentially resulting in out-of-bounds accesses. So clone the
same workaround, and use a temp buffer for short in/outputs."	7.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H

btrfs: fix double free of anonymous device after snapshot creation failure

When creating a snapshot we may do a double free of an anonymous device
in case there's an error committing the transaction. The second free may
result in freeing an anonymous device number that was allocated by some
other subsystem in the kernel or another btrfs filesystem.

The steps that lead to this:

1) At ioctl.c:create_snapshot() we allocate an anonymous device number
   and assign it to pending_snapshot->anon_dev;

2) Then we call btrfs_commit_transaction() and end up at
   transaction.c:create_pending_snapshot();

3) There we call btrfs_get_new_fs_root() and pass it the anonymous device
   number stored in pending_snapshot->anon_dev;

4) btrfs_get_new_fs_root() frees that anonymous device number because
   btrfs_lookup_fs_root() returned a root - someone else did a lookup
   of the new root already, which could some task doing backref walking;

5) After that some error happens in the transaction commit path, and at
   ioctl.c:create_snapshot() we jump to the 'fail' label, and after
   that we free again the same anonymous device number, which in the
   meanwhile may have been reallocated somewhere else, because
   pending_snapshot->anon_dev still has the same value as in step 1.

Recently syzbot ran into this and reported the following trace:

fbcon: always restore the old font data in fbcon_do_set_font()

Commit a5a923038d70 (fbdev: fbcon: Properly revert changes when
vc_resize() failed) started restoring old font data upon failure (of
vc_resize()). But it performs so only for user fonts. It means that the
""system""/internal fonts are not restored at all. So in result, the very
first call to fbcon_do_set_font() performs no restore at all upon
failing vc_resize().

This can be reproduced by Syzkaller to crash the system on the next
invocation of font_get(). It's rather hard to hit the allocation failure
in vc_resize() on the first font_set(), but not impossible. Esp. if
fault injection is used to aid the execution/failure. It was
demonstrated by Sirius:

stmmac: Clear variable when destroying workqueue

Currently when suspending driver and stopping workqueue it is checked whether
workqueue is not NULL and if so, it is destroyed.
Function destroy_workqueue() does drain queue and does clear variable, but
it does not set workqueue variable to NULL. This can cause kernel/module
panic if code attempts to clear workqueue that was not initialized.

This scenario is possible when resuming suspended driver in stmmac_resume(),
because there is no handling for failed stmmac_hw_setup(),
which can fail and return if DMA engine has failed to initialize,
and workqueue is initialized after DMA engine.
Should DMA engine fail to initialize, resume will proceed normally,
but interface won't work and TX queue will eventually timeout,
causing 'Reset adapter' error.
This then does destroy workqueue during reset process.
And since workqueue is initialized after DMA engine and can be skipped,
it will cause kernel/module panic.

To secure against this possible crash, set workqueue variable to NULL when
destroying workqueue.

net: veth: clear GRO when clearing XDP even when down

veth sets NETIF_F_GRO automatically when XDP is enabled,
because both features use the same NAPI machinery.

The logic to clear NETIF_F_GRO sits in veth_disable_xdp() which
is called both on ndo_stop and when XDP is turned off.
To avoid the flag from being cleared when the device is brought
down, the clearing is skipped when IFF_UP is not set.
Bringing the device down should indeed not modify its features.

Unfortunately, this means that clearing is also skipped when
XDP is disabled _while_ the device is down. And there's nothing
on the open path to bring the device features back into sync.
IOW if user enables XDP, disables it and then brings the device
up we'll end up with a stray GRO flag set but no NAPI instances.

We don't depend on the GRO flag on the datapath, so the datapath
won't crash. We will crash (or hang), however, next time features
are sync'ed (either by user via ethtool or peer changing its config).
The GRO flag will go away, and veth will try to disable the NAPIs.
But the open path never created them since XDP was off, the GRO flag
was a stray. If NAPI was initialized before we'll hang in napi_disable().
If it never was we'll crash trying to stop uninitialized hrtimer.

Move the GRO flag updates to the XDP enable / disable paths,

The splat occurs because skb->data points past skb->head allocated area.
This is because neigh layer does:
  __skb_pull(skb, skb_network_offset(skb));

... but skb_network_offset() returns a negative offset and __skb_pull()
arg is unsigned.  IOW, we skb->data gets ""adjusted"" by a huge value.

The negative value is returned because skb->head and skb->data distance is
more than 64k and skb->network_header (u16) has wrapped around.

The bug is in the ip_tunnel infrastructure, which can cause
dev->needed_headroom to increment ad infinitum.

The syzkaller reproducer consists of packets getting routed via a gre
tunnel, and route of gre encapsulated packets pointing at another (ipip)
tunnel.  The ipip encapsulation finds gre0 as next output device.

This results in the following pattern:

1). First packet is to be sent out via gre0.
Route lookup found an output device, ipip0.

2).
ip_tunnel_xmit for gre0 bumps gre0->needed_headroom based on the future
output device, rt.dev->needed_headroom (ipip0).

3).
ip output / start_xmit moves skb on to ipip0. which runs the same
code path again (xmit recursion).

4).
Routing step for the post-gre0-encap packet finds gre0 as output device
to use for ipip0 encapsulated packet.

tunl0->needed_headroom is then incremented based on the (already bumped)
gre0 device headroom.

This repeats for every future packet:

gre0->needed_headroom gets inflated because previous packets' ipip0 step
incremented rt->dev (gre0) headroom, and ipip0 incremented because gre0
needed_headroom was increased.

For each subsequent packet, gre/ipip0->needed_headroom grows until
post-expand-head reallocations result in a skb->head/data distance of
more than 64k.

Once that happens, skb->network_header (u16) wraps around when
pskb_expand_head tries to make sure that skb_network_offset() is unchanged
after the headroom expansion/reallocation.

After this skb_network_offset(skb) returns a different (and negative)
result post headroom expansion.

The next trip to neigh layer (or anything else that would __skb_pull the
network header) makes skb->data point to a memory location outside
skb->head area.

v2: Cap the needed_headroom update to an arbitarily chosen upperlimit to
prevent perpetual increase instead of dropping the headroom increment
completely."	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

netlink: Fix kernel-infoleak-after-free in __skb_datagram_iter

syzbot reported the following uninit-value access issue [1]:

netlink_to_full_skb() creates a new `skb` and puts the `skb->data`
passed as a 1st arg of netlink_to_full_skb() onto new `skb`. The data
size is specified as `len` and passed to skb_put_data(). This `len`
is based on `skb->end` that is not data offset but buffer offset. The
`skb->end` contains data and tailroom. Since the tailroom is not
initialized when the new `skb` created, KMSAN detects uninitialized
memory area when copying the data.

This patch resolved this issue by correct the len from `skb->end` to
`skb->len`, which is the actual data offset.

spi: cadence-qspi: remove system-wide suspend helper calls from runtime PM hooks

The ->runtime_suspend() and ->runtime_resume() callbacks are not
expected to call spi_controller_suspend() and spi_controller_resume().
Remove calls to those in the cadence-qspi driver.

Those helpers have two roles currently:
 - They stop/start the queue, including dealing with the kworker.
 - They toggle the SPI controller SPI_CONTROLLER_SUSPENDED flag. It
   requires acquiring ctlr->bus_lock_mutex.

Step one is irrelevant because cadence-qspi is not queued. Step two
however has two implications:
 - A deadlock occurs, because ->runtime_resume() is called in a context
   where the lock is already taken (in the ->exec_op() callback, where
   the usage count is incremented).
 - It would disallow all operations once the device is auto-suspended.

Here is a brief call tree highlighting the mutex deadlock:

it is not the case. ""struct spi_controller"" is allocated by
devm_spi_alloc_host(), which allocates an extra amount of memory for
private data, used to store ""struct cqspi_st"".

The ->probe() function of the cadence-quadspi driver then sets the
device drvdata to store the address of the ""struct cqspi_st""
structure. Therefore:

	struct cqspi_st *cqspi = dev_get_drvdata(dev);

is correct, but:

	struct spi_controller *host = dev_get_drvdata(dev);

is not, as it makes ""host"" point not to a ""struct spi_controller"" but
to the same ""struct cqspi_st"" structure as above.

This obviously leads to bad things (memory corruption, kernel crashes)
directly during ->probe(), as ->probe() enables the device using PM
runtime, leading the ->runtime_resume() hook being called, which in
turns calls spi_controller_resume() with the wrong pointer.

This has at least been reported [0] to cause a kernel crash, but the
exact behavior will depend on the memory contents.

Versions of Livemarks prior to 3.7 are vulnerable to cross-site request forgery. A malicious website may be able to coerce the extension to send an authenticated GET request to an arbitrary URL. An authenticated request is a request where the cookies of the browser are sent along with the request. The `subscribe.js` script uses the first parameter from the current URL location as the URL of the RSS feed to subscribe to and checks that the RSS feed is valid XML. `subscribe.js` is accessible by an attacker website due to its use in `subscribe.html`, an HTML page that is declared as a `web_accessible_resource` in `manifest.json`. This issue may lead to `Privilege Escalation`. A CSRF breaks the integrity of servers running on a private network. A user of the browser extension may have a private server with dangerous functionality, which is assumed to be safe due to network segmentation. Upon receiving an authenticated request instantiated from an attacker, this integrity is broken. Version 3.7 fixes this issue by removing subscribe.html from `web_accessible_resources`.

The HTTP/2 protocol stack in Envoy versions prior to 1.29.3, 1.28.2, 1.27.4, and 1.26.8 are vulnerable to CPU exhaustion due to flood of CONTINUATION frames. Envoy's HTTP/2 codec allows the client to send an unlimited number of CONTINUATION frames even after exceeding Envoy's header map limits. This allows an attacker to send a sequence of CONTINUATION frames without the END_HEADERS bit set causing CPU utilization, consuming approximately 1 core per 300Mbit/s of traffic and culminating in denial of service through CPU exhaustion. Users should upgrade to version 1.29.3, 1.28.2, 1.27.4, or 1.26.8 to mitigate the effects of the CONTINUATION flood. As a workaround, disable HTTP/2 protocol for downstream connections.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L		
CVE-2023-45288	2024-04-04T21:15:16.113	2024-11-21T08:26:42.380	An attacker may cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data by sending an excessive number of CONTINUATION frames. Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

A security vulnerability has been identified in mailcow affecting versions prior to 2024-04. This vulnerability resides in the exception handling mechanism, specifically when not operating in DEV_MODE. The system saves exception details into a session array without proper sanitization or encoding.

CVE-2024-31210	2024-04-04T23:15:16.127	2024-11-21T09:13:02.827	"WordPress is an open publishing platform for the Web. It's possible for a file of a type other than a zip file to be submitted as a new plugin by an administrative user on the Plugins -> Add New -> Upload Plugin screen in WordPress. If FTP credentials are requested for installation (in order to move the file into place outside of the `uploads` directory) then the uploaded file remains temporary available in the Media Library despite it not being allowed. If the `DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT` constant is set to `true` on the site _and_ FTP credentials are required when uploading a new theme or plugin, then this technically allows an RCE when the user would otherwise have no means of executing arbitrary PHP code. This issue _only_ affects Administrator level users on single site installations, and Super Admin level users on Multisite installations where it's otherwise expected that the user does not have permission to upload or execute arbitrary PHP code. Lower level users are not affected. Sites where the `DISALLOW_FILE_MODS` constant is set to `true` are not affected. Sites where an administrative user either does not need to enter FTP credentials or they have access to the valid FTP credentials, are not affected. The issue was fixed in WordPress 6.4.3 on January 30, 2024 and backported to versions 6.3.3, 6.2.4, 6.1.5, 6.0.7, 5.9.9, 5.8.9, 5.7.11, 5.6.13, 5.5.14, 5.4.15, 5.3.17, 5.2.20, 5.1.18, 5.0.21, 4.9.25, 2.8.24, 4.7.28, 4.6.28, 4.5.31, 4.4.32, 4.3.33, 4.2.37, and 4.1.40. A workaround is available. If the `DISALLOW_FILE_MODS` constant is defined as `true` then it will not be possible for any user to upload a plugin and therefore this issue will not be exploitable.

vfio/pci: Lock external INTx masking ops

Mask operations through config space changes to DisINTx may race INTx
configuration changes via ioctl.  Create wrappers that add locking for
paths outside of the core interrupt code.

In particular, irq_type is updated holding igate, therefore testing
is_intx() requires holding igate.  For example clearing DisINTx from
config space can otherwise race changes of the interrupt configuration.

This aligns interfaces which may trigger the INTx eventfd into two

vfio/pci: Create persistent INTx handler

A vulnerability exists where the eventfd for INTx signaling can be
deconfigured, which unregisters the IRQ handler but still allows
eventfds to be signaled with a NULL context through the SET_IRQS ioctl
or through unmask irqfd if the device interrupt is pending.

Ideally this could be solved with some additional locking; the igate
mutex serializes the ioctl and config space accesses, and the interrupt
handler is unregistered relative to the trigger, but the irqfd path
runs asynchronous to those.  The igate mutex cannot be acquired from the
atomic context of the eventfd wake function.  Disabling the irqfd
relative to the eventfd registration is potentially incompatible with
existing userspace.

As a result, the solution implemented here moves configuration of the
INTx interrupt handler to track the lifetime of the INTx context object
and irq_type configuration, rather than registration of a particular
trigger eventfd.  Synchronization is added between the ioctl path and
eventfd_signal() wrapper such that the eventfd trigger can be
dynamically updated relative to in-flight interrupts or irqfd callbacks."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

vfio/platform: Create persistent IRQ handlers

The vfio-platform SET_IRQS ioctl currently allows loopback triggering of
an interrupt before a signaling eventfd has been configured by the user,
which thereby allows a NULL pointer dereference.

Rather than register the IRQ relative to a valid trigger, register all
IRQs in a disabled state in the device open path.  This allows mask
operations on the IRQ to nest within the overall enable state governed
by a valid eventfd signal.  This decouples @masked, protected by the
@locked spinlock from @trigger, protected via the @igate mutex.

In doing so, it's guaranteed that changes to @trigger cannot race the
IRQ handlers because the IRQ handler is synchronously disabled before
modifying the trigger, and loopback triggering of the IRQ via ioctl is
safe due to serialization with trigger changes via igate.

For compatibility, request_irq() failures are maintained to be local to
the SET_IRQS ioctl rather than a fatal error in the open device path.
This allows, for example, a userspace driver with polling mode support
to continue to work regardless of moving the request_irq() call site.

eventfd to -1.  The interrupt handler itself is guaranteed that
trigger is always valid between request_irq() and free_irq(), but
the loopback testing mechanisms to invoke the handler function
need to test the trigger.  The triggering and setting ioctl paths
both make use of igate and are therefore mutually exclusive.

This affects the ARM backend and can be demonstrated with Clang. NOTE: the vendor perspective is ""we don't have strong objections for a CVE to be created ... It does seem that the likelihood of this miscompile enabling an exploit remains very low, because the miscompile resulting in this JOP gadget is such that the function is most likely to crash on most valid inputs to the function. So, if this function is covered by any testing, the miscompile is most likely to be discovered before the binary is shipped to production."""	5.9	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

memory growth when processing TLSv1.3 sessions

Impact summary: An attacker may exploit certain server configurations to trigger
unbounded memory growth that would lead to a Denial of Service

This problem can occur in TLSv1.3 if the non-default SSL_OP_NO_TICKET option is
being used (but not if early_data support is also configured and the default
anti-replay protection is in use). In this case, under certain conditions, the
session cache can get into an incorrect state and it will fail to flush properly
as it fills. The session cache will continue to grow in an unbounded manner. A
malicious client could deliberately create the scenario for this failure to
force a Denial of Service. It may also happen by accident in normal operation.

This issue only affects TLS servers supporting TLSv1.3. It does not affect TLS
clients.

The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue. OpenSSL
1.0.2 is also not affected by this issue."	5.9	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

The patch that addressed CVE-2023-40581 attempted to prevent RCE when using `--exec` with `%q` by replacing double quotes with two double quotes. However, this escaping is not sufficient, and still allows expansion of environment variables. Support for output template expansion in `--exec`, along with this vulnerable behavior, was added to `yt-dlp` in version 2021.04.11. yt-dlp version 2024.04.09 fixes this issue by properly escaping `%`. It replaces them with `%%cd:~,%`, a variable that expands to nothing, leaving only the leading percent. It is recommended to upgrade yt-dlp to version 2024.04.09 as soon as possible. Also, always be careful when using `--exec`, because while this specific vulnerability has been patched, using unvalidated input in shell commands is inherently dangerous. For Windows users who are not able to upgrade, avoid using any output template expansion in `--exec` other than `{}` (filepath); if expansion in `--exec` is needed, verify the fields you are using do not contain `""`, `|` or `&`; and/or instead of using `--exec`, write the info json and load the fields from it instead."	8.3	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2024-24576	2024-04-09T18:15:08.420	2024-11-21T08:59:27.443	"Rust is a programming language. The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the Rust standard library prior to version 1.77.2 did not properly escape arguments when invoking batch files (with the `bat` and `cmd` extensions) on Windows using the `Command`. An attacker able to control the arguments passed to the spawned process could execute arbitrary shell commands by bypassing the escaping. The severity of this vulnerability is critical for those who invoke batch files on Windows with untrusted arguments. No other platform or use is affected.

The `Command::arg` and `Command::args` APIs state in their documentation that the arguments will be passed to the spawned process as-is, regardless of the content of the arguments, and will not be evaluated by a shell. This means it should be safe to pass untrusted input as an argument.

On Windows, the implementation of this is more complex than other platforms, because the Windows API only provides a single string containing all the arguments to the spawned process, and it's up to the spawned process to split them. Most programs use the standard C run-time argv, which in practice results in a mostly consistent way arguments are splitted.

One exception though is `cmd.exe` (used among other things to execute batch files), which has its own argument splitting logic. That forces the standard library to implement custom escaping for arguments passed to batch files. Unfortunately it was reported that our escaping logic was not thorough enough, and it was possible to pass malicious arguments that would result in arbitrary shell execution.

Due to the complexity of `cmd.exe`, we didn't identify a solution that would correctly escape arguments in all cases. To maintain our API guarantees, we improved the robustness of the escaping code, and changed the `Command` API to return an `InvalidInput` error when it cannot safely escape an argument. This error will be emitted when spawning the process.

The fix is included in Rust 1.77.2. Note that the new escaping logic for batch files errs on the conservative side, and could reject valid arguments. Those who implement the escaping themselves or only handle trusted inputs on Windows can also use the `CommandExt::raw_arg` method to bypass the standard library's escaping logic.

When building with CONFIG_XEN_PV=y, .text symbols are emitted into
the .notes section so that Xen can find the ""startup_xen"" entry point.
This information is used prior to booting the kernel, so relocations
are not useful. In fact, performing relocations against the .notes
section means that the KASLR base is exposed since /sys/kernel/notes
is world-readable.

To avoid leaking the KASLR base without breaking unprivileged tools that

scsi: core: Fix scsi_mode_sense() buffer length handling

Several problems exist with scsi_mode_sense() buffer length handling:

 1) The allocation length field of the MODE SENSE(10) command is 16-bits,
    occupying bytes 7 and 8 of the CDB. With this command, access to mode
    pages larger than 255 bytes is thus possible. However, the CDB
    allocation length field is set by assigning len to byte 8 only, thus
    truncating buffer length larger than 255.

 2) If scsi_mode_sense() is called with len smaller than 8 with
    sdev->use_10_for_ms set, or smaller than 4 otherwise, the buffer length
    is increased to 8 and 4 respectively, and the buffer is zero filled
    with these increased values, thus corrupting the memory following the
    buffer.

Fix these 2 problems by using put_unaligned_be16() to set the allocation
length field of MODE SENSE(10) CDB and by returning an error when len is
too small.

Furthermore, if len is larger than 255B, always try MODE SENSE(10) first,
even if the device driver did not set sdev->use_10_for_ms. In case of
invalid opcode error for MODE SENSE(10), access to mode pages larger than
255 bytes are not retried using MODE SENSE(6). To avoid buffer length
overflows for the MODE_SENSE(10) case, check that len is smaller than 65535
bytes.

While at it, also fix the folowing:

 * Use get_unaligned_be16() to retrieve the mode data length and block
   descriptor length fields of the mode sense reply header instead of using
   an open coded calculation.

 * Fix the kdoc dbd argument explanation: the DBD bit stands for Disable
   Block Descriptor, which is the opposite of what the dbd argument
   description was."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

The Link down processing results in ABTS requests for outstanding ELS

the link state to down. Thus the driver is sending the Abort with the
expectation that an ABTS will be sent on the wire. The Abort request is
stalled waiting for the link to come up. In some conditions the driver may
auto-complete the ELSs thus if the link does come up, the Abort completions

The entry/exit latency and minimum residency in state for the idle
states of MSM8998 were ..bad: first of all, for all of them the
timings were written for CPU sleep but the min-residency-us param
was miscalculated (supposedly, while porting this from downstream);
Then, the power collapse states are setting PC on both the CPU
cluster *and* the L2 cache, which have different timings: in the
specific case of L2 the times are higher so these ones should be
taken into account instead of the CPU ones.

This parameter misconfiguration was not giving particular issues
because on MSM8998 there was no CPU scaling at all, so cluster/L2
power collapse was rarely (if ever) hit.
When CPU scaling is enabled, though, the wrong timings will produce
SoC unstability shown to the user as random, apparently error-less,

encountered and this causes a memory leak. Modify the function to return
a success/error value and then free the memory if insertion didn't
happen.

v2. Adds a return -1 when the insertion error occurs in
    perf_env__fetch_btf. This doesn't affect anything as the result is
    never checked."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

scsi: core: sysfs: Fix hang when device state is set via sysfs

This fixes a regression added with:

commit f0f82e2476f6 (""scsi: core: Fix capacity set to zero after
offlinining device"")

The problem is that after iSCSI recovery, iscsid will call into the kernel
to set the dev's state to running, and with that patch we now call
scsi_rescan_device() with the state_mutex held. If the SCSI error handler
thread is just starting to test the device in scsi_send_eh_cmnd() then it's
going to try to grab the state_mutex.

We are then stuck, because when scsi_rescan_device() tries to send its I/O
scsi_queue_rq() calls -> scsi_host_queue_ready() -> scsi_host_in_recovery()
which will return true (the host state is still in recovery) and I/O will
just be requeued. scsi_send_eh_cmnd() will then never be able to grab the
state_mutex to finish error handling.

To prevent the deadlock move the rescan-related code to after we drop the
state_mutex.

This also adds a check for if we are already in the running state. This
prevents extra scans and helps the iscsid case where if the transport class
has already onlined the device during its recovery process then we don't
need userspace to do it again plus possibly block that daemon."	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

net/mlx5e: CT, Fix multiple allocations and memleak of mod acts

CT clear action offload adds additional mod hdr actions to the
flow's original mod actions in order to clear the registers which
hold ct_state.
When such flow also includes encap action, a neigh update event
can cause the driver to unoffload the flow and then reoffload it.

Each time this happens, the ct clear handling adds that same set
of mod hdr actions to reset ct_state until the max of mod hdr
actions is reached.

Also the driver never releases the allocated mod hdr actions and
causing a memleak.

Fix above two issues by moving CT clear mod acts allocation
into the parsing actions phase and only use it when offloading the rule.
The release of mod acts will be done in the normal flow_put().

string is set and a log message output.  The job is then added to a
completions list for cancellation.

of whether a wqe was passed to the adapter.  If successfully added to

Fix by clearing the fail_msg string after adding a job to the completions

clk: sunxi-ng: Unregister clocks/resets when unbinding

Currently, unbinding a CCU driver unmaps the device's MMIO region, while
leaving its clocks/resets and their providers registered. This can cause
a page fault later when some clock operation tries to perform MMIO. Fix
this by separating the CCU initialization from the memory allocation,
and then using a devres callback to unregister the clocks and resets.

This also fixes a memory leak of the `struct ccu_reset`, and uses the
correct owner (the specific platform driver) for the clocks and resets.

Early OF clock providers are never unregistered, and limited error
handling is possible, so they are mostly unchanged. The error reporting

sched/fair: Prevent dead task groups from regaining cfs_rq's

Kevin is reporting crashes which point to a use-after-free of a cfs_rq
in update_blocked_averages(). Initial debugging revealed that we've
live cfs_rq's (on_list=1) in an about to be kfree()'d task group in
free_fair_sched_group(). However, it was unclear how that can happen.

His kernel config happened to lead to a layout of struct sched_entity
that put the 'my_q' member directly into the middle of the object
which makes it incidentally overlap with SLUB's freelist pointer.
That, in combination with SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED's freelist pointer
mangling, leads to a reliable access violation in form of a #GP which
made the UAF fail fast.

Michal seems to have run into the same issue[1]. He already correctly
diagnosed that commit a7b359fc6a37 (""sched/fair: Correctly insert
cfs_rq's to list on unthrottle"") is causing the preconditions for the
UAF to happen by re-adding cfs_rq's also to task groups that have no
more running tasks, i.e. also to dead ones. His analysis, however,
misses the real root cause and it cannot be seen from the crash
backtrace only, as the real offender is tg_unthrottle_up() getting
called via sched_cfs_period_timer() via the timer interrupt at an
inconvenient time.

When unregister_fair_sched_group() unlinks all cfs_rq's from the dying
task group, it doesn't protect itself from getting interrupted. If the
timer interrupt triggers while we iterate over all CPUs or after
unregister_fair_sched_group() has finished but prior to unlinking the
task group, sched_cfs_period_timer() will execute and walk the list of
task groups, trying to unthrottle cfs_rq's, i.e. re-add them to the
dying task group. These will later -- in free_fair_sched_group() -- be
kfree()'ed while still being linked, leading to the fireworks Kevin
and Michal are seeing.

To fix this race, ensure the dying task group gets unlinked first.
However, simply switching the order of unregistering and unlinking the
task group isn't sufficient, as concurrent RCU walkers might still see
it, as can be seen below:

CVE-2024-31464	2024-04-10T19:15:49.413	2025-01-09T16:41:19.137	XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 5.0-rc-1 and prior to versions 14.10.19, 15.5.4, and 15.9-rc-1, it is possible to access the hash of a password by using the diff feature of the history whenever the object storing the password is deleted. Using that vulnerability it's possible for an attacker to have access to the hash password of a user if they have rights to edit the users' page.  With the default right scheme in XWiki this vulnerability is normally prevented on user profiles, except by users with Admin rights. Note that this vulnerability also impacts any extensions that might use passwords stored in xobjects: for those usecases it depends on the right of those pages. There is currently no way to be 100% sure that this vulnerability has been exploited, as an attacker with enough privilege could have deleted the revision where the xobject was deleted after rolling-back the deletion. But again, this operation requires high privileges on the target page (Admin right). A page with a user password xobject which have in its history a revision where the object has been deleted should be considered at risk and the password should be changed there. a diff, to ensure it's not coming from a password field. As another mitigation, admins should ensure that the user pages are properly protected: the edit right shouldn't be allowed for other users than Admin and owner of the profile (which is the default right). There is not much workaround possible for a privileged user other than upgrading XWiki.	6.8	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

At the end of the request handling, it will encrypt all data in the session with a secret key and attach the ciphertext as a cookie value with the defined cookie name. After that, the session on the server side is destroyed. When an encrypted cookie with matching session name is provided with subsequent requests, it will decrypt the ciphertext to get the data. The plugin then creates a new session with the data in the ciphertext. Thus theoretically the web instance is still accessing the data from a server-side session, but technically that session is generated solely from a user provided cookie (which is assumed to be non-craftable because it is encrypted with a secret key not known to the user). The issue exists in the session removal process. In the delete function of the code, when the session is deleted, it is marked for deletion. However, if an attacker could gain access to the cookie, they could keep using it forever. Version 7.3.0 contains a patch for the issue.

CVE-2024-29902	2024-04-10T23:15:06.920	2025-01-09T15:56:50.707	Cosign provides code signing and transparency for containers and binaries. Prior to version 2.2.4, a remote image with a malicious attachment can cause denial of service of the host machine running Cosign. This can impact other services on the machine that rely on having memory available such as a Redis database which can result in data loss. It can also impact the availability of other services on the machine that will not be available for the duration of the machine denial. The root cause of this issue is that Cosign reads the attachment from a remote image entirely into memory without checking the size of the attachment first. As such, a large attachment can make Cosign read a large attachment into memory; If the attachments size is larger than the machine has memory available, the machine will be denied of service. The Go runtime will make a SigKill after a few seconds of system-wide denial. This issue can allow a supply-chain escalation from a compromised registry to the Cosign user: If an attacher has compromised a registry or the account of an image vendor, they can include a malicious attachment and hurt the image consumer. Version 2.2.4 contains a patch for the vulnerability.	4.2	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2024-29903	2024-04-10T23:15:07.130	2025-01-09T15:40:24.663	Cosign provides code signing and transparency for containers and binaries. Prior to version 2.2.4, maliciously-crafted software artifacts can cause denial of service of the machine running Cosign thereby impacting all services on the machine. The root cause is that Cosign creates slices based on the number of signatures, manifests or attestations in untrusted artifacts. As such, the untrusted artifact can control the amount of memory that Cosign allocates. The exact issue is Cosign allocates excessive memory on the lines that creates a slice of the same length as the manifests. Version 2.2.4 contains a patch for the vulnerability.	4.2	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Use of a relation of the form: `relation folder: folder | folder#parent` with an arrow such as `folder->view` can cause LookupSubjects to only return the subjects found under subjects for either `folder` or `folder#parent`. This bug only manifests if the same subject type is used multiple types in a relation, relationships exist for both subject types and an arrow is used over the relation.

CVE-2024-27309	2024-04-12T07:15:08.560	2025-06-10T00:59:50.953	"While an Apache Kafka cluster is being migrated from ZooKeeper mode to KRaft mode, in some cases ACLs will not be correctly enforced.

Two preconditions are needed to trigger the bug:
1. The administrator decides to remove an ACL
2. The resource associated with the removed ACL continues to have two or more other ACLs associated with it after the removal.

When those two preconditions are met, Kafka will treat the resource as if it had only one ACL associated with it after the removal, rather than the two or more that would be correct.

The incorrect condition is cleared by removing all brokers in ZK mode, or by adding a new ACL to the affected resource. Once the migration is completed, there is no metadata loss (the ACLs all remain).

The full impact depends on the ACLs in use. If only ALLOW ACLs were configured during the migration, the impact would be limited to availability impact. if DENY ACLs were configured, the impact could include confidentiality and integrity impact depending on the ACLs configured, as the DENY ACLs might be ignored due to this vulnerability during the migration period."	7.4	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

This issue affects all versions of the Apache Solr Operator from 0.3.0 through 0.8.0.

When asked to bootstrap Solr security, the operator will enable basic authentication and create several accounts for accessing Solr: including the ""solr"" and ""admin"" accounts for use by end-users, and a ""k8s-oper"" account which the operator uses for its own requests to Solr.
One common source of these operator requests is healthchecks: liveness, readiness, and startup probes are all used to determine Solr's health and ability to receive traffic.
By default, the operator configures the Solr APIs used for these probes to be exempt from authentication, but users may specifically request that authentication be required on probe endpoints as well.
Whenever one of these probes would fail, if authentication was in use, the Solr Operator would create a Kubernetes ""event"" containing the username and password of the ""k8s-oper"" account.

Within the affected version range, this vulnerability affects any solrcloud resource which (1) bootstrapped security through use of the `.solrOptions.security.authenticationType=basic` option, and (2) required authentication be used on probes by setting `.solrOptions.security.probesRequireAuth=true`.

Users are recommended to upgrade to Solr Operator version 0.8.1, which fixes this issue by ensuring that probes no longer print the credentials used for Solr requests.  Users may also mitigate the vulnerability by disabling authentication on their healthcheck probes using the setting `.solrOptions.security.probesRequireAuth=false`."	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVE-2024-32003	2024-04-12T21:15:11.617	2024-11-21T09:14:19.453	wn-dusk-plugin (Dusk plugin) is a plugin which integrates Laravel Dusk browser testing into Winter CMS. The Dusk plugin provides some special routes as part of its testing framework to allow a browser environment (such as headless Chrome) to act as a user in the Backend or User plugin without having to go through authentication. This route is `[[URL]]/_dusk/login/[[USER ID]]/[[MANAGER]]` - where `[[URL]]` is the base URL of the site, `[[USER ID]]` is the ID of the user account and `[[MANAGER]]` is the authentication manager (either `backend` for Backend, or `user` for the User plugin). If a configuration of a site using the Dusk plugin is set up in such a way that the Dusk plugin is available publicly and the test cases in Dusk are run with live data, this route may potentially be used to gain access to any user account in either the Backend or User plugin without authentication. As indicated in the `README`, this plugin should only be used in development and should *NOT* be used in a production instance. It is specifically recommended that the plugin be installed as a development dependency only in Composer. In order to remediate this issue, the special routes used above will now no longer be registered unless the `APP_ENV` environment variable is specifically set to `dusk`. Since Winter by default does not use this environment variable and it is not populated by default, it will only exist if Dusk's automatic configuration is used (which won't exhibit this vulnerability) or if a developer manually specifies it in their configuration. The automatic configuration performed by the Dusk plugin has also been hardened by default to use sane defaults and not allow external environment variables to leak into this configuration. This will only affect users in which the Winter CMS installation meets ALL the following criteria: 1. The Dusk plugin is installed in the Winter CMS instance. 2. The application is in production mode (ie. the `debug` config value is set to `true` in `config/app.php`). 3. The Dusk plugin's automatic configuration has been overridden, either by providing a custom `.env.dusk` file or by providing custom configuration in the `config/dusk` folder, or by providing configuration environment variables externally. 4. The environment has been configured to use production data in the database for testing, and not the temporary SQLite database that Dusk uses by default. 5. The application is connectable via the web. This issue has been fixed in version 2.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade.	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

These attributes are defined by the Semantic Conventions for HTTP Spans. Up until version `1.8.1` the values written by `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` will pass-through the raw query string as was sent or received (respectively). This may lead to sensitive information (e.g. EUII - End User Identifiable Information, credentials, etc.) being leaked into telemetry backends (depending on the application(s) being instrumented) which could cause privacy and/or security incidents.

This is especially important in a scenario where an adversary is able to read messages signed by PuTTY or Pageant. The required set of signed messages may be publicly readable because they are stored in a public Git service that supports use of SSH for commit signing, and the signatures were made by Pageant through an agent-forwarding mechanism. In other words, an adversary may already have enough signature information to compromise a victim's private key, even if there is no further use of vulnerable PuTTY versions. After a key compromise, an adversary may be able to conduct supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. A second, independent scenario is that the adversary is an operator of an SSH server to which the victim authenticates (for remote login or file copy), even though this server is not fully trusted by the victim, and the victim uses the same private key for SSH connections to other services operated by other entities. Here, the rogue server operator (who would otherwise have no way to determine the victim's private key) can derive the victim's private key, and then use it for unauthorized access to those other services. If the other services include Git services, then again it may be possible to conduct supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. This also affects, for example, FileZilla before 3.67.0, WinSCP before 6.3.3, TortoiseGit before 2.15.0.1, and TortoiseSVN through 1.14.6.	5.9	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVE-2024-1561	2024-04-16T00:15:08.887	2025-07-30T14:48:04.053	An issue was discovered in gradio-app/gradio, where the `/component_server` endpoint improperly allows the invocation of any method on a `Component` class with attacker-controlled arguments. Specifically, by exploiting the `move_resource_to_block_cache()` method of the `Block` class, an attacker can copy any file on the filesystem to a temporary directory and subsequently retrieve it. This vulnerability enables unauthorized local file read access, posing a significant risk especially when the application is exposed to the internet via `launch(share=True)`, thereby allowing remote attackers to read files on the host machine. Furthermore, gradio apps hosted on `huggingface.co` are also affected, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive information such as API keys and credentials stored in environment variables.					
CVE-2024-1569	2024-04-16T00:15:09.060	2025-07-07T15:52:34.137	parisneo/lollms-webui is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to uncontrolled resource consumption. Attackers can exploit the `/open_code_in_vs_code` and similar endpoints without authentication by sending repeated HTTP POST requests, leading to the opening of Visual Studio Code or the default folder opener (e.g., File Explorer, xdg-open) multiple times. This can render the host machine unusable by exhausting system resources. The vulnerability is present in the latest version of the software.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Those who must use SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c should use a complex community string and enhance the protection by restricting access to a given IP address range.

CVE-2024-30378	2024-04-16T20:15:09.680	2025-04-11T14:47:42.487	"A Use After Free vulnerability in command processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series allows a local, authenticated attacker to cause the broadband edge service manager daemon (bbe-smgd) to crash upon execution of specific CLI commands, creating a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.  The process crashes and restarts automatically.

When specific CLI commands are executed, the bbe-smgd daemon attempts to write into an area of memory (mgd socket) that was already closed, causing the process to crash.  This process manages and controls the configuration of broadband subscriber sessions and services.  While the process is unavailable, additional subscribers will not be able to connect to the device, causing a temporary Denial of Service condition.

This issue only occurs if Graceful Routing Engine Switchover (GRES) and Subscriber Management are enabled.

acquiring unneeded locks, it first try to check if any unacked data

Recently, handshake_req_destroy_test1 started failing:

Expected handshake_req_destroy_test == req, but

    req == 0000000060f99b40

This is because ""sock_release(sock)"" was replaced with ""fput(filp)""
to address a memory leak. Note that sock_release() is synchronous
but fput() usually delays the final close and clean-up.

The delay is not consequential in the other cases that were changed
but handshake_req_destroy_test1 is testing that handshake_req_cancel()
followed by closing the file actually does call the ->hp_destroy
method. Thus the PTR_EQ test at the end has to be sure that the
final close is complete before it checks the pointer.

We cannot use a completion here because if ->hp_destroy is never
called (ie, there is an API bug) then the test will hang.

net: bridge: switchdev: Skip MDB replays of deferred events on offload

Before this change, generation of the list of MDB events to replay
would race against the creation of new group memberships, either from
the IGMP/MLD snooping logic or from user configuration.

While new memberships are immediately visible to walkers of
br->mdb_list, the notification of their existence to switchdev event
subscribers is deferred until a later point in time. So if a replay
list was generated during a time that overlapped with such a window,
it would also contain a replay of the not-yet-delivered event.

The driver would thus receive two copies of what the bridge internally
considered to be one single event. On destruction of the bridge, only
a single membership deletion event was therefore sent. As a
consequence of this, drivers which reference count memberships (at
least DSA), would be left with orphan groups in their hardware
database when the bridge was destroyed.

This is only an issue when replaying additions. While deletion events
may still be pending on the deferred queue, they will already have
been removed from br->mdb_list, so no duplicates can be generated in
that scenario.

To a user this meant that old group memberships, from a bridge in
which a port was previously attached, could be reanimated (in
hardware) when the port joined a new bridge, without the new bridge's
knowledge.

For example, on an mv88e6xxx system, create a snooping bridge and
immediately add a port to it:

    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ ip link add dev br0 up type bridge mcast_snooping 1 && \
    > ip link set dev x3 up master br0

And then destroy the bridge:

    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ ip link del dev br0
    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ mvls atu
    ADDRESS             FID  STATE      Q  F  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a
    DEV:0 Marvell 88E6393X
    33:33:00:00:00:6a     1  static     -  -  0  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
    33:33:ff:87:e4:3f     1  static     -  -  0  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
    ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff     1  static     -  -  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a
    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$

The two IPv6 groups remain in the hardware database because the
port (x3) is notified of the host's membership twice: once via the
original event and once via a replay. Since only a single delete
notification is sent, the count remains at 1 when the bridge is
destroyed.

Then add the same port (or another port belonging to the same hardware
domain) to a new bridge, this time with snooping disabled:

    root@infix-06-0b-00:~$ ip link add dev br1 up type bridge mcast_snooping 0 && \
    > ip link set dev x3 up master br1

All multicast, including the two IPv6 groups from br0, should now be
flooded, according to the policy of br1. But instead the old
memberships are still active in the hardware database, causing the
switch to only forward traffic to those groups towards the CPU (port
0).

Eliminate the race in two steps:

1. Grab the write-side lock of the MDB while generating the replay
   list.

This prevents new memberships from showing up while we are generating
the replay list. But it leaves the scenario in which a deferred event
was already generated, but not delivered, before we grabbed the
lock. Therefore:

2. Make sure that no deferred version of a replay event is already
   enqueued to the switchdev deferred queue, before adding it to the
   replay list, when replaying additions."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

block: Fix WARNING in _copy_from_iter

Syzkaller reports a warning in _copy_from_iter because an
iov_iter is supposedly used in the wrong direction. The reason
is that syzcaller managed to generate a request with
a transfer direction of SG_DXFER_TO_FROM_DEV. This instructs
the kernel to copy user buffers into the kernel, read into
the copied buffers and then copy the data back to user space.

Thus the iovec is used in both directions.

nvme-fc: do not wait in vain when unloading module

The module exit path has race between deleting all controllers and
freeing 'left over IDs'. To prevent double free a synchronization
between nvme_delete_ctrl and ida_destroy has been added by the initial
commit.

There is some logic around trying to prevent from hanging forever in
wait_for_completion, though it does not handling all cases. E.g.
blktests is able to reproduce the situation where the module unload
hangs forever.

If we completely rely on the cleanup code executed from the
nvme_delete_ctrl path, all IDs will be freed eventually. This makes
calling ida_destroy unnecessary. We only have to ensure that all
nvme_delete_ctrl code has been executed before we leave
nvme_fc_exit_module. This is done by flushing the nvme_delete_wq
workqueue.

While at it, remove the unused nvme_fc_wq workqueue too."	4.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-26853	2024-04-17T11:15:08.583	2025-04-02T13:17:04.977	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

igc: avoid returning frame twice in XDP_REDIRECT

When a frame can not be transmitted in XDP_REDIRECT
(e.g. due to a full queue), it is necessary to free
it by calling xdp_return_frame_rx_napi.

However, this is the responsibility of the caller of
the ndo_xdp_xmit (see for example bq_xmit_all in
kernel/bpf/devmap.c) and thus calling it inside
igc_xdp_xmit (which is the ndo_xdp_xmit of the igc
driver) as well will lead to memory corruption.

In fact, bq_xmit_all expects that it can return all
frames after the last successfully transmitted one.
Therefore, break for the first not transmitted frame,
but do not call xdp_return_frame_rx_napi in igc_xdp_xmit.
This is equally implemented in other Intel drivers
such as the igb.

There are two alternatives to this that were rejected:
1. Return num_frames as all the frames would have been
   transmitted and release them inside igc_xdp_xmit.
   While it might work technically, it is not what
   the return value is meant to represent (i.e. the
   number of SUCCESSFULLY transmitted packets).
2. Rework kernel/bpf/devmap.c and all drivers to
   support non-consecutively dropped packets.
   Besides being complex, it likely has a negative
   performance impact without a significant gain
   since it is anyway unlikely that the next frame
   can be transmitted if the previous one was dropped.

Issue is similar to the one I fixed in commit 8d975c15c0cd

We have to save skb->network_header in a temporary variable

pskb_inet_may_pull() makes sure the needed headers are in skb->head.

If the packet type ID field in the Ethernet header is either ETH_P_PRP or
ETH_P_HSR, but it is not followed by an HSR tag, hsr_get_skb_sequence_nr()

tcp: Fix refcnt handling in __inet_hash_connect().

syzbot reported a warning in sk_nulls_del_node_init_rcu().

The commit 66b60b0c8c4a (""dccp/tcp: Unhash sk from ehash for tb2 alloc
failure after check_estalblished()."") tried to fix an issue that an
unconnected socket occupies an ehash entry when bhash2 allocation fails.

In such a case, we need to revert changes done by check_established(),
which does not hold refcnt when inserting socket into ehash.

So, to revert the change, we need to __sk_nulls_add_node_rcu() instead
of sk_nulls_add_node_rcu().

Otherwise, sock_put() will cause refcnt underflow and leak the socket.

CVE-2024-26865	2024-04-17T11:15:09.207	2025-01-07T17:14:10.927	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rds: tcp: Fix use-after-free of net in reqsk_timer_handler().

syzkaller reported a warning of netns tracker [0] followed by KASAN
splat [1] and another ref tracker warning [1].

syzkaller could not find a repro, but in the log, the only suspicious
sequence was as follows:

  18:26:22 executing program 1:
  r0 = socket$inet6_mptcp(0xa, 0x1, 0x106)
  ...
  connect$inet6(r0, &(0x7f0000000080)={0xa, 0x4001, 0x0, @loopback}, 0x1c) (async)

The notable thing here is 0x4001 in connect(), which is RDS_TCP_PORT.

So, the scenario would be:

  1. unshare(CLONE_NEWNET) creates a per netns tcp listener in
      rds_tcp_listen_init().
  2. syz-executor connect()s to it and creates a reqsk.
  3. syz-executor exit()s immediately.
  4. netns is dismantled.  [0]
  5. reqsk timer is fired, and UAF happens while freeing reqsk.  [1]
  6. listener is freed after RCU grace period.  [2]

Basically, reqsk assumes that the listener guarantees netns safety
until all reqsk timers are expired by holding the listener's refcount.
However, this was not the case for kernel sockets.

Commit 740ea3c4a0b2 (""tcp: Clean up kernel listener's reqsk in
inet_twsk_purge()"") fixed this issue only for per-netns ehash.

Let's apply the same fix for the global ehash.

comedi: comedi_8255: Correct error in subdevice initialization

The refactoring done in commit 5c57b1ccecc7 (""comedi: comedi_8255: Rework
subdevice initialization functions"") to the initialization of the io
field of struct subdev_8255_private broke all cards using the
drivers/comedi/drivers/comedi_8255.c module.

Prior to 5c57b1ccecc7, __subdev_8255_init() initialized the io field
in the newly allocated struct subdev_8255_private to the non-NULL
callback given to the function, otherwise it used a flag parameter to
select between subdev_8255_mmio and subdev_8255_io. The refactoring
removed that logic and the flag, as subdev_8255_mm_init() and
subdev_8255_io_init() now explicitly pass subdev_8255_mmio and
subdev_8255_io respectively to __subdev_8255_init(), only
__subdev_8255_init() never sets spriv->io to the supplied
callback. That spriv->io is NULL leads to a later BUG:

  #0 at 0xffffffffa079657a (ff_layout_cancel_io+0x3a/0x84) in ff_layout_cancel_io at fs/nfs/flexfilelayout/flexfilelayout.c:2021:27

  >>> prog.crashed_thread().stack_trace()[0]['flseg'].mirror_array[1].mirror_ds
  (struct nfs4_ff_layout_ds *)0xffffffffffffffed

This is clear from the stack trace, we call nfs4_ff_layout_prepare_ds()
which could error out initializing the mirror_ds, and then we go to
clean it all up and our check is only for if (!mirror->mirror_ds).  This
is inconsistent with the rest of the users of mirror_ds, which have

  if (IS_ERR_OR_NULL(mirror_ds))

to keep from tripping over this exact scenario.  Fix this up in
ff_layout_cancel_io() to make sure we don't panic when we get an error.
I also spot checked all the other instances of checking mirror_ds and we
appear to be doing the correct checks everywhere, only unconditionally
dereferencing mirror_ds when we know it would be valid."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

f2fs: fix to truncate meta inode pages forcely

Below race case can cause data corruption:

Thread A				GC thread

- f2fs_inplace_write_data
 - invalidate_mapping_pages

Because invalidate_mapping_pages() will skip invalidating page which

we need to use truncate_inode_pages_range() instead of

A call to listxattr() with a buffer size = 0 returns the actual

This is because when the device goes offline, we obtain the hisi_hba
semaphore and send the ABORT_DEV command to the device. However, the
internal abort timed out due to the 2 bit ECC error and triggers automatic
dump. In addition, since the hisi_hba semaphore has been obtained, the dump
cannot be executed and the controller cannot be reset.

Therefore, the deadlocks occur on the following circular dependencies

drm/mediatek: Fix a null pointer crash in mtk_drm_crtc_finish_page_flip

It's possible that mtk_crtc->event is NULL in
mtk_drm_crtc_finish_page_flip().

pending_needs_vblank value is set by mtk_crtc->event, but in
mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_flush(), it's is not guarded by the same
lock in mtk_drm_finish_page_flip(), thus a race condition happens.

Consider the following case:

CPU1                              CPU2
step 1:
mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_begin()
mtk_crtc->event is not null,
                                  step 1:
                                  mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_flush:
                                  mtk_drm_crtc_update_config(
                                      !!mtk_crtc->event)
step 2:
mtk_crtc_ddp_irq ->
mtk_drm_finish_page_flip:
lock
mtk_crtc->event set to null,
pending_needs_vblank set to false
unlock
                                  pending_needs_vblank set to true,

                                  step 2:
                                  mtk_crtc_ddp_irq ->
                                  mtk_drm_finish_page_flip called again,
                                  pending_needs_vblank is still true
                                  //null pointer

dm: call the resume method on internal suspend

There is this reported crash when experimenting with the lvm2 testsuite.
The list corruption is caused by the fact that the postsuspend and resume
methods were not paired correctly; there were two consecutive calls to the
origin_postsuspend function. The second call attempts to remove the
""hash_list"" entry from a list, while it was already removed by the first
call.

Fix __dm_internal_resume so that it calls the preresume and resume
methods of the table's targets.

If a preresume method of some target fails, we are in a tricky situation.
We can't return an error because dm_internal_resume isn't supposed to
return errors. We can't return success, because then the ""resume"" and
""postsuspend"" methods would not be paired correctly. So, we set the
DMF_SUSPENDED flag and we fake normal suspend - it may confuse userspace
tools, but it won't cause a kernel crash.

bpf: Fix stackmap overflow check on 32-bit arches

The stackmap code relies on roundup_pow_of_two() to compute the number
of hash buckets, and contains an overflow check by checking if the
resulting value is 0. However, on 32-bit arches, the roundup code itself
can overflow by doing a 32-bit left-shift of an unsigned long value,
which is undefined behaviour, so it is not guaranteed to truncate
neatly. This was triggered by syzbot on the DEVMAP_HASH type, which
contains the same check, copied from the hashtab code.

The commit in the fixes tag actually attempted to fix this, but the fix
did not account for the UB, so the fix only works on CPUs where an
overflow does result in a neat truncation to zero, which is not
guaranteed. Checking the value before rounding does not have this
problem."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

bpf: Fix DEVMAP_HASH overflow check on 32-bit arches

The devmap code allocates a number hash buckets equal to the next power
of two of the max_entries value provided when creating the map. When
rounding up to the next power of two, the 32-bit variable storing the
number of buckets can overflow, and the code checks for overflow by
checking if the truncated 32-bit value is equal to 0. However, on 32-bit
arches the rounding up itself can overflow mid-way through, because it
ends up doing a left-shift of 32 bits on an unsigned long value. If the
size of an unsigned long is four bytes, this is undefined behaviour, so
there is no guarantee that we'll end up with a nice and tidy 0-value at
the end.

Syzbot managed to turn this into a crash on arm32 by creating a
DEVMAP_HASH with max_entries > 0x80000000 and then trying to update it.

Bluetooth: btrtl: fix out of bounds memory access

The problem is detected by KASAN.
btrtl driver uses private hci data to store 'struct btrealtek_data'.
If btrtl driver is used with btusb, then memory for private hci data
is allocated in btusb. But no private data is allocated after hci_dev,
when btrtl is used with hci_h5.

This commit adds memory allocation for hci_h5 case.

From commit a304e1b82808 (""[PATCH] Debug shared irqs""), there is a test

firmware: arm_scmi: Fix double free in SMC transport cleanup path

When the generic SCMI code tears down a channel, it calls the chan_free

clean up the same member multiple times within the given SCMI transport

David Mosberger-Tan initial investigation [1] showed that this
use-after-free is due to netdevice unregistration during vif list
traversal. When unregistering a net device, since the needs_free_netdev has
been set to true during registration, the netdevice object is also freed,
and as a consequence, the corresponding vif object too, since it is
attached to it as private netdevice data. The next occurrence of the loop
then tries to access freed vif pointer to the list to move forward in the
list.

Fix this use-after-free thanks to two mechanisms:
- navigate in the list with list_for_each_entry_safe, which allows to
  safely modify the list as we go through each element. For each element,
  remove it from the list with list_del_rcu
- make sure to wait for RCU grace period end after each vif removal to make
  sure it is safe to free the corresponding vif too (through
  unregister_netdev)

Since we are in a RCU ""modifier"" path (not a ""reader"" path), and because
such path is expected not to be concurrent to any other modifier (we are
using the vif_mutex lock), we do not need to use RCU list API, that's why
we can benefit from list_for_each_entry_safe.

wifi: ath9k: delay all of ath9k_wmi_event_tasklet() until init is complete

The ath9k_wmi_event_tasklet() used in ath9k_htc assumes that all the data
structures have been fully initialised by the time it runs. However, because of
the order in which things are initialised, this is not guaranteed to be the
case, because the device is exposed to the USB subsystem before the ath9k driver
initialisation is completed.

We already committed a partial fix for this in commit:
8b3046abc99e (""ath9k_htc: fix NULL pointer dereference at ath9k_htc_tx_get_packet()"")

However, that commit only aborted the WMI_TXSTATUS_EVENTID command in the event
tasklet, pairing it with an ""initialisation complete"" bit in the TX struct. It
seems syzbot managed to trigger the race for one of the other commands as well,
so let's just move the existing synchronisation bit to cover the whole
tasklet (setting it at the end of ath9k_htc_probe_device() instead of inside
ath9k_tx_init())."

aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pkts

This patch is against CVE-2023-6270. The description of cve is:

  A flaw was found in the ATA over Ethernet (AoE) driver in the Linux
  kernel. The aoecmd_cfg_pkts() function improperly updates the refcnt on
  `struct net_device`, and a use-after-free can be triggered by racing
  between the free on the struct and the access through the `skbtxq`
  global queue. This could lead to a denial of service condition or
  potential code execution.

In aoecmd_cfg_pkts(), it always calls dev_put(ifp) when skb initial
code is finished. But the net_device ifp will still be used in
later tx()->dev_queue_xmit() in kthread. Which means that the
dev_put(ifp) should NOT be called in the success path of skb
initial code in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). Otherwise tx() may run into
use-after-free because the net_device is freed.

This patch removed the dev_put(ifp) in the success path in
aoecmd_cfg_pkts(), and added dev_put() after skb xmit in tx()."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

block: fix deadlock between bd_link_disk_holder and partition scan

'open_mutex' of gendisk is used to protect open/close block devices. But
in bd_link_disk_holder(), it is used to protect the creation of symlink
between holding disk and slave bdev, which introduces some issues.

When bd_link_disk_holder() is called, the driver is usually in the process
of initialization/modification and may suspend submitting io. At this
time, any io hold 'open_mutex', such as scanning partitions, can cause
deadlocks. For example, in raid:

T1                              T2
bdev_open_by_dev

    md_handle_request
     -> wait mddev_resume

T1 scan partition, T2 add a new device to raid. T1 waits for T2 to resume
mddev, but T2 waits for open_mutex held by T1. Deadlock occurs.

Fix it by introducing a local mutex 'blk_holder_mutex' to replace
'open_mutex'."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Bluetooth: rfcomm: Fix null-ptr-deref in rfcomm_check_security

During our fuzz testing of the connection and disconnection process at the
RFCOMM layer, we discovered this bug. By comparing the packets from a
normal connection and disconnection process with the testcase that
triggered a KASAN report. We analyzed the cause of this bug as follows:

1. In the packets captured during a normal connection, the host sends a
`Read Encryption Key Size` type of `HCI_CMD` packet
(Command Opcode: 0x1408) to the controller to inquire the length of
encryption key.After receiving this packet, the controller immediately
replies with a Command Completepacket (Event Code: 0x0e) to return the
Encryption Key Size.

2. In our fuzz test case, the timing of the controller's response to this
packet was delayed to an unexpected point: after the RFCOMM and L2CAP
layers had disconnected but before the HCI layer had disconnected.

3. After receiving the Encryption Key Size Response at the time described
in point 2, the host still called the rfcomm_check_security function.
However, by this time `struct l2cap_conn *conn = l2cap_pi(sk)->chan->conn;`
had already been released, and when the function executed
`return hci_conn_security(conn->hcon, d->sec_level, auth_type, d->out);`,
specifically when accessing `conn->hcon`, a null-ptr-deref error occurred.

To fix this bug, check if `sk->sk_state` is BT_CLOSED before calling

The oops is triggered when:

1) A bpf program uses bpf_probe_read_kernel() to read from the vsyscall
page and invokes copy_from_kernel_nofault() which in turn calls
__get_user_asm().

2) Because the vsyscall page address is not readable from kernel space,
a page fault exception is triggered accordingly.

3) handle_page_fault() considers the vsyscall page address as a user
space address instead of a kernel space address. This results in the
fix-up setup by bpf not being applied and a page_fault_oops() is invoked
due to SMAP.

Considering handle_page_fault() has already considered the vsyscall page
address as a userspace address, fix the problem by disallowing vsyscall
page read for copy_from_kernel_nofault()."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-26908	2024-04-17T11:15:11.310	2024-04-30T08:15:17.140	Rejected reason: This CVE ID has been rejected or withdrawn by its CVE Numbering Authority.					
CVE-2024-26909	2024-04-17T11:15:11.360	2024-11-21T09:03:21.497	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soc: qcom: pmic_glink_altmode: fix drm bridge use-after-free

A recent DRM series purporting to simplify support for ""transparent
bridges"" and handling of probe deferrals ironically exposed a
use-after-free issue on pmic_glink_altmode probe deferral.

This has manifested itself as the display subsystem occasionally failing
to initialise and NULL-pointer dereferences during boot of machines like
the Lenovo ThinkPad X13s.

Specifically, the dp-hpd bridge is currently registered before all
resources have been acquired which means that it can also be
deregistered on probe deferrals.

In the meantime there is a race window where the new aux bridge driver
(or PHY driver previously) may have looked up the dp-hpd bridge and
stored a (non-reference-counted) pointer to the bridge which is about to
be deallocated.

When the display controller is later initialised, this triggers a
use-after-free when attaching the bridges:

	dp -> aux -> dp-hpd (freed)

which may, for example, result in the freed bridge failing to attach:

	[drm:drm_bridge_attach [drm]] *ERROR* failed to attach bridge /soc@0/phy@88eb000 to encoder TMDS-31: -16

or a NULL-pointer dereference:

	Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000
	...
	Call trace:
	  drm_bridge_attach+0x70/0x1a8 [drm]
	  drm_aux_bridge_attach+0x24/0x38 [aux_bridge]
	  drm_bridge_attach+0x80/0x1a8 [drm]
	  dp_bridge_init+0xa8/0x15c [msm]
	  msm_dp_modeset_init+0x28/0xc4 [msm]

The DRM bridge implementation is clearly fragile and implicitly built on
the assumption that bridges may never go away. In this case, the fix is
to move the bridge registration in the pmic_glink_altmode driver to
after all resources have been looked up.

Incidentally, with the new dp-hpd bridge implementation, which registers
child devices, this is also a requirement due to a long-standing issue
in driver core that can otherwise lead to a probe deferral loop (see
commit fbc35b45f9f6 (""Add documentation on meaning of -EPROBE_DEFER"")).

PCI: Fix active state requirement in PME polling

The commit noted in fixes added a bogus requirement that runtime PM managed
devices need to be in the RPM_ACTIVE state for PME polling.  In fact, only
devices in low power states should be polled.

However there's still a requirement that the device config space must be
accessible, which has implications for both the current state of the polled
device and the parent bridge, when present.  It's not sufficient to assume
the bridge remains in D0 and cases have been observed where the bridge
passes the D0 test, but the PM state indicates RPM_SUSPENDING and config
space of the polled device becomes inaccessible during pci_pme_wakeup().

Therefore, since the bridge is already effectively required to be in the
RPM_ACTIVE state, formalize this in the code and elevate the PM usage count
to maintain the state while polling the subordinate device.

This resolves a regression reported in the bugzilla below where a
Thunderbolt/USB4 hierarchy fails to scan for an attached NVMe endpoint

When the reverse proxy mode is enabled by the `IRONIC_REVERSE_PROXY_SETUP` variable set to `true`, 1) HTTP basic credentials are validated on the HTTPD side in a separate container, not in the Ironic service itself and 2) Ironic listens in host network on a private port 6388 on localhost by default. As a result, when the reverse proxy mode is used, any Pod or local Unix user on the control plane Node can access the Ironic API on the private port without authentication. A similar problem affects Ironic Inspector (`INSPECTOR_REVERSE_PROXY_SETUP` set to `true`), although the attack potential is smaller there. This issue affects operators deploying ironic-image in the reverse proxy mode, which is the recommended mode when TLS is used (also recommended), with the `IRONIC_PRIVATE_PORT` variable unset or set to a numeric value. In this case, an attacker with enough privileges to launch a pod on the control plane with host networking can access Ironic API and use it to modify bare-metal machine, e.g. provision them with a new image or change their BIOS settings.

This allows arbitrary JavaScript to be run in the context of the domain where the editor is hosted. There were two vectors. One rendering untrusted string as iframe's `srcdoc` without properly sanitizing against HTML injection. Second by improperly sanitizing against attribute HTML injection. This in conjunction with allowing `allow-same-origin` sandbox flag (necessary for several embeds) resulted in the XSS. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.17.6 and 0.16.4.	6.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

CVE-2024-26921	2024-04-18T10:15:07.740	2025-09-16T17:03:13.503	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

inet: inet_defrag: prevent sk release while still in use

ip_local_out() and other functions can pass skb->sk as function argument.

If the skb is a fragment and reassembly happens before such function call
returns, the sk must not be released.

This affects skb fragments reassembled via netfilter or similar
modules, e.g. openvswitch or ct_act.c, when run as part of tx pipeline.

Eric Dumazet made an initial analysis of this bug.  Quoting Eric:
  Calling ip_defrag() in output path is also implying skb_orphan(),
  which is buggy because output path relies on sk not disappearing.

  A relevant old patch about the issue was :
  8282f27449bf (""inet: frag: Always orphan skbs inside ip_defrag()"")

  [..]

  net/ipv4/ip_output.c depends on skb->sk being set, and probably to an
  inet socket, not an arbitrary one.

  If we orphan the packet in ipvlan, then downstream things like FQ
  packet scheduler will not work properly.

  We need to change ip_defrag() to only use skb_orphan() when really
  needed, ie whenever frag_list is going to be used.

Eric suggested to stash sk in fragment queue and made an initial patch.
However there is a problem with this:

If skb is refragmented again right after, ip_do_fragment() will copy
head->sk to the new fragments, and sets up destructor to sock_wfree.
IOW, we have no choice but to fix up sk_wmem accouting to reflect the
fully reassembled skb, else wmem will underflow.

This change moves the orphan down into the core, to last possible moment.
As ip_defrag_offset is aliased with sk_buff->sk member, we must move the
offset into the FRAG_CB, else skb->sk gets clobbered.

This allows to delay the orphaning long enough to learn if the skb has
to be queued or if the skb is completing the reasm queue.

In the former case, things work as before, skb is orphaned.  This is
safe because skb gets queued/stolen and won't continue past reasm engine.

In the latter case, we will steal the skb->sk reference, reattach it to
the head skb, and fix up wmem accouting when inet_frag inflates truesize."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-32462	2024-04-18T18:15:09.313	2025-08-21T00:43:47.783	Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux. in versions before 1.10.9, 1.12.9, 1.14.6, and 1.15.8, a malicious or compromised Flatpak app could execute arbitrary code outside its sandbox. Normally, the `--command` argument of `flatpak run` expects to be given a command to run in the specified Flatpak app, optionally along with some arguments. However it is possible to instead pass `bwrap` arguments to `--command=`, such as `--bind`. It's possible to pass an arbitrary `commandline` to the portal interface `org.freedesktop.portal.Background.RequestBackground` from within a Flatpak app. When this is converted into a `--command` and arguments, it achieves the same effect of passing arguments directly to `bwrap`, and thus can be used for a sandbox escape. The solution is to pass the `--` argument to `bwrap`, which makes it stop processing options. This has been supported since bubblewrap 0.3.0. All supported versions of Flatpak require at least that version of bubblewrap. xdg-desktop-portal version 1.18.4 will mitigate this vulnerability by only allowing Flatpak apps to create .desktop files for commands that do not start with --. The vulnerability is patched in 1.15.8, 1.10.9, 1.12.9, and 1.14.6.	8.4	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N

By using ANSI escape sequences and a race between `libc::tcflush(0, libc::TCIFLUSH)` and reading standard input, it's possible to manipulate the permission prompt and force it to allow an unsafe action regardless of the user input. Some ANSI escape sequences act as a info request to the master terminal emulator and the terminal emulator sends back the reply in the PTY channel. standard streams also use this channel to send and get data. For example the `\033[6n` sequence requests the current cursor position. These sequences allow us to append data to the standard input of Deno.

CVE-2024-32473	2024-04-18T22:15:10.400	2025-09-04T15:09:50.443	Moby is an open source container framework that is a key component of Docker Engine, Docker Desktop, and other distributions of container tooling or runtimes. In 26.0.0, IPv6 is not disabled on network interfaces, including those belonging to networks where `--ipv6=false`. An container with an `ipvlan` or `macvlan` interface will normally be configured to share an external network link with the host machine. Because of this direct access, (1) Containers may be able to communicate with other hosts on the local network over link-local IPv6 addresses, (2) if router advertisements are being broadcast over the local network, containers may get SLAAC-assigned addresses, and (3) the interface  will be a member of IPv6 multicast groups. This means interfaces in IPv4-only networks present an unexpectedly and unnecessarily increased attack surface. The issue is patched in 26.0.2. To completely disable IPv6 in a container, use `--sysctl=net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1` in the `docker create` or `docker run` command. Or, in the service configuration of a `compose` file.	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

A NULL pointer dereference was detected during fuzzing of the analysis engine, allowing malicious clients to DoS the analysis engine. The bug occurs when `analysisd` receives a syscollector message with the `hotfix` `msg_type` but lacking a `timestamp`. It uses `cJSON_GetObjectItem()` to get the `timestamp` object item and dereferences it without checking for a `NULL` value. A malicious client can DoS the analysis engine.

CVE-2023-50260	2024-04-19T15:15:50.040	2025-01-09T17:41:36.720	Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. A wrong validation in the `host_deny` script allows to write any string in the `hosts.deny` file, which can end in an arbitrary command execution on the target system. This vulnerability is part of the active response feature, which can automatically triggers actions in response to alerts. By default, active responses are limited to a set of pre defined executables. This is enforced by only allowing executables stored under `/var/ossec/active-response/bin` to be run as an active response. However, the `/var/ossec/active-response/bin/host_deny` can be exploited. `host_deny` is used to add IP address to the `/etc/hosts.deny` file to block incoming connections on a service level by using TCP wrappers. Attacker can inject arbitrary command into the `/etc/hosts.deny` file and execute arbitrary command by using the spawn directive. The active response can be triggered by writing events either to the local `execd` queue on server or to the `ar` queue which forwards the events to agents. So, it can leads to LPE on server as root and RCE on agent as root. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.7.2.	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2024-32644	2024-04-19T15:15:50.960	2025-03-06T15:49:06.447	Evmos is a scalable, high-throughput Proof-of-Stake EVM blockchain that is fully compatible and interoperable with Ethereum. Prior to 17.0.0, there is a way to mint arbitrary tokens due to the possibility to have two different states not in sync during the execution of a transaction. The exploit is based on the fact that to sync the Cosmos SDK state and the EVM one, we rely on the `stateDB.Commit()` method. When we call this method, we iterate though all the `dirtyStorage` and, **if and only if** it is different than the `originStorage`, we set the new state. Setting the new state means we update the Cosmos SDK KVStore.  If a contract storage state that is the same before and after a transaction, but is changed during the transaction and can call an external contract after the change, it can be exploited to make the transaction similar to non-atomic. The vulnerability is **critical** since this could lead to drain of funds through creative SC interactions.

CVE-2024-31991	2024-04-19T21:15:08.133	2025-03-07T12:42:21.610	Mealie is a self hosted recipe manager and meal planner. Prior to 1.4.0, the safe_scrape_html function utilizes a user-controlled URL to issue a request to a remote server. Based on the content of the response, it will either parse the content or disregard it. This function, nor those that call it, add any restrictions on the URL that can be provided, nor is it restricted to being an FQDN (i.e., an IP address can be provided). As this function’s return will be handled differently by its caller depending on the response, it is possible for an attacker to use this functionality to positively identify HTTP(s) servers on the local network with any IP/port combination. This issue can result in any authenticated user being able to map HTTP servers on a local network that the Mealie service has access to. Note that by default any user can create an account on a Mealie server, and that the default changeme@example.com user is available with its hard-coded password. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.0.	4.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N		
CVE-2024-31992	2024-04-19T21:15:08.337	2025-03-07T12:40:49.910	Mealie is a self hosted recipe manager and meal planner. Prior to 1.4.0, the safe_scrape_html function utilizes a user-controlled URL to issue a request to a remote server, however these requests are not rate-limited. While there are efforts to prevent DDoS by implementing a timeout on requests, it is possible for an attacker to issue a large number of requests to the server which will be handled in batches based on the configuration of the Mealie server. The chunking of responses is helpful for mitigating memory exhaustion on the Mealie server, however a single request to an arbitrarily large external file (e.g. a Debian ISO) is often sufficient to completely saturate a CPU core assigned to the Mealie container. Without rate limiting in place, it is possible to not only sustain traffic against an external target indefinitely, but also to exhaust the CPU resources assigned to the Mealie container. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.0.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2024-31993	2024-04-19T21:15:08.523	2025-03-07T12:39:16.980	Mealie is a self hosted recipe manager and meal planner. Prior to 1.4.0, the scrape_image function will retrieve an image based on a user-provided URL, however the provided URL is not validated to point to an external location and does not have any enforced rate limiting. The response from the Mealie server will also vary depending on whether or not the target file is an image, is not an image, or does not exist. Additionally, when a file is retrieved the file may remain stored on Mealie’s file system as original.jpg under the UUID of the recipe it was requested for. If the attacker has access to an admin account (e.g. the default changeme@example.com), this file can then be retrieved. Note that if Mealie is running in a development setting this could be leveraged by an attacker to retrieve any file that the Mealie server had downloaded in this fashion without the need for administrator access.

CVE-2024-31994	2024-04-19T22:15:07.747	2025-03-07T12:48:22.150	Mealie is a self hosted recipe manager and meal planner. Prior to 1.4.0, an attacker can point the image request to an arbitrarily large file. Mealie will attempt to retrieve this file in whole. If it can be retrieved, it may be stored on the file system in whole (leading to possible disk consumption), however the more likely scenario given resource limitations is that the container will OOM during file retrieval if the target file size is greater than the allocated memory of the container. At best this can be used to force the container to infinitely restart due to OOM (if so configured in `docker-compose.yml), or at worst this can be used to force the Mealie container to crash and remain offline. In the event that the file can be retrieved, the lack of rate limiting on this endpoint also permits an attacker to generate ongoing requests to any target of their choice, potentially contributing to an external-facing DoS attack.

A local privilege escalation vulnerability in present in versions 2.6.0 through 2.8.2 allows any unprivileged operating system user account to escalate privileges to the root user account on the system. This vulnerability arises from Ant Media Server running with Java Management Extensions (JMX) enabled and authentication disabled on localhost on port 5599/TCP. This vulnerability is nearly identical to the local privilege escalation vulnerability CVE-2023-26269 identified in Apache James. Any unprivileged operating system user can connect to the JMX service running on port 5599/TCP on localhost and leverage the MLet Bean within JMX to load a remote MBean from an attacker-controlled server. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the Java process run by Ant Media Server and execute code within the context of the `antmedia` service account on the system. Version 2.9.0 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may remove certain parameters from the `antmedia.service` file.	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2024-32876	2024-04-24T19:15:47.140	2024-11-21T09:15:55.083	"NewPipe is an Android app for video streaming written in Java. It supports exporting and importing backups, as a way to let users move their data to a new device effortlessly. However, in versions 0.13.4 through 0.26.1, importing a backup file from an untrusted source could have resulted in Arbitrary Code Execution. This is because backups are serialized/deserialized using Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol, which can allow constructing any class in the app, unless properly restricted.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to build a backup file containing the exploit, and then persuade a user into importing it. During the import process, the malicious code would be executed, possibly crashing the app, stealing user data from the NewPipe app, performing nasty actions through Android APIs, and attempting Android JVM/Sandbox escapes through vulnerabilities in the Android OS.

The attack can take place only if the user imports a malicious backup file, so an attacker would need to trick a user into importing a backup file from a source they can control. The implementation details of the malicious backup file can be independent of the attacked user or the device they are being run on, and do not require additional privileges.

All NewPipe versions from 0.13.4 to 0.26.1 are vulnerable. NewPipe version 0.27.0 fixes the issue by doing the following: Restrict the classes that can be deserialized when calling Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol, by adding a whitelist with only innocuous data-only classes that can't lead to Arbitrary Code Execution; deprecate backups serialized with Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol; use JSON serialization for all newly created backups (but still include an alternative file serialized with Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol in the backup zip for backwards compatibility); show a warning to the user when attempting to import a backup where the only available serialization mode is Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol (note that in the future this serialization mode will be removed completely).

CVE-2024-26923	2024-04-25T06:15:57.160	2024-11-21T09:03:23.543	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_unix: Fix garbage collector racing against connect()

Garbage collector does not take into account the risk of embryo getting
enqueued during the garbage collection. If such embryo has a peer that
carries SCM_RIGHTS, two consecutive passes of scan_children() may see a
different set of children. Leading to an incorrectly elevated inflight
count, and then a dangling pointer within the gc_inflight_list.

sockets are AF_UNIX/SOCK_STREAM
S is an unconnected socket
L is a listening in-flight socket bound to addr, not in fdtable
V's fd will be passed via sendmsg(), gets inflight count bumped

connect(S, addr)	sendmsg(S, [V]); close(V)	__unix_gc()
----------------	-------------------------	-----------

NS = unix_create1()
skb1 = sock_wmalloc(NS)
L = unix_find_other(addr)
unix_state_lock(L)
unix_peer(S) = NS
			// V count=1 inflight=0

 			NS = unix_peer(S)
 			skb2 = sock_alloc()
			skb_queue_tail(NS, skb2[V])

			// V became in-flight
			// V count=2 inflight=1

			close(V)

			// V count=1 inflight=1
			// GC candidate condition met

						  if (total_refs == inflight_refs)

						// gc_candidates={L, V}

						for u in gc_candidates:

						// V count=1 inflight=2 (!)

If there is a GC-candidate listening socket, lock/unlock its state. This
makes GC wait until the end of any ongoing connect() to that socket. After
flipping the lock, a possibly SCM-laden embryo is already enqueued. And if
there is another embryo coming, it can not possibly carry SCM_RIGHTS. At
this point, unix_inflight() can not happen because unix_gc_lock is already
taken. Inflight graph remains unaffected."					
CVE-2024-26924	2024-04-25T06:15:57.407	2025-03-21T14:46:31.227	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: do not free live element

Pablo reports a crash with large batches of elements with a
back-to-back add/remove pattern.  Quoting Pablo:

  add_elem(""00000000"") timeout 100 ms
  ...
  add_elem(""0000000X"") timeout 100 ms
  del_elem(""0000000X"") <---------------- delete one that was just added
  ...
  add_elem(""00005000"") timeout 100 ms

  1) nft_pipapo_remove() removes element 0000000X
  Then, KASAN shows a splat.

Looking at the remove function there is a chance that we will drop a
rule that maps to a non-deactivated element.

Removal happens in two steps, first we do a lookup for key k and return the
to-be-removed element and mark it as inactive in the next generation.
Then, in a second step, the element gets removed from the set/map.

The _remove function does not work correctly if we have more than one
element that share the same key.

This can happen if we insert an element into a set when the set already
holds an element with same key, but the element mapping to the existing
key has timed out or is not active in the next generation.

In such case its possible that removal will unmap the wrong element.
If this happens, we will leak the non-deactivated element, it becomes
unreachable.

The element that got deactivated (and will be freed later) will
remain reachable in the set data structure, this can result in
a crash when such an element is retrieved during lookup (stale
pointer).

Add a check that the fully matching key does in fact map to the element
that we have marked as inactive in the deactivation step.
If not, we need to continue searching.

Add a bug/warn trap at the end of the function as well, the remove
function must not ever be called with an invisible/unreachable/non-existent
element.

binder: check offset alignment in binder_get_object()

Commit 6d98eb95b450 (""binder: avoid potential data leakage when copying
txn"") introduced changes to how binder objects are copied. In doing so,
it unintentionally removed an offset alignment check done through calls
to binder_alloc_copy_from_buffer() -> check_buffer().

These calls were replaced in binder_get_object() with copy_from_user(),
so now an explicit offset alignment check is needed here. This avoids
later complications when unwinding the objects gets harder.

It is worth noting this check existed prior to commit 7a67a39320df
(""binder: add function to copy binder object from buffer""), likely
removed due to redundancy at the time."

a long time.

Impact summary: Applications that use the function EVP_PKEY_public_check()
to check RSA public keys may experience long delays. Where the key that
is being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead
to a Denial of Service.

When function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is called on RSA public keys,
a computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite.
For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and this
computation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime,
then this computation would take a long time.

An application that calls EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies an RSA key
obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service
attack.

The function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is not called from other OpenSSL
functions however it is called from the OpenSSL pkey command line
application. For that reason that application is also vulnerable if used
with the '-pubin' and '-check' options on untrusted data.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue."	5.9	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Starting in version 0.3.8 and prior to version 0.4.0b1, when looping over a `range` of the form `range(start, start + N)`, if `start` is negative, the execution will always revert. This issue is caused by an incorrect assertion inserted by the code generation of the range `stmt.parse_For_range()`. The issue arises when `start` is signed, instead of using `sle`, `le` is used and `start` is interpreted as an unsigned integer for the comparison. If it is a negative number, its 255th bit is set to `1` and is hence interpreted as a very large unsigned integer making the assertion always fail. Any contract having a `range(start, start + N)` where `start` is a signed integer with the possibility for `start` to be negative is affected. If a call goes through the loop while supplying a negative `start` the execution will revert. Version 0.4.0b1 fixes the issue.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

In versions 0.3.10 and prior, using the `slice` builtin can result in a double eval vulnerability when the buffer argument is either `msg.data`, `self.code` or `<address>.code` and either the `start` or `length` arguments have side-effects. It can be easily triggered only with the versions `<0.3.4` as `0.3.4` introduced the unique symbol fence. No vulnerable production contracts were found. Additionally, double evaluation of side-effects should be easily discoverable in client tests. As such, the impact is low. As of time of publication, no fixed versions are available.

CVE-2024-32883	2024-04-26T21:15:49.630	2024-11-21T09:15:56.057	MCUboot is a secure bootloader for 32-bits microcontrollers. MCUboot uses a TLV (tag-length-value) structure to represent the meta data associated with an image.  The TLVs themselves are divided into two sections, a protected and an unprotected section. The protected TLV entries are included as part of the image signature to avoid tampering. However, the code does not distinguish which TLV entries should be protected or not, so it is possible for an attacker to add unprotected TLV entries that should be protected. Currently, the primary protected TLV entries should be the dependency indication, and the boot record. An injected dependency value would primarily result in an otherwise acceptable image being rejected. A boot record injection could allow fields in a later attestation record to include data not intended, which could cause an image to appear to have properties that it should not have. As a workaround, disable the boot record functionality. 	7.7	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H

drm/gma500: Fix BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context errors

gma_crtc_page_flip() was holding the event_lock spinlock while calling
crtc_funcs->mode_set_base() which takes ww_mutex.

The only reason to hold event_lock is to clear gma_crtc->page_flip_event
on mode_set_base() errors.

Instead unlock it after setting gma_crtc->page_flip_event and on
errors re-take the lock and clear gma_crtc->page_flip_event it
it is still set.

net/sched: taprio: avoid disabling offload when it was never enabled

In an incredibly strange API design decision, qdisc->destroy() gets
called even if qdisc->init() never succeeded, not exclusively since
commit 87b60cfacf9f (""net_sched: fix error recovery at qdisc creation""),
but apparently also earlier (in the case of qdisc_create_dflt()).

The taprio qdisc does not fully acknowledge this when it attempts full
offload, because it starts off with q->flags = TAPRIO_FLAGS_INVALID in
taprio_init(), then it replaces q->flags with TCA_TAPRIO_ATTR_FLAGS
parsed from netlink (in taprio_change(), tail called from taprio_init()).

But in taprio_destroy(), we call taprio_disable_offload(), and this
determines what to do based on FULL_OFFLOAD_IS_ENABLED(q->flags).

But looking at the implementation of FULL_OFFLOAD_IS_ENABLED()
(a bitwise check of bit 1 in q->flags), it is invalid to call this macro
on q->flags when it contains TAPRIO_FLAGS_INVALID, because that is set
to U32_MAX, and therefore FULL_OFFLOAD_IS_ENABLED() will return true on
an invalid set of flags.

As a result, it is possible to crash the kernel if user space forces an
error between setting q->flags = TAPRIO_FLAGS_INVALID, and the calling
of taprio_enable_offload(). This is because drivers do not expect the
offload to be disabled when it was never enabled.

The error that we force here is to attach taprio as a non-root qdisc,
but instead as child of an mqprio root qdisc:

sfc: fix TX channel offset when using legacy interrupts

In legacy interrupt mode the tx_channel_offset was hardcoded to 1, but
that's not correct if efx_sepparate_tx_channels is false. In that case,
the offset is 0 because the tx queues are in the single existing channel
at index 0, together with the rx queue.

get the tx queues from an uninitialized channel getting these errors:

because we can only be here if tx_queue is NULL, so we shouldn't
dereference it. As the above comment in the code says, this is very
unlikely to happen, but it's wrong anyway so let's fix it.

I hit this issue because of a different bug that caused tx_queue to be

ipvlan: Fix out-of-bound bugs caused by unset skb->mac_header

If an AF_PACKET socket is used to send packets through ipvlan and the

dev_queue_xmit() to packet_direct_xmit() via setsockopt() with the option
name of PACKET_QDISC_BYPASS, the skb->mac_header may not be reset and
remains as the initial value of 65535, this may trigger slab-out-of-bounds

The root cause is:
  1. packet_snd() only reset skb->mac_header when sock->type is SOCK_RAW
     and skb->protocol is not specified as in packet_parse_headers()

  2. packet_direct_xmit() doesn't reset skb->mac_header as dev_queue_xmit()

In this case, skb->mac_header is 65535 when ipvlan_xmit_mode_l2() is
called. So when ipvlan_xmit_mode_l2() gets mac header with eth_hdr() which
use ""skb->head + skb->mac_header"", out-of-bound access occurs.

This patch replaces eth_hdr() with skb_eth_hdr() in ipvlan_xmit_mode_l2()
and reset mac header in multicast to solve this out-of-bound bug."	7.7	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H

i915_perf assumes that it can use the i915_gem_context reference to

What happens is the following:

1) The cleaner kthread tries to start a transaction to delete an unused
   block group, but the metadata reservation can not be satisfied right
   away, so a reservation ticket is created and it starts the async
   metadata reclaim task (fs_info->async_reclaim_work);

2) Writeback for all the filler inodes with an i_size of 2K starts
   (generic/562 creates a lot of 2K files with the goal of filling
   metadata space). We try to create an inline extent for them, but we
   fail when trying to insert the inline extent with -ENOSPC (at
   cow_file_range_inline()) - since this is not critical, we fallback
   to non-inline mode (back to cow_file_range()), reserve extents

CVE-2024-32970	2024-04-30T23:15:06.483	2024-11-21T09:16:08.173	Phlex is a framework for building object-oriented views in Ruby. In affected versions there is a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited via maliciously crafted user data. Since the last two vulnerabilities https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/security/advisories/GHSA-242p-4v39-2v8g and https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/security/advisories/GHSA-g7xq-xv8c-h98c, we have invested in extensive browser tests. It was these new tests that helped us uncover these issues. As of now the project exercises every possible attack vector the developers can think of — including enumerating every ASCII character, and we run these tests in Chrome, Firefox and Safari. Additionally, we test against a list of 6613 known XSS payloads (see: payloadbox/xss-payload-list). The reason these issues were not detected before is the escapes were working as designed. However, their design didn't take into account just how recklessly permissive browsers are when it comes to executing unsafe JavaScript via HTML attributes. If you render an `<a>` tag with an `href` attribute set to a user-provided link, that link could potentially execute JavaScript when clicked by another user. If you splat user-provided attributes when rendering any HTML or SVG tag, malicious event attributes could be included in the output, executing JavaScript when the events are triggered by another user. Patches are available on RubyGems for all minor versions released in the last year. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should configure a Content Security Policy that does not allow `unsafe-inline` which would effectively prevent this vulnerability from being exploited. Users who upgrade are also advised to configure a Content Security Policy header that does not allow `unsafe-inline`.	7.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
