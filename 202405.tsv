CVE-2024-4369	2024-05-01T00:15:06.890	2024-11-21T09:42:42.850	An information disclosure flaw was found in OpenShift's internal image registry operator. The AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET can be exposed through an environment variable defined in the pod definition, but is limited to Azure environments. An attacker controlling an account that has high enough permissions to obtain pod information from the openshift-image-registry namespace could use this obtained client secret to perform actions as the registry operator's Azure service account.	6.8	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

media: nxp: imx8-isi: Check whether crossbar pad is non-NULL before access

When translating source to sink streams in the crossbar subdev, the
driver tries to locate the remote subdev connected to the sink pad. The
remote pad may be NULL, if userspace tries to enable a stream that ends
at an unconnected crossbar sink. When that occurs, the driver
dereferences the NULL pad, leading to a crash.

Prevent the crash by checking if the pad is NULL before using it, and
return an error if it is."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

drm/vmwgfx: Unmap the surface before resetting it on a plane state

Switch to a new plane state requires unreferencing of all held surfaces.
In the work required for mob cursors the mapped surfaces started being
cached but the variable indicating whether the surface is currently
mapped was not being reset. This leads to crashes as the duplicated
state, incorrectly, indicates the that surface is mapped even when
no surface is present. That's because after unreferencing the surface
it's perfectly possible for the plane to be backed by a bo instead of a
surface.

Reset the surface mapped flag when unreferencing the plane state surface
to fix null derefs in cleanup. Fixes crashes in KDE KWin 6.0 on Wayland:

USB: core: Fix deadlock in port ""disable"" sysfs attribute

The show and store callback routines for the ""disable"" sysfs attribute
file in port.c acquire the device lock for the port's parent hub
device.  This can cause problems if another process has locked the hub
to remove it or change its configuration:

	Removing the hub or changing its configuration requires the
	hub interface to be removed, which requires the port device
	to be removed, and device_del() waits until all outstanding
	sysfs attribute callbacks for the ports have returned.  The
	lock can't be released until then.

	But the disable_show() or disable_store() routine can't return
	until after it has acquired the lock.

The resulting deadlock can be avoided by calling
sysfs_break_active_protection().  This will cause the sysfs core not
to wait for the attribute's callback routine to return, allowing the
removal to proceed.  The disadvantage is that after making this call,
there is no guarantee that the hub structure won't be deallocated at
any moment.  To prevent this, we have to acquire a reference to it
first by calling hub_get()."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

and tries to remove the interface, whether through a configuration
change or because the device has been disconnected.  As part of the
removal procedure, device_del() waits for all ongoing sysfs attribute
callbacks to complete.  But usb_deauthorize_interface() can't complete
until the device lock has been released, and the lock won't be
released until the removal has finished.

The mechanism provided by sysfs to prevent this kind of deadlock is
to use the sysfs_break_active_protection() function, which tells sysfs
not to wait for the attribute callback.

CVE-2024-26935	2024-05-01T06:15:08.240	2024-11-21T09:03:25.507	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: core: Fix unremoved procfs host directory regression

Commit fc663711b944 (""scsi: core: Remove the /proc/scsi/${proc_name}
directory earlier"") fixed a bug related to modules loading/unloading, by
adding a call to scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on scsi_remove_host(). But that led
to a potential duplicate call to the hostdir_rm() routine, since it's also
called from scsi_host_dev_release(). That triggered a regression report,
which was then fixed by commit be03df3d4bfe (""scsi: core: Fix a procfs host
directory removal regression""). The fix just dropped the hostdir_rm() call
from dev_release().

But it happens that this proc directory is created on scsi_host_alloc(),
and that function ""pairs"" with scsi_host_dev_release(), while
scsi_remove_host() pairs with scsi_add_host(). In other words, it seems the
reason for removing the proc directory on dev_release() was meant to cover
cases in which a SCSI host structure was allocated, but the call to
scsi_add_host() didn't happen. And that pattern happens to exist in some
error paths, for example.

Syzkaller causes that by using USB raw gadget device, error'ing on
usb-storage driver, at usb_stor_probe2(). By checking that path, we can see
that the BadDevice label leads to a scsi_host_put() after a SCSI host
allocation, but there's no call to scsi_add_host() in such path. That leads
to messages like this in dmesg (and a leak of the SCSI host proc
structure):

usb-storage 4-1:87.51: USB Mass Storage device detected
proc_dir_entry 'scsi/usb-storage' already registered
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 3519 at fs/proc/generic.c:377 proc_register+0x347/0x4e0 fs/proc/generic.c:376

The proper fix seems to still call scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() on dev_release(),
but guard that with the state check for SHOST_CREATED; there is even a
comment in scsi_host_dev_release() detailing that: such conditional is
meant for cases where the SCSI host was allocated but there was no calls to
{add,remove}_host(), like the usb-storage case.

This is what we propose here and with that, the error path of usb-storage
does not trigger the warning anymore."

drm/i915/gt: Reset queue_priority_hint on parking

Originally, with strict in order execution, we could complete execution
only when the queue was empty. Preempt-to-busy allows replacement of an
active request that may complete before the preemption is processed by
HW. If that happens, the request is retired from the queue, but the
queue_priority_hint remains set, preventing direct submission until
after the next CS interrupt is processed.

This preempt-to-busy race can be triggered by the heartbeat, which will
also act as the power-management barrier and upon completion allow us to
idle the HW. We may process the completion of the heartbeat, and begin
parking the engine before the CS event that restores the
queue_priority_hint, causing us to fail the assertion that it is MIN.

That has been tracked down to be happening when another thread is
deactivating the VMA inside __active_retire() helper, after the VMA's
active counter has been already decremented to 0, but before deactivation
of the VMA's object is reported to the object debugging tool.

We could prevent from that race by serializing i915_active_fini() with
__active_retire() via ref->tree_lock, but that wouldn't stop the VMA from
being used, e.g. from __i915_vma_retire() called at the end of
__active_retire(), after that VMA has been already freed by a concurrent
i915_vma_destroy() on return from the i915_active_fini().  Then, we should
rather fix the issue at the VMA level, not in i915_active.

Since __i915_vma_parked() is called from __gt_park() on last put of the
GT's wakeref, the issue could be addressed by holding the GT wakeref long
enough for __active_retire() to complete before that wakeref is released
and the GT parked.

I believe the issue was introduced by commit d93939730347 (""drm/i915:
Remove the vma refcount"") which moved a call to i915_active_fini() from
a dropped i915_vma_release(), called on last put of the removed VMA kref,
to i915_vma_parked() processing path called on last put of a GT wakeref.
However, its visibility to the object debugging tool was suppressed by a
bug in i915_active that was fixed two weeks later with commit e92eb246feb9
(""drm/i915/active: Fix missing debug object activation"").

A VMA associated with a request doesn't acquire a GT wakeref by itself.
Instead, it depends on a wakeref held directly by the request's active
intel_context for a GT associated with its VM, and indirectly on that
intel_context's engine wakeref if the engine belongs to the same GT as the
VMA's VM.  Those wakerefs are released asynchronously to VMA deactivation.

Fix the issue by getting a wakeref for the VMA's GT when activating it,
and putting that wakeref only after the VMA is deactivated.  However,
exclude global GTT from that processing path, otherwise the GPU never goes
idle.  Since __i915_vma_retire() may be called from atomic contexts, use
async variant of wakeref put.  Also, to avoid circular locking dependency,
take care of acquiring the wakeref before VM mutex when both are needed.

v7: Add inline comments with justifications for:
    - using untracked variants of intel_gt_pm_get/put() (Nirmoy),
    - using async variant of _put(),
    - not getting the wakeref in case of a global GTT,
    - always getting the first wakeref outside vm->mutex.
v6: Since __i915_vma_active/retire() callbacks are not serialized, storing
    a wakeref tracking handle inside struct i915_vma is not safe, and
    there is no other good place for that.  Use untracked variants of
    intel_gt_pm_get/put_async().
v5: Replace ""tile"" with ""GT"" across commit description (Rodrigo),

wireguard: netlink: check for dangling peer via is_dead instead of empty list

If all peers are removed via wg_peer_remove_all(), rather than setting
peer_list to empty, the peer is added to a temporary list with a head on
the stack of wg_peer_remove_all(). If a netlink dump is resumed and the
cursored peer is one that has been removed via wg_peer_remove_all(), it
will iterate from that peer and then attempt to dump freed peers.

Fix this by instead checking peer->is_dead, which was explictly created
for this purpose. Also move up the device_update_lock lockdep assertion,
since reading is_dead relies on that.

It can be reproduced by a small script like:

    echo ""Setting config...""
    ip link add dev wg0 type wireguard
    wg setconf wg0 /big-config
    (
            while true; do

nilfs2: fix failure to detect DAT corruption in btree and direct mappings

Patch series ""nilfs2: fix kernel bug at submit_bh_wbc()"".

This resolves a kernel BUG reported by syzbot.  Since there are two
flaws involved, I've made each one a separate patch.

The first patch alone resolves the syzbot-reported bug, but I think
both fixes should be sent to stable, so I've tagged them as such.


This patch (of 2):

Syzbot has reported a kernel bug in submit_bh_wbc() when writing file data
to a nilfs2 file system whose metadata is corrupted.

There are two flaws involved in this issue.

The first flaw is that when nilfs_get_block() locates a data block using
btree or direct mapping, if the disk address translation routine
nilfs_dat_translate() fails with internal code -ENOENT due to DAT metadata
corruption, it can be passed back to nilfs_get_block().  This causes
nilfs_get_block() to misidentify an existing block as non-existent,
causing both data block lookup and insertion to fail inconsistently.

The second flaw is that nilfs_get_block() returns a successful status in
this inconsistent state.  This causes the caller __block_write_begin_int()
or others to request a read even though the buffer is not mapped,
resulting in a BUG_ON check for the BH_Mapped flag in submit_bh_wbc()
failing.

This fixes the first issue by changing the return value to code -EINVAL
when a conversion using DAT fails with code -ENOENT, avoiding the
conflicting condition that leads to the kernel bug described above.  Here,
code -EINVAL indicates that metadata corruption was detected during the
block lookup, which will be properly handled as a file system error and
converted to -EIO when passing through the nilfs2 bmap layer."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

This is because we're completing the nfs_direct_request twice in a row.

The source of this is when we have our commit requests to submit, we
process them and send them off, and then in the completion path for the
commit requests we have

if (nfs_commit_end(cinfo.mds))
	nfs_direct_write_complete(dreq);

However since we're submitting asynchronous requests we sometimes have
one that completes before we submit the next one, so we end up calling
complete on the nfs_direct_request twice.

The only other place we use nfs_generic_commit_list() is in
__nfs_commit_inode, which wraps this call in a

nfs_commit_begin();
nfs_commit_end();

Which is a common pattern for this style of completion handling, one
that is also repeated in the direct code with get_dreq()/put_dreq()
calls around where we process events as well as in the completion paths.

Fix this by using the same pattern for the commit requests.

mm: swap: fix race between free_swap_and_cache() and swapoff()

There was previously a theoretical window where swapoff() could run and
teardown a swap_info_struct while a call to free_swap_and_cache() was
running in another thread.  This could cause, amongst other bad
possibilities, swap_page_trans_huge_swapped() (called by
free_swap_and_cache()) to access the freed memory for swap_map.

This is a theoretical problem and I haven't been able to provoke it from a
test case.  But there has been agreement based on code review that this is
possible (see link below).

Fix it by using get_swap_device()/put_swap_device(), which will stall
swapoff().  There was an extra check in _swap_info_get() to confirm that
the swap entry was not free.  This isn't present in get_swap_device()
because it doesn't make sense in general due to the race between getting
the reference and swapoff.  So I've added an equivalent check directly in
free_swap_and_cache().

Details of how to provoke one possible issue (thanks to David Hildenbrand
for deriving this):

--8<-----

__swap_entry_free() might be the last user and result in
""count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE"".

swapoff->try_to_unuse() will stop as soon as soon as si->inuse_pages==0.

So the question is: could someone reclaim the folio and turn
si->inuse_pages==0, before we completed swap_page_trans_huge_swapped().

Imagine the following: 2 MiB folio in the swapcache. Only 2 subpages are
still references by swap entries.

Process 1 still references subpage 0 via swap entry.
Process 2 still references subpage 1 via swap entry.

Process 1 quits. Calls free_swap_and_cache().
-> count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE
[then, preempted in the hypervisor etc.]

Process 2 quits. Calls free_swap_and_cache().
-> count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE

Process 2 goes ahead, passes swap_page_trans_huge_swapped(), and calls
__try_to_reclaim_swap().

__try_to_reclaim_swap()->folio_free_swap()->delete_from_swap_cache()->
put_swap_folio()->free_swap_slot()->swapcache_free_entries()->
swap_entry_free()->swap_range_free()->
...
WRITE_ONCE(si->inuse_pages, si->inuse_pages - nr_entries);

What stops swapoff to succeed after process 2 reclaimed the swap cache
but before process1 finished its call to swap_page_trans_huge_swapped()?

Note that if llsec_lookup_key() finds a key, it gets a refcount via
llsec_key_get() and locally copies key id from key_entry (which is a
list element). So it's safe to call llsec_key_put() and free the list

After commit c467e97f079f (""md/raid6: use valid sector values to determine
if an I/O should wait on the reshape"") fix the problem that IO across
reshape position doesn't wait for reshape, the dm-raid test
shell/lvconvert-raid-reshape.sh start to hang:

This is because reshape can't make progress.

For md/raid, the problem doesn't exist because register new sync_thread
doesn't rely on the IO to be done any more:

1) If array is read-only, it can switch to read-write by ioctl/sysfs;
2) md/raid never set MD_RECOVERY_WAIT;
3) If MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN is set, mddev_suspend() doesn't hold
   'reconfig_mutex', hence it can be cleared and reshape can continue by
   sysfs api 'sync_action'.

However, I'm not sure yet how to avoid the problem in dm-raid yet. This
patch on the one hand make sure raid_message() can't change
sync_thread() through raid_message() after presuspend(), on the other
hand detect the above 3 cases before wait for IO do be done in
dm_suspend(), and let dm-raid requeue those IO."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

KVM must ensure that none of its workqueue callbacks is running when the

If kvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue() actually flushes the workqueue,
then there's no need to gift async_pf_execute() a reference because all
invocations of async_pf_execute() will be forced to complete before the
vCPU and its VM are destroyed/freed.  And that in turn fixes the module
unloading bug as __fput() won't do module_put() on the last vCPU reference
until the vCPU has been freed, e.g. if closing the vCPU file also puts the
last reference to the KVM module.

Note that kvm_check_async_pf_completion() may also take the work item off
the completion queue and so also needs to flush the work queue, as the
work will not be seen by kvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue().  Waiting
on the workqueue could theoretically delay a vCPU due to waiting for the
work to complete, but that's a very, very small chance, and likely a very
small delay.  kvm_arch_async_page_present_queued() unconditionally makes a
new request, i.e. will effectively delay entering the guest, so the
remaining work is really just:

        trace_kvm_async_pf_completed(addr, cr2_or_gpa);

        __kvm_vcpu_wake_up(vcpu);

        mmput(mm);

and mmput() can't drop the last reference to the page tables if the vCPU is
still alive, i.e. the vCPU won't get stuck tearing down page tables.

Add a helper to do the flushing, specifically to deal with ""wakeup all""
work items, as they aren't actually work items, i.e. are never placed in a
workqueue.  Trying to flush a bogus workqueue entry rightly makes
__flush_work() complain (kudos to whoever added that sanity check).

Squashfs: check the inode number is not the invalid value of zero

Syskiller has produced an out of bounds access in fill_meta_index().

That out of bounds access is ultimately caused because the inode
has an inode number with the invalid value of zero, which was not checked.

The reason this causes the out of bounds access is due to following
sequence of events:

1. Fill_meta_index() is called to allocate (via empty_meta_index())
   and fill a metadata index.  It however suffers a data read error
   and aborts, invalidating the newly returned empty metadata index.
   It does this by setting the inode number of the index to zero,
   which means unused (zero is not a valid inode number).

2. When fill_meta_index() is subsequently called again on another
   read operation, locate_meta_index() returns the previous index
   because it matches the inode number of 0.  Because this index
   has been returned it is expected to have been filled, and because
   it hasn't been, an out of bounds access is performed.

This patch adds a sanity check which checks that the inode number
is not zero when the inode is created and returns -EINVAL if it is.

Adding any sort of useful debug usually makes it go away, so I hand
wrote the function in a line, and debugged the asm.

Every so often pt->memory->ptrs is NULL. This ptrs ptr is set in
the nv50_instobj_acquire called from nvkm_kmap.

If Thread A and Thread B both get to nv50_instobj_acquire around
the same time, and Thread A hits the refcount_set line, and in
lockstep thread B succeeds at refcount_inc_not_zero, there is a
chance the ptrs value won't have been stored since refcount_set
is unordered. Force a memory barrier here, I picked smp_mb, since
we want it on all CPUs and it's write followed by a read.

debug_pagealloc_enabled() and arm64_kfence_can_set_direct_map() false),

should not be saved during hibernation.

This problem was introduced by changes to the pfn_valid() logic in

KVM: x86/mmu: Write-protect L2 SPTEs in TDP MMU when clearing dirty status

Check kvm_mmu_page_ad_need_write_protect() when deciding whether to
write-protect or clear D-bits on TDP MMU SPTEs, so that the TDP MMU
accounts for any role-specific reasons for disabling D-bit dirty logging.

Specifically, TDP MMU SPTEs must be write-protected when the TDP MMU is
being used to run an L2 (i.e. L1 has disabled EPT) and PML is enabled.
KVM always disables PML when running L2, even when L1 and L2 GPAs are in
the some domain, so failing to write-protect TDP MMU SPTEs will cause
writes made by L2 to not be reflected in the dirty log.

KVM: x86/mmu: x86: Don't overflow lpage_info when checking attributes

Fix KVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES to not overflow lpage_info array and trigger
KASAN splat, as seen in the private_mem_conversions_test selftest.

When memory attributes are set on a GFN range, that range will have
specific properties applied to the TDP. A huge page cannot be used when
the attributes are inconsistent, so they are disabled for those the
specific huge pages. For internal KVM reasons, huge pages are also not
allowed to span adjacent memslots regardless of whether the backing memory
could be mapped as huge.

What GFNs support which huge page sizes is tracked by an array of arrays
'lpage_info' on the memslot, of ‘kvm_lpage_info’ structs. Each index of
lpage_info contains a vmalloc allocated array of these for a specific
supported page size. The kvm_lpage_info denotes whether a specific huge
page (GFN and page size) on the memslot is supported. These arrays include
indices for unaligned head and tail huge pages.

Preventing huge pages from spanning adjacent memslot is covered by
incrementing the count in head and tail kvm_lpage_info when the memslot is
allocated, but disallowing huge pages for memory that has mixed attributes
has to be done in a more complicated way. During the
KVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES ioctl KVM updates lpage_info for each memslot in
the range that has mismatched attributes. KVM does this a memslot at a
time, and marks a special bit, KVM_LPAGE_MIXED_FLAG, in the kvm_lpage_info
for any huge page. This bit is essentially a permanently elevated count.
So huge pages will not be mapped for the GFN at that page size if the
count is elevated in either case: a huge head or tail page unaligned to
the memslot or if KVM_LPAGE_MIXED_FLAG is set because it has mixed
attributes.

To determine whether a huge page has consistent attributes, the
KVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES operation checks an xarray to make sure it
consistently has the incoming attribute. Since level - 1 huge pages are
aligned to level huge pages, it employs an optimization. As long as the
level - 1 huge pages are checked first, it can just check these and assume
that if each level - 1 huge page contained within the level sized huge
page is not mixed, then the level size huge page is not mixed. This
optimization happens in the helper hugepage_has_attrs().

Unfortunately, although the kvm_lpage_info array representing page size
'level' will contain an entry for an unaligned tail page of size level,
the array for level - 1  will not contain an entry for each GFN at page
size level. The level - 1 array will only contain an index for any
unaligned region covered by level - 1 huge page size, which can be a
smaller region. So this causes the optimization to overflow the level - 1
kvm_lpage_info and perform a vmalloc out of bounds read.

In some cases of head and tail pages where an overflow could happen,
callers skip the operation completely as KVM_LPAGE_MIXED_FLAG is not
required to prevent huge pages as discussed earlier. But for memslots that
are smaller than the 1GB page size, it does call hugepage_has_attrs(). In
this case the huge page is both the head and tail page. The issue can be
observed simply by compiling the kernel with CONFIG_KASAN_VMALLOC and
running the selftest “private_mem_conversions_test”, which produces the
output like the following:

BUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in hugepage_has_attrs+0x7e/0x110

It is a little ambiguous whether the unaligned head page (in the bug case
also the tail page) should be expected to have KVM_LPAGE_MIXED_FLAG set.

CVE-2024-26992	2024-05-01T06:15:16.957	2025-09-18T14:31:07.960	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86/pmu: Disable support for adaptive PEBS

Drop support for virtualizing adaptive PEBS, as KVM's implementation is
architecturally broken without an obvious/easy path forward, and because
exposing adaptive PEBS can leak host LBRs to the guest, i.e. can leak
host kernel addresses to the guest.

Bug #1 is that KVM doesn't account for the upper 32 bits of
IA32_FIXED_CTR_CTRL when (re)programming fixed counters, e.g
fixed_ctrl_field() drops the upper bits, reprogram_fixed_counters()
stores local variables as u8s and truncates the upper bits too, etc.

Bug #2 is that, because KVM _always_ sets precise_ip to a non-zero value
for PEBS events, perf will _always_ generate an adaptive record, even if
the guest requested a basic record.  Note, KVM will also enable adaptive
PEBS in individual *counter*, even if adaptive PEBS isn't exposed to the
guest, but this is benign as MSR_PEBS_DATA_CFG is guaranteed to be zero,
i.e. the guest will only ever see Basic records.

Bug #3 is in perf.  intel_pmu_disable_fixed() doesn't clear the upper
bits either, i.e. leaves ICL_FIXED_0_ADAPTIVE set, and
intel_pmu_enable_fixed() effectively doesn't clear ICL_FIXED_0_ADAPTIVE
either.  I.e. perf _always_ enables ADAPTIVE counters, regardless of what
KVM requests.

Bug #4 is that adaptive PEBS *might* effectively bypass event filters set
by the host, as ""Updated Memory Access Info Group"" records information
that might be disallowed by userspace via KVM_SET_PMU_EVENT_FILTER.

Bug #5 is that KVM doesn't ensure LBR MSRs hold guest values (or at least
zeros) when entering a vCPU with adaptive PEBS, which allows the guest
to read host LBRs, i.e. host RIPs/addresses, by enabling ""LBR Entries""
records.

Disable adaptive PEBS support as an immediate fix due to the severity of
the LBR leak in particular, and because fixing all of the bugs will be
non-trivial, e.g. not suitable for backporting to stable kernels.

Note!  This will break live migration, but trying to make KVM play nice
with live migration would be quite complicated, wouldn't be guaranteed to
work (i.e. KVM might still kill/confuse the guest), and it's not clear
that there are any publicly available VMMs that support adaptive PEBS,
let alone live migrate VMs that support adaptive PEBS, e.g. QEMU doesn't
support PEBS in any capacity."	3.3	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

When ncm function is working and then stop usb0 interface for link down,

should happen in usb_ep_enable(), 'in_ep' and/or 'out_ep' may not be enabled.

After that, ncm_disable() is called to disable for ncm unbind

As the result, ncm object is released in ncm unbind

And when ncm bind again to recover netdev, ncm object is reallocated
but usb0 interface is already associated to previous released ncm object.

The first thread is walking the clk tree and calling
clk_pm_runtime_get() to power on devices required to read the clk
hardware via struct clk_ops::is_enabled(). This thread holds the clk
prepare_lock, and is trying to runtime PM resume a device, when it finds
that the device is in the process of resuming so the thread schedule()s
away waiting for the device to finish resuming before continuing. The
second thread is runtime PM resuming the same device, but the runtime
resume callback is calling clk_prepare(), trying to grab the
prepare_lock waiting on the first thread.

This is a classic ABBA deadlock. To properly fix the deadlock, we must
never runtime PM resume or suspend a device with the clk prepare_lock
held. Actually doing that is near impossible today because the global
prepare_lock would have to be dropped in the middle of the tree, the
device runtime PM resumed/suspended, and then the prepare_lock grabbed
again to ensure consistency of the clk tree topology. If anything
changes with the clk tree in the meantime, we've lost and will need to
start the operation all over again.

Luckily, most of the time we're simply incrementing or decrementing the
runtime PM count on an active device, so we don't have the chance to
schedule away with the prepare_lock held. Let's fix this immediate
problem that can be

CVE-2024-27005	2024-05-01T06:15:18.883	2025-04-08T18:43:15.860	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

interconnect: Don't access req_list while it's being manipulated

The icc_lock mutex was split into separate icc_lock and icc_bw_lock
mutexes in [1] to avoid lockdep splats. However, this didn't adequately
protect access to icc_node::req_list.

The icc_set_bw() function will eventually iterate over req_list while
only holding icc_bw_lock, but req_list can be modified while only
holding icc_lock. This causes races between icc_set_bw(), of_icc_get(),
and icc_put().

Example A:

  CPU0                               CPU1
  ----                               ----
  icc_set_bw(path_a)
    mutex_lock(&icc_bw_lock);
                                     icc_put(path_b)
                                       mutex_lock(&icc_lock);
    aggregate_requests()
      hlist_for_each_entry(r, ...
                                       hlist_del(...
        <r = invalid pointer>

Example B:

  CPU0                               CPU1
  ----                               ----
  icc_set_bw(path_a)
    mutex_lock(&icc_bw_lock);
                                     path_b = of_icc_get()
                                       of_icc_get_by_index()
                                         mutex_lock(&icc_lock);
                                         path_find()
                                           path_init()
    aggregate_requests()
      hlist_for_each_entry(r, ...

        <r = invalid pointer>

Fix this by ensuring icc_bw_lock is always held before manipulating
icc_node::req_list. The additional places icc_bw_lock is held don't
perform any memory allocations, so we should still be safe from the
original lockdep splats that motivated the separate locks.

thermal/debugfs: Add missing count increment to thermal_debug_tz_trip_up()

The count field in struct trip_stats, representing the number of times
the zone temperature was above the trip point, needs to be incremented
in thermal_debug_tz_trip_up(), for two reasons.

First, if a trip point is crossed on the way up for the first time,
thermal_debug_update_temp() called from update_temperature() does
not see it because it has not been added to trips_crossed[] array
in the thermal zone's struct tz_debugfs object yet.  Therefore, when
thermal_debug_tz_trip_up() is called after that, the trip point's
count value is 0, and the attempt to divide by it during the average
temperature computation leads to a divide error which causes the kernel
to crash.  Setting the count to 1 before the division by incrementing it
fixes this problem.

Second, if a trip point is crossed on the way up, but it has been
crossed on the way up already before, its count value needs to be
incremented to make a record of the fact that the zone temperature is
above the trip now.  Without doing that, if the mitigations applied
after crossing the trip cause the zone temperature to drop below its
threshold, the count will not be updated for this episode at all and
the average temperature in the trip statistics record will be somewhat
higher than it should be.

netfilter: nf_tables: fix memleak in map from abort path

The delete set command does not rely on the transaction object for
element removal, therefore, a combination of delete element + delete set

Check for inactive element in the next generation for the delete element
command in the abort path, skip restoring state if next generation bit
has been already cleared. This is similar to the activate logic using
the set walk iterator.

netfilter: nf_tables: restore set elements when delete set fails

From abort path, nft_mapelem_activate() needs to restore refcounters to
the original state. Currently, it uses the set->ops->walk() to iterate
over these set elements. The existing set iterator skips inactive
elements in the next generation, this does not work from the abort path
to restore the original state since it has to skip active elements
instead (not inactive ones).

This patch moves the check for inactive elements to the set iterator
callback, then it reverses the logic for the .activate case which
needs to skip active elements.

Toggle next generation bit for elements when delete set command is
invoked and call nft_clear() from .activate (abort) path to restore the
next generation bit.

CVE-2024-27014	2024-05-01T06:15:20.063	2024-11-21T09:03:39.663	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Prevent deadlock while disabling aRFS

When disabling aRFS under the `priv->state_lock`, any scheduled
aRFS works are canceled using the `cancel_work_sync` function,
which waits for the work to end if it has already started.
However, while waiting for the work handler, the handler will
try to acquire the `state_lock` which is already acquired.

The worker acquires the lock to delete the rules if the state
is down, which is not the worker's responsibility since
disabling aRFS deletes the rules.

Add an aRFS state variable, which indicates whether the aRFS is
enabled and prevent adding rules when the aRFS is disabled.

For historical reasons, when bridge device is in promisc mode, packets

adds a workaround to reset conntrack for these packets.

Jianbo Liu reports warning splats in their test infrastructure where
cloned packets reach the br_netfilter input hook to confirm the

Scratch one bit from BR_INPUT_SKB_CB to annotate that this packet has
reached the input hook because it is passed up to the bridge device to

In affected versions if directory listings are enabled for a directory that an untrusted user has upload privileges for, a malicious file name like `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>.txt` will allow JavaScript code execution in the context of the web server’s domain. SWS generally does not perform escaping of HTML entities on any values inserted in the directory listing. At the very least `file_name` and `current_path` could contain malicious data however. `file_uri` could also be malicious but the relevant scenarios seem to be all caught by hyper.

The Rust implementation of the Yamux stream multiplexer uses a vector for pending frames. This vector is not bounded in length. Every time the Yamux protocol requires sending of a new frame, this frame gets appended to this vector. This can be remotely triggered in a number of ways, for example by: 1. Opening a new libp2p Identify stream. This causes the node to send its Identify message. Of course, every other protocol that causes the sending of data also works. The larger the response, the more data is enqueued. 2. Sending a Yamux Ping frame. This causes a Pong frame to be enqueued. Under normal circumstances, this queue of pending frames would be drained once they’re sent out over the network. However, the attacker can use TCP’s receive window mechanism to prevent the victim from sending out any data: By not reading from the TCP connection, the receive window will never be increased, and the victim won’t be able to send out any new data (this is how TCP implements backpressure). Once this happens, Yamux’s queue of pending frames will start growing indefinitely. The queue will only be drained once the underlying TCP connection is closed. An attacker can cause a remote node to run out of memory, which will result in the corresponding process getting terminated by the operating system.

another page in the mapping could be processed for writeback inside

while reducing code complexity.

cifs: Fix writeback data corruption

cifs writeback doesn't correctly handle the case where
cifs_extend_writeback() hits a point where it is considering an additional
folio, but this would overrun the wsize - at which point it drops out of
the xarray scanning loop and calls xas_pause().  The problem is that
xas_pause() advances the loop counter - thereby skipping that page.

What needs to happen is for xas_reset() to be called any time we decide we
don't want to process the page we're looking at, but rather send the
request we are building and start a new one.

Fix this by copying and adapting the netfslib writepages code as a
temporary measure, with cifs writeback intending to be offloaded to
netfslib in the near future.

This also fixes the issue with the use of filemap_get_folios_tag() causing
retry of a bunch of pages which the extender already dealt with.

This can be tested by creating, say, a 64K file somewhere not on cifs
(otherwise copy-offload may get underfoot), mounting a cifs share with a
wsize of 64000, copying the file to it and then comparing the original file
and the copy:

        dd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/64K bs=64k count=1
        mount //192.168.6.1/test /mnt -o user=...,pass=...,wsize=64000
        cp /tmp/64K /mnt/64K
        cmp /tmp/64K /mnt/64K

ASoC: SOF: ipc4-pcm: Workaround for crashed firmware on system suspend

When the system is suspended while audio is active, the
sof_ipc4_pcm_hw_free() is invoked to reset the pipelines since during
suspend the DSP is turned off, streams will be re-started after resume.

If the firmware crashes during while audio is running (or when we reset
the stream before suspend) then the sof_ipc4_set_multi_pipeline_state()
will fail with IPC error and the state change is interrupted.
This will cause misalignment between the kernel and firmware state on next
DSP boot resulting errors returned by firmware for IPC messages, eventually
failing the audio resume.
On stream close the errors are ignored so the kernel state will be
corrected on the next DSP boot, so the second boot after the DSP panic.

If sof_ipc4_trigger_pipelines() is called from sof_ipc4_pcm_hw_free() then
state parameter is SOF_IPC4_PIPE_RESET and only in this case.

Treat a forced pipeline reset similarly to how we treat a pcm_free by
ignoring error on state sending to allow the kernel's state to be
consistent with the state the firmware will have after the next boot."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Commit d5e01266e7f5 (""leds: trigger: netdev: add additional specific link

mode in commit cee4bd16c319 (""leds: trigger: netdev: Recheck

This changed the logic where, in the previous implementation the dev
from the trigger event was used to check if the carrier was ok, but in
the new implementation with the generic function, the dev in
trigger_data is used instead.

This is problematic and cause a possible kernel panic due to the fact
that the dev in the trigger_data still reference the old one as the
new one (passed from the trigger event) still has to be hold and saved
in the trigger_data struct (done in the NETDEV_REGISTER case).

On calling of get_device_state(), an invalid net_dev is used and this
cause a kernel panic.

To handle this correctly, move the call to get_device_state() after the
new net_dev is correctly set in trigger_data (in the NETDEV_REGISTER

btrfs: fix race when detecting delalloc ranges during fiemap

For fiemap we recently stopped locking the target extent range for the
whole duration of the fiemap call, in order to avoid a deadlock in a
scenario where the fiemap buffer happens to be a memory mapped range of
the same file. This use case is very unlikely to be useful in practice but
it may be triggered by fuzz testing (syzbot, etc).

This however introduced a race that makes us miss delalloc ranges for
file regions that are currently holes, so the caller of fiemap will not
be aware that there's data for some file regions. This can be quite
serious for some use cases - for example in coreutils versions before 9.0,
the cp program used fiemap to detect holes and data in the source file,
copying only regions with data (extents or delalloc) from the source file
to the destination file in order to preserve holes (see the documentation
for its --sparse command line option). This means that if cp was used
with a source file that had delalloc in a hole, the destination file could
end up without that data, which is effectively a data loss issue, if it
happened to hit the race described below.

The race happens like this:

1) Fiemap is called, without the FIEMAP_FLAG_SYNC flag, for a file that
   has delalloc in the file range [64M, 65M[, which is currently a hole;

2) Fiemap locks the inode in shared mode, then starts iterating the
   inode's subvolume tree searching for file extent items, without having
   the whole fiemap target range locked in the inode's io tree - the
   change introduced recently by commit b0ad381fa769 (""btrfs: fix
   deadlock with fiemap and extent locking""). It only locks ranges in
   the io tree when it finds a hole or prealloc extent since that
   commit;

3) Note that fiemap clones each leaf before using it, and this is to
   avoid deadlocks when locking a file range in the inode's io tree and
   the fiemap buffer is memory mapped to some file, because writing
   to the page with btrfs_page_mkwrite() will wait on any ordered extent
   for the page's range and the ordered extent needs to lock the range
   and may need to modify the same leaf, therefore leading to a deadlock
   on the leaf;

4) While iterating the file extent items in the cloned leaf before
   finding the hole in the range [64M, 65M[, the delalloc in that range
   is flushed and its ordered extent completes - meaning the corresponding
   file extent item is in the inode's subvolume tree, but not present in
   the cloned leaf that fiemap is iterating over;

5) When fiemap finds the hole in the [64M, 65M[ range by seeing the gap in
   the cloned leaf (or a file extent item with disk_bytenr == 0 in case
   the NO_HOLES feature is not enabled), it will lock that file range in
   the inode's io tree and then search for delalloc by checking for the
   EXTENT_DELALLOC bit in the io tree for that range and ordered extents
   (with btrfs_find_delalloc_in_range()). But it finds nothing since the
   delalloc in that range was already flushed and the ordered extent
   completed and is gone - as a result fiemap will not report that there's
   delalloc or an extent for the range [64M, 65M[, so user space will be
   mislead into thinking that there's a hole in that range.

This could actually be sporadically triggered with test case generic/094
from fstests, which reports a missing extent/delalloc range like this:

CVE-2024-32882	2024-05-02T07:15:20.967	2024-11-21T09:15:55.913	Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. In affected versions if a model has been made available for editing through the `wagtail.contrib.settings` module or `ModelViewSet`, and the `permission` argument on `FieldPanel` has been used to further restrict access to one or more fields of the model, a user with edit permission over the model but not the specific field can craft an HTTP POST request that bypasses the permission check on the individual field, allowing them to update its value. This vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin, or by a user who has not been granted edit access to the model in question. The editing interfaces for pages and snippets are also unaffected. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 6.0.3 and 6.1. Wagtail releases prior to 6.0 are unaffected. Users are advised to upgrade. Site owners who are unable to upgrade to a patched version can avoid the vulnerability as follows: 1.For models registered through `ModelViewSet`, register the model as a snippet instead; 2. For settings models, place the restricted fields in a separate settings model, and configure permission at the model level.	2.7	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N		
CVE-2024-32962	2024-05-02T07:15:21.420	2024-11-21T09:16:07.340	xml-crypto is an xml digital signature and encryption library for Node.js. In affected versions the default configuration does not check authorization of the signer, it only checks the validity of the signature per section 3.2.2 of the w3 xmldsig-core-20080610 spec. As such, without additional validation steps, the default configuration allows a malicious actor to re-sign an XML document, place the certificate in a `<KeyInfo />` element, and pass `xml-crypto` default validation checks. As a result `xml-crypto` trusts by default any certificate provided via digitally signed XML document's `<KeyInfo />`. `xml-crypto` prefers to use any certificate provided via digitally signed XML document's `<KeyInfo />` even if library was configured to use specific certificate (`publicCert`) for signature verification purposes.  An attacker can spoof signature verification by modifying XML document and replacing existing signature with signature generated with malicious private key (created by attacker) and by attaching that private key's certificate to `<KeyInfo />` element. This vulnerability is combination of changes introduced to `4.0.0` on pull request 301 / commit `c2b83f98` and has been addressed in version 6.0.0 with pull request 445 / commit `21201723d`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may either check the certificate extracted via `getCertFromKeyInfo` against trusted certificates before accepting the results of the validation or set `xml-crypto's getCertFromKeyInfo` to `() => undefined` forcing `xml-crypto` to use an explicitly configured `publicCert` or `privateKey` for signature verification.	10.0	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2024-32971	2024-05-02T07:15:21.733	2024-11-21T09:16:08.317	Apollo Router is a configurable, graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation 2. The affected versions of Apollo Router contain a bug that in limited circumstances, could lead to unexpected operations being executed which can result in unintended data or effects. This only affects Router instances configured to use distributed query plan caching. The root cause of this defect is a bug in Apollo Router’s cache retrieval logic: When this defect is present and distributed query planning caching is enabled, asking the Router to execute an operation (whether it is a query, a mutation, or a subscription) may result in an unexpected variation of that operation being executed or the generation of unexpected errors. The issue stems from inadvertently executing a modified version of a previously executed operation, whose query plan is stored in the underlying cache (specifically, Redis). Depending on the type of the operation, the result may vary. For a query, results may be fetched that don’t match what was requested (e.g., rather than running `fetchUsers(type: ENTERPRISE)` the Router may run `fetchUsers(type: TRIAL)`. For a mutation, this may result in incorrect mutations being sent to underlying subgraph servers (e.g., rather than sending `deleteUser(id: 10)` to a subgraph, the Router may run `deleteUser(id: 12)`. Users who are using distributed query plan caching, are advised to either upgrade to version 1.45.1 or above or downgrade to version 1.43.2 of the Apollo Router. Apollo Router versions 1.44.0 or 1.45.0 are not recommended for use and have been withdrawn. Users unable to upgrade can disable distributed query plan caching to mitigate this issue.	9.0	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

Due to improper sanitization of web app properties (such as name, description, shortcuts), web apps were able to inject additional lines into XDG Desktop Entries (on Linux) and `AppInfo.ini` (on PortableApps.com). This allowed malicious web apps to introduce keys like `Exec`, which could run arbitrary code when the affected web app was launched. This vulnerability affects all Linux and PortableApps.com users of all PWAsForFirefox versions up to (excluding) 2.12.0. Windows and macOS users are not affected. This vulnerability has been fixed in commit `9932d4b` which has been included in release in v2.12.0. The main fix is implemented in the native part, but the extension also contains additional fixes. All Linux and PortableApps.com users are advised to update to this version as soon as possible. It is also recommended for Windows and macOS users to update to this version, as it contains additional fixes related to properties sanitization. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	9.6	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

Versions 0.5.0 and 0.5.1 of vodozemac have degraded secret zeroization capabilities, due to changes in third-party cryptographic dependencies (the Dalek crates), which moved secret zeroization capabilities behind a feature flag and defaulted this feature to off. The degraded zeroization capabilities could result in the production of more memory copies of encryption secrets and secrets could linger in memory longer than necessary. This marginally increases the risk of sensitive data exposure. This issue has been addressed in version 0.6.0 and users are advised to upgrade.

IB/core: Fix a nested dead lock as part of ODP flow

Fix a nested dead lock as part of ODP flow by using mmput_async().

From the below call trace [1] can see that calling mmput() once we have
the umem_odp->umem_mutex locked as required by
ib_umem_odp_map_dma_and_lock() might trigger in the same task the
exit_mmap()->__mmu_notifier_release()->mlx5_ib_invalidate_range() which
may dead lock when trying to lock the same mutex.

Moving to use mmput_async() will solve the problem as the above
exit_mmap() flow will be called in other task and will be executed once
the lock will be available.

four attributes: SEG6_ATTR_HMACKEYID, SEG6_ATTR_SECRET, SEG6_ATTR_SECRETLEN and

by pf->cinst and sets this pointer to NULL. During the module
removal i40e_remove() calls i40e_lan_del_device() that dereferences
pf->cinst that is NULL -> crash.
Do not remove client instance when client open callbacks fails and
just clear __I40E_CLIENT_INSTANCE_OPENED bit. The driver also needs
to take care about this situation (when netdev is up and client
is NOT opened) in i40e_notify_client_of_netdev_close() and
calls client close callback only when __I40E_CLIENT_INSTANCE_OPENED

tcp: TX zerocopy should not sense pfmemalloc status

We got a recent syzbot report [1] showing a possible misuse
of pfmemalloc page status in TCP zerocopy paths.

Indeed, for pages coming from user space or other layers,
using page_is_pfmemalloc() is moot, and possibly could give
false positives.

There has been attempts to make page_is_pfmemalloc() more robust,
but not using it in the first place in this context is probably better,
removing cpu cycles.

Note to stable teams :

You need to backport 84ce071e38a6 (""net: introduce
__skb_fill_page_desc_noacc"") as a prereq.

Race is more probable after commit c07aea3ef4d4
(""mm: add a signature in struct page"") because page_is_pfmemalloc()
is now using low order bit from page->lru.next, which can change
more often than page->index.

Low order bit should never be set for lru.next (when used as an anchor
in LRU list), so KCSAN report is mostly a false positive.

Backporting to older kernel versions seems not necessary.

ALSA: emu10k1: Fix out of bounds access in snd_emu10k1_pcm_channel_alloc()

The voice allocator sometimes begins allocating from near the end of the
array and then wraps around, however snd_emu10k1_pcm_channel_alloc()
accesses the newly allocated voices as if it never wrapped around.

This results in out of bounds access if the first voice has a high enough
index so that first_voice + requested_voice_count > NUM_G (64).
The more voices are requested, the more likely it is for this to occur.

If a string contains a forbidden substring (i.e. `__proto__`) followed by a space character, the code will access a special property in `MarkovData#finalData` by removing the last character of the string, bypassing the dataset sanitization (as it is supposed to be already sanitized before this function is called).

CVE-2024-34064	2024-05-06T15:15:23.803	2025-09-08T19:27:31.120	Jinja is an extensible templating engine. The `xmlattr` filter in affected versions of Jinja accepts keys containing non-attribute characters. XML/HTML attributes cannot contain spaces, `/`, `>`, or `=`, as each would then be interpreted as starting a separate attribute. If an application accepts keys (as opposed to only values) as user input, and renders these in pages that other users see as well, an attacker could use this to inject other attributes and perform XSS. The fix for CVE-2024-22195 only addressed spaces but not other characters. Accepting keys as user input is now explicitly considered an unintended use case of the `xmlattr` filter, and code that does so without otherwise validating the input should be flagged as insecure, regardless of Jinja version. Accepting _values_ as user input continues to be safe. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.4.	5.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N		
CVE-2024-34069	2024-05-06T15:15:23.990	2025-02-21T18:15:16.663	Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. The debugger in affected versions of Werkzeug can allow an attacker to execute code on a developer's machine under some circumstances. This requires the attacker to get the developer to interact with a domain and subdomain they control, and enter the debugger PIN, but if they are successful it allows access to the debugger even if it is only running on localhost. This also requires the attacker to guess a URL in the developer's application that will trigger the debugger. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.0.3.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

In Eclipse Dataspace Components from version 0.2.1 to 0.6.2, we have identified a security vulnerability in the EDC Connector component ( https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector ) regarding the OAuth2-protected data sink feature. When using a custom, OAuth2-protected data sink, the OAuth2-specific data address properties are resolved by the provider data plane. Problematically, the consumer-provided clientSecretKey, which indicates the OAuth2 client secret to retrieve from a secrets vault, is resolved in the context of the provider's vault, not the consumer. This secret's value is then sent to the tokenUrl, also consumer-controlled, as part of an OAuth2 client credentials grant. The returned access token is then sent as a bearer token to the data sink URL.

This feature is now disabled entirely, because not all code paths necessary for a successful realization were fully implemented.

CVE-2024-29209	2024-05-07T17:15:08.490	2024-11-21T09:07:49.460	"A medium severity vulnerability has been identified in the update mechanism of the Phish Alert Button for Outlook, which could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the host machine. The vulnerability arises from the application's failure to securely verify the authenticity and integrity of the update server.

The application periodically checks for updates by querying a specific URL. However, this process does not enforce strict SSL/TLS verification, nor does it validate the digital signature of the received update files. An attacker with the capability to perform DNS spoofing can exploit this weakness. By manipulating DNS responses, the attacker can redirect the application's update requests to a malicious server under their control.

Once the application queries the spoofed update URL, the malicious server can respond with a crafted update package. Since the application fails to properly verify the authenticity of the update file, it will accept and execute the package, leading to arbitrary code execution on the host machine.

Impact:
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute code with elevated privileges, potentially leading to data theft, installation of further malware, or other malicious activities on the host system.

Affected Products:
Phish Alert Button (PAB) for Outlook versions 1.10.0-1.10.11
Second Chance Client versions 2.0.0-2.0.9
PIQ Client versions 1.0.0-1.0.15

Remediation:
Automated updates will be pushed to address this issue. Users of affected versions should verify the latest version is applied and, if not, apply the latest updates provided by KnowBe4, which addresses this vulnerability by implementing proper SSL/TLS checks of the update server. It is also recommended to ensure DNS settings are secure to prevent DNS spoofing attacks.

Workarounds:
Use secure corporate networks or VPN services to secure network communications, which can help mitigate the risk of DNS spoofing.

CVE-2024-29210	2024-05-07T17:15:08.647	2024-11-21T09:07:49.607	"A local privilege escalation (LPE) vulnerability has been identified in Phish Alert Button for Outlook (PAB), specifically within its configuration management functionalities. This vulnerability allows a regular user to modify the application's configuration file to redirect update checks to an arbitrary server, which can then be exploited in conjunction with CVE-2024-29209 to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

The issue stems from improper permission settings on the application's configuration file, which is stored in a common directory accessible to all users. This file includes critical parameters, such as the update server URL. By default, the application does not enforce adequate access controls on this file, allowing non-privileged users to modify it without administrative consent.

An attacker with regular user access can alter the update server URL specified in the configuration file to point to a malicious server. When the application performs its next update check, it will contact the attacker-controlled server. If the system is also vulnerable to CVE-2024-29209, the attacker can deliver a malicious update package that, when executed, grants them elevated privileges.

Impact:
This vulnerability can lead to a regular user executing code with administrative privileges. This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, installation of additional malware, and a full takeover of the affected system.

Affected Products:
Phish Alert Button (PAB) for Outlook versions 1.10.0-1.10.11
Second Chance Client versions 2.0.0-2.0.9
PIQ Client versions 1.0.0-1.0.15

Remediation:
KnowBe4 has released a patch that corrects the permission settings on the configuration file to prevent unauthorized modifications. Automated updates will be pushed to address this issue. Users of affected versions should verify the latest version is applied and, if not, apply the latest updates provided by KnowBe4.

Workarounds:
Manually set the correct permissions on the configuration file to restrict write access to administrators only.

CVE-2024-34346	2024-05-07T21:15:09.270	2025-09-04T19:23:06.737	"Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure defaults. The Deno sandbox may be unexpectedly weakened by allowing file read/write access to privileged files in various locations on Unix and Windows platforms. For example, reading `/proc/self/environ` may provide access equivalent to `--allow-env`, and writing `/proc/self/mem` may provide access equivalent to `--allow-all`. Users who grant read and write access to the entire filesystem may not realize that these access to these files may have additional, unintended consequences. The documentation did not reflect that this practice should be undertaken to increase the strength of the security sandbox. Users who run code with `--allow-read` or `--allow-write` may unexpectedly end up granting additional permissions via file-system operations. Deno 1.43 and above require explicit `--allow-all` access to read or write `/etc`, `/dev` on unix platform (as well as `/proc` and `/sys` on linux platforms), and any path starting with `\\` on Windows.

There are issues with the D-Bus interface long before Polkit is invoked. The `org.rpm.dnf.v0.SessionManager.open_session` method takes a key/value map of configuration entries. A sub-entry in this map, placed under the ""config"" key, is another key/value map. The configuration values found in it will be forwarded as configuration overrides to the `libdnf5::Base` configuration. 

Practically all libdnf5 configuration aspects can be influenced here. Already when opening the session via D-Bus, the libdnf5 will be initialized using these override configuration values. There is no sanity checking of the content of this ""config"" map, which is untrusted data. It is possible to make the library loading a plug-in shared library under control of an unprivileged user, hence achieving root access.

CVE-2024-2746	2024-05-08T02:15:09.677	2024-11-21T09:10:25.433	"Incomplete fix for CVE-2024-1929

The problem with CVE-2024-1929 was that the dnf5 D-Bus daemon accepted arbitrary configuration parameters from unprivileged users, which allowed a
local root exploit by tricking the daemon into loading a user controlled ""plugin"". All of this happened before Polkit authentication was even started.

The dnf5 library code does not check whether non-root users control the directory in question. 

On one hand, this poses a Denial-of-Service attack vector by making the daemonoperate on a blocking file (e.g. named FIFO special file) or a very large file
that causes an out-of-memory situation (e.g. /dev/zero). On the other hand, this can be used to let the daemon process privileged files like /etc/shadow.
The file in question is parsed as an INI file. Error diagnostics resulting from parsing privileged files could cause information leaks, if these diagnostics
are accessible to unprivileged users. In the case of libdnf5, no such user accessible diagnostics should exist, though.

Also, a local attacker can place a valid repository configuration file in this directory. This configuration file allows to specify
a plethora of additional configuration options. This makes various additional code paths in libdnf5 accessible to the attacker."	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

Prior to 0.8.0, the @hoppscotch/js-sandbox package provides a Javascript sandbox that uses the Node.js vm module. However, the vm module is not safe for sandboxing untrusted Javascript code. This is because code inside the vm context can break out if it can get a hold of any reference to an object created outside of the vm. In the case of @hoppscotch/js-sandbox, multiple references to external objects are passed into the vm context to allow pre-request scripts interactions with environment variables and more. But this also allows the pre-request script to escape the sandbox. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.8.0.	8.3	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2024-28866	2024-05-14T15:14:46.727	2025-08-04T14:43:31.513	"GoCD is a continuous delivery server. GoCD versions from 19.4.0 to 23.5.0 (inclusive) are potentially vulnerable to a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability on the loading page displayed while GoCD is starting, via abuse of a `redirect_to` query parameter with inadequate validation.

Attackers could theoretically abuse the query parameter to steal session tokens or other values from the user's browser. In practice exploiting this to perform privileged actions is likely rather difficult to exploit because the target user would need to be triggered to open an attacker-crafted link in the period where the server is starting up (but not completely started), requiring chaining with a separate denial-of-service vulnerability. Additionally, GoCD server restarts invalidate earlier session tokens (i.e GoCD does not support persistent sessions), so a stolen session token would be unusable once the server has completed restart, and executed XSS would be done within a logged-out context.

The issue is fixed in GoCD 24.1.0. As a workaround, it is technically possible in earlier GoCD versions to override the loading page with an earlier version which is not vulnerable, by starting GoCD with the Java system property override as either `-Dloading.page.resource.path=/loading_pages/default.loading.page.html` (simpler early version of loading page without GoCD introduction) or `-Dloading.page.resource.path=/does_not_exist.html` (to display a simple message with no interactivity)."	3.1	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

CVE-2024-32655	2024-05-14T15:36:51.087	2024-12-12T21:15:08.060	Npgsql is the .NET data provider for PostgreSQL. The `WriteBind()` method in `src/Npgsql/Internal/NpgsqlConnector.FrontendMessages.cs` uses `int` variables to store the message length and the sum of parameter lengths. Both variables overflow when the sum of parameter lengths becomes too large. This causes Npgsql to write a message size that is too small when constructing a Postgres protocol message to send it over the network to the database. When parsing the message, the database will only read a small number of bytes and treat any following bytes as new messages while they belong to the old message. Attackers can abuse this to inject arbitrary Postgres protocol messages into the connection, leading to the execution of arbitrary SQL statements on the application's behalf. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.0.14, 4.1.13, 5.0.18, 6.0.11, 7.0.7, and 8.0.3.	8.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Prior to 2.1.9, a Stored Blind Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the Failed Login Attempts Logging Feature of the Froxlor Application. An unauthenticated User can inject malicious scripts in the loginname parameter on the Login attempt, which will then be executed when viewed by the Administrator in the System Logs.  By exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker can perform various malicious actions such as forcing the Administrator to execute actions without their knowledge or consent. For instance, the attacker can force the Administrator to add a new administrator controlled by the attacker, thereby giving the attacker full control over the application. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.1.9.

Insufficient access control in the registration and password reset process allows an attacker to reset another user's password and takeover their account, if the victim has an incomplete request pending. The exploit is only possible while the verification token is valid, i.e for 5 minutes after the confirmation URL sent by e-mail has been opened, and the user did not complete the process by updating their password. A brute-force attack calling account_update.php with increasing user IDs is possible. A successful takeover would grant the attacker full access to the compromised account, including sensitive information and functionalities associated with the account, the extent of which depends on its privileges and the data it has access to. Version 2.26.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may mitigate the risk by reducing the verification token's validity (change the value of the `TOKEN_EXPIRY_AUTHENTICATED` constant in `constants_inc.php`).	7.3	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

CVE-2024-34340	2024-05-14T15:38:39.517	2024-12-18T20:44:22.890	Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework. Prior to version 1.2.27, Cacti calls `compat_password_hash` when users set their password. `compat_password_hash` use `password_hash` if there is it, else use `md5`. When verifying password, it calls `compat_password_verify`. In `compat_password_verify`, `password_verify` is called if there is it, else use `md5`. `password_verify` and `password_hash` are supported on PHP < 5.5.0, following PHP manual. The vulnerability is in `compat_password_verify`. Md5-hashed user input is compared with correct password in database by `$md5 == $hash`. It is a loose comparison, not `===`. It is a type juggling vulnerability. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch for the issue.	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

CVE-2024-34350	2024-05-14T15:38:41.890	2025-09-10T15:36:59.130	Next.js is a React framework that can provide building blocks to create web applications. Prior to 13.5.1, an inconsistent interpretation of a crafted HTTP request meant that requests are treated as both a single request, and two separate requests by Next.js, leading to desynchronized responses. This led to a response queue poisoning vulnerability in the affected Next.js versions. For a request to be exploitable, the affected route also had to be making use of the [rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites) feature in Next.js. The vulnerability is resolved in Next.js `13.5.1` and newer.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was identified in Next.js Server Actions. If the `Host` header is modified, and the below conditions are also met, an attacker may be able to make requests that appear to be originating from the Next.js application server itself. The required conditions are 1) Next.js is running in a self-hosted manner; 2) the Next.js application makes use of Server Actions; and 3) the Server Action performs a redirect to a relative path which starts with a `/`. This vulnerability was fixed in Next.js `14.1.1`.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

In Matrix, the server-side `key backup` stores encrypted copies of Matrix message keys. This facilitates key sharing between a user's devices and provides a redundant copy in case all devices are lost. The key backup uses asymmetric
cryptography, with each server-side key backup assigned a unique public-private key pair. Due to a logic bug introduced in commit 71136e44c03c79f80d6d1a2446673bc4d53a2067, matrix-sdk-crypto version 0.7.0 will sometimes log the private part of the backup key pair to Rust debug logs (using the `tracing` crate).

The `__init__` constructor built in the `Llama` takes several parameters to configure the loading and running of the model. Other than `NUMA, LoRa settings`, `loading tokenizers,` and `hardware settings`, `__init__` also loads the `chat template` from targeted `.gguf` 's Metadata and furtherly parses it to `llama_chat_format.Jinja2ChatFormatter.to_chat_handler()` to construct the `self.chat_handler` for this model. Nevertheless, `Jinja2ChatFormatter` parse the `chat template` within the Metadate with sandbox-less `jinja2.Environment`, which is furthermore rendered in `__call__` to construct the `prompt` of interaction. This allows `jinja2` Server Side Template Injection which leads to remote code execution by a carefully constructed payload.	9.6	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

ATXs are expected to form a single chain from the newest to the first ATX ever published by an identity. Allowing Smeshers to reference an earlier (but not the latest) ATX as previous breaks this protocol rule and can serve as an attack vector where Nodes are rewarded for holding their PoST data for less than one epoch but still being eligible for rewards.

CVE-2024-34697	2024-05-14T15:39:27.240	2025-01-10T15:13:34.317	FreeScout is a free, self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. A stored HTML Injection vulnerability has been identified in the Email Receival Module of the Freescout Application. The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious HTML content into emails sent to the application's mailbox. This vulnerability arises from improper handling of HTML content within incoming emails, allowing attackers to embed malicious HTML code in the context of the application's domain. Unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious HTML content into emails. This could lead to various attacks such as form hijacking, application defacement, or data exfiltration via CSS injection. Although unauthenticated attackers are limited to HTML injection, the consequences can still be severe. Version 1.8.139 implements strict input validation and sanitization mechanisms to ensure that any HTML content received via emails is properly sanitized to prevent malicious HTML injections.	7.6	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L		
CVE-2024-34698	2024-05-14T15:39:27.840	2025-01-10T15:11:33.890	FreeScout is a free, self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Versions of FreeScout prior to 1.8.139 contain a Prototype Pollution vulnerability in the `/public/js/main.js` source file. The Prototype Pollution arises because the `getQueryParam` Function recursively merges an object containing user-controllable properties into an existing object (For URL Query Parameters Parsing), without first sanitizing the keys. This can allow an attacker to inject a property with a key `__proto__`, along with arbitrarily nested properties. The merge operation assigns the nested properties to the `params` object's prototype instead of the target object itself. As a result, the attacker can pollute the prototype with properties containing harmful values, which are then inherited by user-defined objects and subsequently used by the application dangerously. The vulnerability lets an attacker control properties of objects that would otherwise be inaccessible. If the application subsequently handles an attacker-controlled property in an unsafe way, this can potentially be chained with other vulnerabilities like DOM-based XSS, Open Redirection, Cookie Manipulation, Link Manipulation, HTML Injection, etc. Version 1.8.139 contains a patch for the issue.	4.6	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

It is possible for users to be considered as the requester of a specific wiki request if their local user ID on any wiki in a wiki farm matches the local ID of the requester at the wiki where the wiki request was made. This allows them to go to that request entry's on Special:RequestWikiQueue on the wiki where their local user ID matches and take any actions that the wiki requester is allowed to take from there.

Commit 02e0f298f8d35155c39aa74193cb7b867432c5b8 fixes the issue. Important note about the fix: This vulnerability has been fixed by disabling access to the REST API and special pages outside of the wiki configured as the ""global wiki"" in `$wgCreateWikiGlobalWiki` in a user's MediaWiki settings.

As a workaround, it is possible to disable the special pages outside of one's own global wiki by doing something similar to `miraheze/mw-config` commit e5664995fbb8644f9a80b450b4326194f20f9ddc that is adapted to one's own setup. As for the REST API, before the fix, there wasn't any REST endpoint that allowed one to make writes. Regardless, it is possible to also disable it outside of the global wiki by using `$wgCreateWikiDisableRESTAPI` and `$wgConf` in the configuration for one's own wiki farm.."	5.9	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

The problem occurred during instruction selection in the `DAGCombine` phase while visiting the XOR operation. The issue arises when attempting to fold the expression `!(x cc y)` into `(x !cc y)`. To perform this transformation, the second operand of XOR should be a constant representing the true value. However, it was incorrectly assumed that -1 represents the true value, when in fact, 1 is the correct representation, so this transformation for this case should be skipped.

An attacker can retrieve personal information from this token, or use it to execute requests to the Valtimo REST API on behalf of the logged-in user. This issue is caused by a misconfiguration of the Form.io component.

The following conditions have to be met in order to perform this attack: An attacker needs to have access to the network traffic on the `api.form.io` domain; the content of the `x-jwt-token` header is logged or otherwise available to the attacker; an attacker needs to have network access to the Valtimo API; and an attacker needs to act within the time-to-live of the access token.

The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()` in `index.js` because the pattern `.*` will greedily match anything.

As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persists. This issue should be mitigated by using a safe pattern that won't start backtracking the regular expression due to greedy matching.

This fundamentally allows any site running on the browser with the extension installed to bypass CORS restrictions if the user is running extensions with the given version. This security hole was patched in the commit 7e364b928ab722dc682d0fcad713a96cc38477d6 which was released along with the extension version `0.35`. As a workaround, Chrome users can use the Extensions Settings to disable the extension access to only the origins that you want. Firefox doesn't have an alternative to upgrading to a fixed version."	7.6	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H		
CVE-2024-34716	2024-05-14T16:17:28.073	2025-01-21T16:06:58.623	PrestaShop is an open source e-commerce web application. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that only affects PrestaShops with customer-thread feature flag enabled is present starting from PrestaShop 8.1.0 and prior to PrestaShop 8.1.6. When the customer thread feature flag is enabled through the front-office contact form, a hacker can upload a malicious file containing an XSS that will be executed when an admin opens the attached file in back office. The script injected can access the session and the security token, which allows it to perform any authenticated action in the scope of the administrator's right. This vulnerability is patched in 8.1.6. A workaround is to disable the customer-thread feature-flag.	9.6	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

If the source repository is owned by a different user, then those hardlinked files may be rewritten at any point in time by the untrusted user. Cloning local repositories will cause Git to either copy or hardlink files of the source repository into the target repository. This significantly speeds up such local clones compared to doing a ""proper"" clone and saves both disk space and compute time. When cloning a repository located on the same disk that is owned by a different user than the current user we also end up creating such hardlinks. These files will continue to be owned and controlled by the potentially-untrusted user and can be rewritten by them at will in the future.

Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, when cloning a local source repository that contains symlinks via the filesystem, Git may create hardlinks to arbitrary user-readable files on the same filesystem as the target repository in the `objects/` directory. Cloning a local repository over the filesystem may creating hardlinks to arbitrary user-owned files on the same filesystem in the target Git repository's `objects/` directory. When cloning a repository over the filesystem (without explicitly specifying the `file://` protocol or `--no-local`), the optimizations for local cloning
will be used, which include attempting to hard link the object files instead of copying them. While the code includes checks against symbolic links in the source repository, which were added during the fix for CVE-2022-39253, these checks can still be raced because the hard link operation ultimately follows symlinks. If the object on the filesystem appears as a file during the check, and then a symlink during the operation, this will allow the adversary to bypass the check and create hardlinks in the destination objects directory to arbitrary, user-readable files.

The Git project recommends to avoid working in untrusted repositories, and instead to clone it first with `git clone --no-local` to obtain a clean copy. Git has specific protections to make that a safe operation even with an untrusted source repository, but vulnerabilities allow those protections to be bypassed. In the context of cloning local repositories owned by other users, this vulnerability has been covered in CVE-2024-32004. But there are circumstances where the fixes for CVE-2024-32004 are not enough: For example, when obtaining a `.zip` file containing a full copy of a Git repository, it should not be trusted by default to be safe, as e.g. hooks could be configured to run within the context of that repository.

enable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the
 designated target folder. The routine `untarFile` attempts to guard against creating symbolic links that point outside the directory a tar archive is extracted to. However, a malicious tarball first linking `subdir/parent` to `..` (allowed, because `subdir/..` falls within the archive root) and then linking `subdir/parent/escapes` to `..` results in a symbolic link pointing to the tarball’s parent directory, contrary to the routine’s goals. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive file. Additionally, if the attacker has read access to the unpacked files, they may be able to read arbitrary system files the parent process has permissions to read.

Any users of sshpiper who need logs from it for whitelisting/rate limiting/security investigations could have them become much less useful if an attacker is sending a spoofed source address. Version 1.3.0 contains a patch for the issue.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

Prior to version 2.1.0.28, SQL injection is possible when using the non-default connection property `preferQueryMode=simple` in combination with application code which has a vulnerable SQL that negates a parameter value. There is no vulnerability in the driver when using the default, extended query mode. Note that `preferQueryMode` is not a supported parameter in Redshift JDBC driver, and is inherited code from Postgres JDBC driver. Users who do not override default settings to utilize this unsupported query mode are not affected. This issue is patched in driver version 2.1.0.28. As a workaround, do not use the connection property `preferQueryMode=simple`. (NOTE: Those who do not explicitly specify a query mode use the default of extended query mode and are not affected by this issue.)	10.0	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2024-34082	2024-05-15T17:15:12.703	2025-01-02T23:06:29.123	Grav is a file-based Web platform. Prior to version 1.7.46, a low privilege user account with page edit privilege can read any server files using Twig Syntax. This includes Grav user account files - `/grav/user/accounts/*.yaml`. This file stores hashed user password, 2FA secret, and the password reset token. This can allow an adversary to compromise any registered account and read any file in the web server by resetting a password for a user to get access to the password reset token from the file or by cracking the hashed password. A low privileged user may also perform a full account takeover of other registered users including Administrators. Version 1.7.46 contains a patch.	8.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L

CVE-2024-35183	2024-05-15T22:15:08.580	2024-11-21T09:19:53.180	wolfictl is a command line tool for working with Wolfi. A git authentication issue in versions prior to 0.16.10 allows a local user’s GitHub token to be sent to remote servers other than `github.com`. Most git-dependent functionality in wolfictl relies on its own `git` package, which contains centralized logic for implementing interactions with git repositories. Some of this functionality requires authentication in order to access private repositories. A central function `GetGitAuth` looks for a GitHub token in the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` and returns it as an HTTP basic auth object to be used with the `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5` library. Most callers (direct or indirect) of `GetGitAuth` use the token to authenticate to github.com only; however, in some cases callers were passing this authentication without checking that the remote git repository was hosted on github.com. This behavior has existed in one form or another since commit 0d06e1578300327c212dda26a5ab31d09352b9d0 - committed January 25, 2023. This impacts anyone who ran the `wolfictl check update` commands with a Melange configuration that included a `git-checkout` directive step that referenced a git repository not hosted on github.com. This also impacts anyone who ran `wolfictl update <url>` with a remote URL outside of github.com. Additionally, these subcommands must have run with the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable set to a valid GitHub token. Users should upgrade to version 0.16.10 to receive a patch.	4.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

The vulnerability arises from the application's handling of artifact URLs, where a '#' character can be used to insert a path into the fragment, effectively skipping validation. This allows an attacker to construct a URL that, when processed, ignores the protocol scheme and uses the provided path for filesystem access. As a result, an attacker can read arbitrary files, including sensitive information such as SSH and cloud keys, by exploiting the way the application converts the URL into a filesystem path. The issue stems from insufficient validation of the fragment portion of the URL, leading to arbitrary file read through path traversal.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2024-3851	2024-05-16T09:15:14.823	2025-05-19T16:13:38.820	A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the 'imartinez/privategpt' repository due to improper validation of file uploads.

CVE-2024-4263	2024-05-16T09:15:16.037	2025-02-03T15:55:20.030	A broken access control vulnerability exists in mlflow/mlflow versions before 2.10.1, where low privilege users with only EDIT permissions on an experiment can delete any artifacts. This issue arises due to the lack of proper validation for DELETE requests by users with EDIT permissions, allowing them to perform unauthorized deletions of artifacts. The vulnerability specifically affects the handling of artifact deletions within the application, as demonstrated by the ability of a low privilege user to delete a directory inside an artifact using a DELETE request, despite the official documentation stating that users with EDIT permission can only read and update artifacts, not delete them.	5.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L		
CVE-2024-4321	2024-05-16T09:15:16.327	2025-07-10T16:21:16.573	A Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability exists in the gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt application, specifically within the functionality for uploading chat history. The vulnerability arises due to improper input validation when handling file paths during the chat history upload process. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by intercepting requests and manipulating the 'name' parameter to specify arbitrary file paths. This allows the attacker to read sensitive files on the server, leading to information leakage, including API keys and private information. The issue affects version 20240310 of the application.					
CVE-2024-4322	2024-05-16T09:15:16.613	2025-07-09T14:32:00.963	A path traversal vulnerability exists in the parisneo/lollms-webui application, specifically within the `/list_personalities` endpoint. By manipulating the `category` parameter, an attacker can traverse the directory structure and list any directory on the system. This issue affects the latest version of the application. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the `list_personalities` function, where the `category` parameter can be controlled to specify arbitrary directories for listing. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to list all folders in the drive on the system, potentially leading to information disclosure.					
CVE-2024-4326	2024-05-16T09:15:16.887	2025-07-09T14:29:46.210	A vulnerability in parisneo/lollms-webui versions up to 9.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability stems from insufficient protection of the `/apply_settings` and `/execute_code` endpoints. Attackers can bypass protections by setting the host to localhost, enabling code execution, and disabling code validation through the `/apply_settings` endpoint. Subsequently, arbitrary commands can be executed remotely via the `/execute_code` endpoint, exploiting the delay in settings enforcement. This issue was addressed in version 9.5.

CVE-2023-46842	2024-05-16T14:15:08.317	2025-04-30T23:15:59.920	"Unlike 32-bit PV guests, HVM guests may switch freely between 64-bit and
other modes.  This in particular means that they may set registers used
to pass 32-bit-mode hypercall arguments to values outside of the range
32-bit code would be able to set them to.

When processing of hypercalls takes a considerable amount of time,
the hypervisor may choose to invoke a hypercall continuation.  Doing so
involves putting (perhaps updated) hypercall arguments in respective
registers.  For guests not running in 64-bit mode this further involves
a certain amount of translation of the values.

Unfortunately internal sanity checking of these translated values
assumes high halves of registers to always be clear when invoking a
hypercall.  When this is found not to be the case, it triggers a
consistency check in the hypervisor and causes a crash.

However, it is possible to inject additional commands into these checks because strings from TACACS+ packets are used as command-line arguments. If the installation lacks a a pre-shared secret (there is no pre-shared secret by default), then the injection can be triggered without authentication.

CVE-2024-35185	2024-05-16T16:15:09.990	2024-11-21T09:19:53.460	Minder is a software supply chain security platform. Prior to version 0.0.49, the Minder REST ingester is vulnerable to a denial of service attack via an attacker-controlled REST endpoint that can crash the Minder server. The REST ingester allows users to interact with REST endpoints to fetch data for rule evaluation. When fetching data with the REST ingester, Minder sends a request to an endpoint and will use the data from the body of the response as the data to evaluate against a certain rule. If the response is sufficiently large, it can drain memory on the machine and crash the Minder server. The attacker can control the remote REST endpoints that Minder sends requests to, and they can configure the remote REST endpoints to return responses with large bodies. They would then instruct Minder to send a request to their configured endpoint that would return the large response which would crash the Minder server. Version 0.0.49 fixes this issue.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2024-35187	2024-05-16T16:15:10.230	2024-11-21T09:19:53.717	Stalwart Mail Server is an open-source mail server. Prior to version 0.8.0, attackers who achieved Arbitrary Code Execution as the stalwart-mail user (including web interface admins) can gain complete root access to the system. Usually, system services are run as a separate user (not as root) to isolate an attacker with Arbitrary Code Execution to the current service. Therefore, other system services and the system itself remains protected in case of a successful attack. stalwart-mail runs as a separate user, but it can give itself full privileges again in a simple way, so this protection is practically ineffective. Server admins who handed out the admin credentials to the mail server, but didn't want to hand out complete root access to the system, as well as any attacked user when the attackers gained Arbitrary Code Execution using another vulnerability, may be vulnerable. Version 0.8.0 contains a patch for the issue.	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2024-4603	2024-05-16T16:15:10.643	2024-11-21T09:43:11.753	"Issue summary: Checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters may be very
slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions EVP_PKEY_param_check()
or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check a DSA public key or DSA parameters may
experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked
have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of
Service.

The functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() perform
various checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long time
if the modulus (`p` parameter) is too large.

Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not allow using
public keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length for signature
verification. However the key and parameter check functions do not limit
the modulus size when performing the checks.

An application that calls EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check()
and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be
vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

These functions are not called by OpenSSL itself on untrusted DSA keys so
only applications that directly call these functions may be vulnerable.

Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applications
when using the `-check` option.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue."	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

usb: gadget: ncm: Avoid dropping datagrams of properly parsed NTBs

It is observed sometimes when tethering is used over NCM with Windows 11
as host, at some instances, the gadget_giveback has one byte appended at
the end of a proper NTB. When the NTB is parsed, unwrap call looks for
any leftover bytes in SKB provided by u_ether and if there are any pending
bytes, it treats them as a separate NTB and parses it. But in case the
second NTB (as per unwrap call) is faulty/corrupt, all the datagrams that
were parsed properly in the first NTB and saved in rx_list are dropped.

Adding a few custom traces showed the following:
[002] d..1  7828.532866: dwc3_gadget_giveback: ep1out:
req 000000003868811a length 1025/16384 zsI ==> 0
[002] d..1  7828.532867: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb toprocess: 1025
[002] d..1  7828.532867: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb nth: 1751999342
[002] d..1  7828.532868: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb seq: 0xce67
[002] d..1  7828.532868: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb blk_len: 0x400
[002] d..1  7828.532868: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb ndp_len: 0x10
[002] d..1  7828.532869: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: Parsed NTB with 1 frames

In this case, the giveback is of 1025 bytes and block length is 1024.
The rest 1 byte (which is 0x00) won't be parsed resulting in drop of
all datagrams in rx_list.

Same is case with packets of size 2048:
[002] d..1  7828.557948: dwc3_gadget_giveback: ep1out:
req 0000000011dfd96e length 2049/16384 zsI ==> 0
[002] d..1  7828.557949: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb nth: 1751999342
[002] d..1  7828.557950: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb blk_len: 0x800

Lecroy shows one byte coming in extra confirming that the byte is coming
in from PC:

 Transfer 2959 - Bytes Transferred(1025)  Timestamp((18.524 843 590)
 - Transaction 8391 - Data(1025 bytes) Timestamp(18.524 843 590)

       Data(1 byte)
       Duration(66.160ns) Time(282.000ns) Timestamp(18.524 845 722)

According to Windows driver, no ZLP is needed if wBlockLength is non-zero,
because the non-zero wBlockLength has already told the function side the
size of transfer to be expected. However, there are in-market NCM devices
that rely on ZLP as long as the wBlockLength is multiple of wMaxPacketSize.
To deal with such devices, it pads an extra 0 at end so the transfer is no
longer multiple of wMaxPacketSize."	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

rtnetlink: fix error logic of IFLA_BRIDGE_FLAGS writing back

In the commit d73ef2d69c0d (""rtnetlink: let rtnl_bridge_setlink checks

in the function `rtnl_bridge_setlink` to enable the loop to also check
the length of the IFLA_BRIDGE_MODE attribute. However, this adjustment
removed the `break` statement and led to an error logic of the flags

Before the mentioned commit, the `attr` is granted to be IFLA_BRIDGE_FLAGS.
However, this is not necessarily true fow now as the updated loop will let
the attr point to the last NLA, even an invalid NLA which could cause
overflow writes.

netfilter: bridge: confirm multicast packets before passing them up the stack

conntrack nf_confirm logic cannot handle cloned skbs referencing
the same nf_conn entry, which will happen for multicast (broadcast)
frames on bridges.

 Example:
    macvlan0
       |
      br0
     /  \
  ethX    ethY

 ethX (or Y) receives a L2 multicast or broadcast packet containing
 an IP packet, flow is not yet in conntrack table.

 1. skb passes through bridge and fake-ip (br_netfilter)Prerouting.
    -> skb->_nfct now references a unconfirmed entry
 2. skb is broad/mcast packet. bridge now passes clones out on each bridge
    interface.
 3. skb gets passed up the stack.
 4. In macvlan case, macvlan driver retains clone(s) of the mcast skb
    and schedules a work queue to send them out on the lower devices.

    The clone skb->_nfct is not a copy, it is the same entry as the
    original skb.  The macvlan rx handler then returns RX_HANDLER_PASS.
 5. Normal conntrack hooks (in NF_INET_LOCAL_IN) confirm the orig skb.

The Macvlan broadcast worker and normal confirm path will race.

This race will not happen if step 2 already confirmed a clone. In that
case later steps perform skb_clone() with skb->_nfct already confirmed (in
hash table).  This works fine.

But such confirmation won't happen when eb/ip/nftables rules dropped the
packets before they reached the nf_confirm step in postrouting.

Pablo points out that nf_conntrack_bridge doesn't allow use of stateful
nat, so we can safely discard the nf_conn entry and let inet call
conntrack again.

This doesn't work for bridge netfilter: skb could have a nat
transformation. Also bridge nf prevents re-invocation of inet prerouting
via 'sabotage_in' hook.

Work around this problem by explicit confirmation of the entry at LOCAL_IN
time, before upper layer has a chance to clone the unconfirmed entry.

The downside is that this disables NAT and conntrack helpers.

Alternative fix would be to add locking to all code parts that deal with
unconfirmed packets, but even if that could be done in a sane way this
opens up other problems, for example:

-m physdev --physdev-out eth0 -j SNAT --snat-to 1.2.3.4
-m physdev --physdev-out eth1 -j SNAT --snat-to 1.2.3.5

For multicast case, only one of such conflicting mappings will be
created, conntrack only handles 1:1 NAT mappings.

Users should set create a setup that explicitly marks such traffic
NOTRACK (conntrack bypass) to avoid this, but we cannot auto-bypass
them, ruleset might have accept rules for untracked traffic already,
so user-visible behaviour would change."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

x86/mm: Ensure input to pfn_to_kaddr() is treated as a 64-bit type

On 64-bit platforms, the pfn_to_kaddr() macro requires that the input
value is 64 bits in order to ensure that valid address bits don't get
lost when shifting that input by PAGE_SHIFT to calculate the physical
address to provide a virtual address for.

One such example is in pvalidate_pages() (used by SEV-SNP guests), where
the GFN in the struct used for page-state change requests is a 40-bit
bit-field, so attempts to pass this GFN field directly into
pfn_to_kaddr() ends up causing guest crashes when dealing with addresses
above the 1TB range due to the above.

Fix this issue with SEV-SNP guests, as well as any similar cases that
might cause issues in current/future code, by using an inline function,
instead of a macro, so that the input is implicitly cast to the
expected 64-bit input type prior to performing the shift operation.

While it might be argued that the issue is on the caller side, other
archs/macros have taken similar approaches to deal with instances like
this, such as ARM explicitly casting the input to phys_addr_t:

btrfs: fix deadlock with fiemap and extent locking

While working on the patchset to remove extent locking I got a lockdep
splat with fiemap and pagefaulting with my new extent lock replacement
lock.

This deadlock exists with our normal code, we just don't have lockdep
annotations with the extent locking so we've never noticed it.

Since we're copying the fiemap extent to user space on every iteration
we have the chance of pagefaulting.  Because we hold the extent lock for
the entire range we could mkwrite into a range in the file that we have
mmap'ed.  This would deadlock with the following stack trace

I wrote an fstest to reproduce this deadlock without my replacement lock
and verified that the deadlock exists with our existing locking.

To fix this simply don't take the extent lock for the entire duration of
the fiemap.  This is safe in general because we keep track of where we
are when we're searching the tree, so if an ordered extent updates in
the middle of our fiemap call we'll still emit the correct extents
because we know what offset we were on before.

The only place we maintain the lock is searching delalloc.  Since the
delalloc stuff can change during writeback we want to lock the extent
range so we have a consistent view of delalloc at the time we're
checking to see if we need to set the delalloc flag.

Ben Greear further reports deadlocks during concurrent debugfs
remove while files are being accessed, even though the code in

all the review on the locking, we missed completely that the
logic is wrong: if the refcount hits zero we can finish (and

dm-raid: really frozen sync_thread during suspend

1) commit f52f5c71f3d4 (""md: fix stopping sync thread"") remove
   MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN from __md_stop_writes() and doesn't realize that
   dm-raid relies on __md_stop_writes() to frozen sync_thread
   indirectly. Fix this problem by adding MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN in
   md_stop_writes(), and since stop_sync_thread() is only used for
   dm-raid in this case, also move stop_sync_thread() to
   md_stop_writes().
2) The flag MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN doesn't mean that sync thread is frozen,
   it only prevent new sync_thread to start, and it can't stop the
   running sync thread; In order to frozen sync_thread, after seting the
   flag, stop_sync_thread() should be used.
3) The flag MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN doesn't mean that writes are stopped, use
   it as condition for md_stop_writes() in raid_postsuspend() doesn't
   look correct. Consider that reentrant stop_sync_thread() do nothing,
   always call md_stop_writes() in raid_postsuspend().
4) raid_message can set/clear the flag MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN at anytime,
   and if MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN is cleared while the array is suspended,
   new sync_thread can start unexpected. Fix this by disallow
   raid_message() to change sync_thread status during suspend.

Note that after commit f52f5c71f3d4 (""md: fix stopping sync thread""), the
test shell/lvconvert-raid-reshape.sh start to hang in stop_sync_thread(),
and with previous fixes, the test won't hang there anymore, however, the
test will still fail and complain that ext4 is corrupted. And with this
patch, the test won't hang due to stop_sync_thread() or fail due to ext4
is corrupted anymore. However, there is still a deadlock related to

mm: cachestat: fix two shmem bugs

When cachestat on shmem races with swapping and invalidation, there
are two possible bugs:

1) A swapin error can have resulted in a poisoned swap entry in the
   shmem inode's xarray. Calling get_shadow_from_swap_cache() on it
   will result in an out-of-bounds access to swapper_spaces[].

   Validate the entry with non_swap_entry() before going further.

2) When we find a valid swap entry in the shmem's inode, the shadow
   entry in the swapcache might not exist yet: swap IO is still in
   progress and we're before __remove_mapping; swapin, invalidation,
   or swapoff have removed the shadow from swapcache after we saw the
   shmem swap entry.

   This will send a NULL to workingset_test_recent(). The latter
   purely operates on pointer bits, so it won't crash - node 0, memcg
   ID 0, eviction timestamp 0, etc. are all valid inputs - but it's a
   bogus test. In theory that could result in a false ""recently
   evicted"" count.

btrfs: fix race in read_extent_buffer_pages()

There are reports from tree-checker that detects corrupted nodes,
without any obvious pattern so possibly an overwrite in memory.
After some debugging it turns out there's a race when reading an extent
buffer the uptodate status can be missed.

To prevent concurrent reads for the same extent buffer,
read_extent_buffer_pages() performs these checks:

    /* (1) */
    if (test_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE, &eb->bflags))
        return 0;

    /* (2) */
    if (test_and_set_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_READING, &eb->bflags))
        goto done;

At this point, it seems safe to start the actual read operation. Once
that completes, end_bbio_meta_read() does

    /* (3) */
    set_extent_buffer_uptodate(eb);

    /* (4) */
    clear_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_READING, &eb->bflags);

Normally, this is enough to ensure only one read happens, and all other
callers wait for it to finish before returning.  Unfortunately, there is
a racey interleaving:

    Thread A | Thread B | Thread C
    ---------+----------+---------
       (1)   |          |
             |    (1)   |
       (2)   |          |
       (3)   |          |
       (4)   |          |
             |    (2)   |
             |          |    (1)

When this happens, thread B kicks of an unnecessary read. Worse, thread
C will see UPTODATE set and return immediately, while the read from
thread B is still in progress.  This race could result in tree-checker
errors like this as the extent buffer is concurrently modified:

    BTRFS critical (device dm-0): corrupted node, root=256
    block=8550954455682405139 owner mismatch, have 11858205567642294356
    expect [256, 18446744073709551360]

it's been set, skip the unnecessary read.

x86/efistub: Call mixed mode boot services on the firmware's stack

Normally, the EFI stub calls into the EFI boot services using the stack
that was live when the stub was entered. According to the UEFI spec,
this stack needs to be at least 128k in size - this might seem large but
all asynchronous processing and event handling in EFI runs from the same
stack and so quite a lot of space may be used in practice.

In mixed mode, the situation is a bit different: the bootloader calls
the 32-bit EFI stub entry point, which calls the decompressor's 32-bit
entry point, where the boot stack is set up, using a fixed allocation
of 16k. This stack is still in use when the EFI stub is started in
64-bit mode, and so all calls back into the EFI firmware will be using
the decompressor's limited boot stack.

Due to the placement of the boot stack right after the boot heap, any
stack overruns have gone unnoticed. However, commit

  5c4feadb0011983b (""x86/decompressor: Move global symbol references to C code"")

moved the definition of the boot heap into C code, and now the boot
stack is placed right at the base of BSS, where any overruns will
corrupt the end of the .data section.

While it would be possible to work around this by increasing the size of
the boot stack, doing so would affect all x86 systems, and mixed mode
systems are a tiny (and shrinking) fraction of the x86 installed base.

So instead, record the firmware stack pointer value when entering from
the 32-bit firmware, and switch to this stack every time a EFI boot
service call is made."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

When emulating an atomic access on behalf of the guest, mark the target

fixes a bug where KVM effectively corrupts guest memory during live
migration by writing to guest memory without informing userspace that the

Marking the page dirty got unintentionally dropped when KVM's emulated
CMPXCHG was converted to do a user access.  Before that, KVM explicitly
mapped the guest page into kernel memory, and marked the page dirty during
the unmap phase.

Mark the page dirty even if the CMPXCHG fails, as the old data is written

guaranteed to be the same because the operation is atomic, but KVM's ABI
is that all writes are dirty logged regardless of the value written.  And

ext4: fix corruption during on-line resize

We observed a corruption during on-line resize of a file system that is
larger than 16 TiB with 4k block size. With having more then 2^32 blocks
resize_inode is turned off by default by mke2fs. The issue can be
reproduced on a smaller file system for convenience by explicitly
turning off resize_inode. An on-line resize across an 8 GiB boundary (the
size of a meta block group in this setup) then leads to a corruption:

  dev=/dev/<some_dev> # should be >= 16 GiB
  mkdir -p /corruption
  /sbin/mke2fs -t ext4 -b 4096 -O ^resize_inode $dev $((2 * 2**21 - 2**15))
  mount -t ext4 $dev /corruption

  dd if=/dev/zero bs=4096 of=/corruption/test count=$((2*2**21 - 4*2**15))
  sha1sum /corruption/test
  # 79d2658b39dcfd77274e435b0934028adafaab11  /corruption/test

  /sbin/resize2fs $dev $((2*2**21))
  # drop page cache to force reload the block from disk
  echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

  sha1sum /corruption/test
  # 3c2abc63cbf1a94c9e6977e0fbd72cd832c4d5c3  /corruption/test

2^21 = 2^15*2^6 equals 8 GiB whereof 2^15 is the number of blocks per
block group and 2^6 are the number of block groups that make a meta
block group.

The last checksum might be different depending on how the file is laid
out across the physical blocks. The actual corruption occurs at physical
block 63*2^15 = 2064384 which would be the location of the backup of the
meta block group's block descriptor. During the on-line resize the file
system will be converted to meta_bg starting at s_first_meta_bg which is
2 in the example - meaning all block groups after 16 GiB. However, in
ext4_flex_group_add we might add block groups that are not part of the
first meta block group yet. In the reproducer we achieved this by
substracting the size of a whole block group from the point where the
meta block group would start. This must be considered when updating the
backup block group descriptors to follow the non-meta_bg layout. The fix
is to add a test whether the group to add is already part of the meta
block group or not."

PCI/PM: Drain runtime-idle callbacks before driver removal

A race condition between the .runtime_idle() callback and the .remove()
callback in the rtsx_pcr PCI driver leads to a kernel crash due to an
unhandled page fault [1].

The problem is that rtsx_pci_runtime_idle() is not expected to be running
after pm_runtime_get_sync() has been called, but the latter doesn't really
guarantee that.  It only guarantees that the suspend and resume callbacks
will not be running when it returns.

However, if a .runtime_idle() callback is already running when
pm_runtime_get_sync() is called, the latter will notice that the runtime PM
status of the device is RPM_ACTIVE and it will return right away without
waiting for the former to complete.  In fact, it cannot wait for
.runtime_idle() to complete because it may be called from that callback (it
arguably does not make much sense to do that, but it is not strictly
prohibited).

Thus in general, whoever is providing a .runtime_idle() callback needs
to protect it from running in parallel with whatever code runs after
pm_runtime_get_sync().  [Note that .runtime_idle() will not start after
pm_runtime_get_sync() has returned, but it may continue running then if it
has started earlier.]

One way to address that race condition is to call pm_runtime_barrier()
after pm_runtime_get_sync() (not before it, because a nonzero value of the
runtime PM usage counter is necessary to prevent runtime PM callbacks from
being invoked) to wait for the .runtime_idle() callback to complete should
it be running at that point.  A suitable place for doing that is in
pci_device_remove() which calls pm_runtime_get_sync() before removing the
driver, so it may as well call pm_runtime_barrier() subsequently, which
will prevent the race in question from occurring, not just in the rtsx_pcr
driver, but in any PCI drivers providing .runtime_idle() callbacks."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

swiotlb: Fix double-allocation of slots due to broken alignment handling

Commit bbb73a103fbb (""swiotlb: fix a braino in the alignment check fix""),
which was a fix for commit 0eee5ae10256 (""swiotlb: fix slot alignment
checks""), causes a functional regression with vsock in a virtual machine
using bouncing via a restricted DMA SWIOTLB pool.

When virtio allocates the virtqueues for the vsock device using
dma_alloc_coherent(), the SWIOTLB search can return page-unaligned
allocations if 'area->index' was left unaligned by a previous allocation
from the buffer:

 # Final address in brackets is the SWIOTLB address returned to the caller
 | virtio-pci 0000:00:07.0: orig_addr 0x0 alloc_size 0x2000, iotlb_align_mask 0x800 stride 0x2: got slot 1645-1649/7168 (0x98326800)

This ends badly (typically buffer corruption and/or a hang) because
swiotlb_alloc() is expecting a page-aligned allocation and so blindly
returns a pointer to the 'struct page' corresponding to the allocation,
therefore double-allocating the first half (2KiB slot) of the 4KiB page.

Fix the problem by treating the allocation alignment separately to any
additional alignment requirements from the device, using the maximum
of the two as the stride to search the buffer slots and taking care
to ensure a minimum of page-alignment for buffers larger than a page.

This also resolves swiotlb allocation failures occuring due to the
inclusion of ~PAGE_MASK in 'iotlb_align_mask' for large allocations and
resulting in alignment requirements exceeding swiotlb_max_mapping_size()."	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

LoongArch: Define the __io_aw() hook as mmiowb()

Commit fb24ea52f78e0d595852e (""drivers: Remove explicit invocations of
mmiowb()"") remove all mmiowb() in drivers, but it says:

""NOTE: mmiowb() has only ever guaranteed ordering in conjunction with
spin_unlock(). However, pairing each mmiowb() removal in this patch with
the corresponding call to spin_unlock() is not at all trivial, so there
is a small chance that this change may regress any drivers incorrectly
relying on mmiowb() to order MMIO writes between CPUs using lock-free
synchronisation.""

The mmio in radeon_ring_commit() is protected by a mutex rather than a
spinlock, but in the mutex fastpath it behaves similar to spinlock. We
can add mmiowb() calls in the radeon driver but the maintainer says he
doesn't like such a workaround, and radeon is not the only example of
mutex protected mmio.

So we should extend the mmiowb tracking system from spinlock to mutex,
and maybe other locking primitives. This is not easy and error prone, so
we solve it in the architectural code, by simply defining the __io_aw()
hook as mmiowb(). And we no longer need to override queued_spin_unlock()
so use the generic definition.

Without this, we get such an error when run 'glxgears' on weak ordering
architectures such as LoongArch:

misc: lis3lv02d_i2c: Fix regulators getting en-/dis-abled twice on suspend/resume

When not configured for wakeup lis3lv02d_i2c_suspend() will call
lis3lv02d_poweroff() even if the device has already been turned off
by the runtime-suspend handler and if configured for wakeup and
the device is runtime-suspended at this point then it is not turned
back on to serve as a wakeup source.

Before commit b1b9f7a49440 (""misc: lis3lv02d_i2c: Add missing setting
of the reg_ctrl callback""), lis3lv02d_poweroff() failed to disable
the regulators which as a side effect made calling poweroff() twice ok.

lis3lv02d_i2c_resume() has similar issues, with an added weirness that
it always powers on the device if it is runtime suspended, after which
the first runtime-resume will call poweron() again, causing the enabled
count for the regulator to increase by 1 every suspend/resume. These
unbalanced regulator_enable() calls cause the regulator to never

usb: gadget: ncm: Fix handling of zero block length packets

While connecting to a Linux host with CDC_NCM_NTB_DEF_SIZE_TX
set to 65536, it has been observed that we receive short packets,
which come at interval of 5-10 seconds sometimes and have block
length zero but still contain 1-2 valid datagrams present.

According to the NCM spec:

""If wBlockLength = 0x0000, the block is terminated by a
short packet. In this case, the USB transfer must still
be shorter than dwNtbInMaxSize or dwNtbOutMaxSize. If
exactly dwNtbInMaxSize or dwNtbOutMaxSize bytes are sent,
and the size is a multiple of wMaxPacketSize for the
given pipe, then no ZLP shall be sent.

wBlockLength= 0x0000 must be used with extreme care, because
of the possibility that the host and device may get out of
sync, and because of test issues.

wBlockLength = 0x0000 allows the sender to reduce latency by
starting to send a very large NTB, and then shortening it when
the sender discovers that there’s not sufficient data to justify
sending a large NTB""

However, there is a potential issue with the current implementation,
as it checks for the occurrence of multiple NTBs in a single
giveback by verifying if the leftover bytes to be processed is zero
or not. If the block length reads zero, we would process the same
NTB infintely because the leftover bytes is never zero and it leads
to a crash. Fix this by bailing out if block length reads zero."

bpf: Guard stack limits against 32bit overflow

This patch promotes the arithmetic around checking stack bounds to be
done in the 64-bit domain, instead of the current 32bit. The arithmetic
implies adding together a 64-bit register with a int offset. The
register was checked to be below 1<<29 when it was variable, but not
when it was fixed. The offset either comes from an instruction (in which
case it is 16 bit), from another register (in which case the caller
checked it to be below 1<<29 [1]), or from the size of an argument to a
kfunc (in which case it can be a u32 [2]). Between the register being
inconsistently checked to be below 1<<29, and the offset being up to an
u32, it appears that we were open to overflowing the `int`s which were
currently used for arithmetic.

netfilter: bridge: replace physindev with physinif in nf_bridge_info

An skb can be added to a neigh->arp_queue while waiting for an arp

another, the skb would be added to a neigh->arp_queue of the bridge.

there is no explicit mechanism that prevents this physindev from been
freed under us (for instance neigh_flush_dev doesn't cleanup skbs from
different device's neigh queue) we can crash on e.g. this stack:

setup and then because we forget to set 'full record' indicating we
can no longer consume data without a send we fallthrough to the 'continue'
path which will check if msg_data_left(msg) has more bytes to send and
then attempts to fit them in the already full msg_pl. Then next
iteration of sender doing send will encounter a full msg_pl and throw
the warning in the syzbot report.

To fix simply check if we have a full_record in splice code path and
if not send the msg regardless of MORE flag."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

iommu/vt-d: Use device rbtree in iopf reporting path

The existing I/O page fault handler currently locates the PCI device by
calling pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot(). This function searches the list
of all PCI devices until the desired device is found. To improve lookup
efficiency, replace it with device_rbtree_find() to search the device
within the probed device rbtree.

The I/O page fault is initiated by the device, which does not have any
synchronization mechanism with the software to ensure that the device
stays in the probed device tree. Theoretically, a device could be released
by the IOMMU subsystem after device_rbtree_find() and before
iopf_get_dev_fault_param(), which would cause a use-after-free problem.

Add a mutex to synchronize the I/O page fault reporting path and the IOMMU
release device path. This lock doesn't introduce any performance overhead,

Christian reports a NULL deref in zswap that he bisected down to the zswap
shrinker.  The issue also cropped up in the bug trackers of libguestfs [1]
and the Red Hat bugzilla [2].

The problem is that when memcg is disabled with the boot time flag, the
zswap shrinker might get called with sc->memcg == NULL.  This is okay in
many places, like the lruvec operations.  But it crashes in
memcg_page_state() - which is only used due to the non-node accounting of
cgroup's the zswap memory to begin with.

Nhat spotted that the memcg can be NULL in the memcg-disabled case, and I
was then able to reproduce the crash locally as well.

mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix memory leak when canceling rehash work

The rehash delayed work is rescheduled with a delay if the number of
credits at end of the work is not negative as supposedly it means that
the migration ended. Otherwise, it is rescheduled immediately.

After ""mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix possible use-after-free during
rehash"" the above is no longer accurate as a non-negative number of
credits is no longer indicative of the migration being done. It can also
happen if the work encountered an error in which case the migration will
resume the next time the work is scheduled.

The significance of the above is that it is possible for the work to be
pending and associated with hints that were allocated when the migration
started. This leads to the hints being leaked [1] when the work is
canceled while pending as part of ACL region dismantle.

Fix by freeing the hints if hints are associated with a work that was
canceled while pending.

Blame the original commit since the reliance on not having a pending
work associated with hints is fragile.

mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix memory leak during rehash

The rehash delayed work migrates filters from one region to another.
This is done by iterating over all chunks (all the filters with the same
priority) in the region and in each chunk iterating over all the
filters.

If the migration fails, the code tries to migrate the filters back to
the old region. However, the rollback itself can also fail in which case
another migration will be erroneously performed. Besides the fact that
this ping pong is not a very good idea, it also creates a problem.

Each virtual chunk references two chunks: The currently used one
('vchunk->chunk') and a backup ('vchunk->chunk2'). During migration the
first holds the chunk we want to migrate filters to and the second holds
the chunk we are migrating filters from.

The code currently assumes - but does not verify - that the backup chunk
does not exist (NULL) if the currently used chunk does not reference the
target region. This assumption breaks when we are trying to rollback a
rollback, resulting in the backup chunk being overwritten and leaked
[1].

Fix by not rolling back a failed rollback and add a warning to avoid
future cases.

CVE-2024-35860	2024-05-19T09:15:07.603	2025-09-26T16:03:27.003	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: support deferring bpf_link dealloc to after RCU grace period

BPF link for some program types is passed as a ""context"" which can be
used by those BPF programs to look up additional information. E.g., for
multi-kprobes and multi-uprobes, link is used to fetch BPF cookie values.

Because of this runtime dependency, when bpf_link refcnt drops to zero
there could still be active BPF programs running accessing link data.

This patch adds generic support to defer bpf_link dealloc callback to
after RCU GP, if requested. This is done by exposing two different
deallocation callbacks, one synchronous and one deferred. If deferred
one is provided, bpf_link_free() will schedule dealloc_deferred()
callback to happen after RCU GP.

BPF is using two flavors of RCU: ""classic"" non-sleepable one and RCU
tasks trace one. The latter is used when sleepable BPF programs are
used. bpf_link_free() accommodates that by checking underlying BPF
program's sleepable flag, and goes either through normal RCU GP only for
non-sleepable, or through RCU tasks trace GP *and* then normal RCU GP
(taking into account rcu_trace_implies_rcu_gp() optimization), if BPF
program is sleepable.

We use this for multi-kprobe and multi-uprobe links, which dereference
link during program run. We also preventively switch raw_tp link to use
deferred dealloc callback, as upcoming changes in bpf-next tree expose
raw_tp link data (specifically, cookie value) to BPF program at runtime
as well."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

smb: client: fix UAF in smb2_reconnect_server()

The UAF bug is due to smb2_reconnect_server() accessing a session that
is already being teared down by another thread that is executing
__cifs_put_smb_ses().  This can happen when (a) the client has
connection to the server but no session or (b) another thread ends up
setting @ses->ses_status again to something different than
SES_EXITING.

To fix this, we need to make sure to unconditionally set
@ses->ses_status to SES_EXITING and prevent any other threads from
setting a new status while we're still tearing it down.

The following can be reproduced by adding some delay to right after
the ipc is freed in __cifs_put_smb_ses() - which will give
smb2_reconnect_server() worker a chance to run and then accessing
@ses->ipc:

CVE-2024-35871	2024-05-19T09:15:08.507	2024-11-21T09:21:05.780	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv: process: Fix kernel gp leakage

childregs represents the registers which are active for the new thread
in user context. For a kernel thread, childregs->gp is never used since
the kernel gp is not touched by switch_to. For a user mode helper, the
gp value can be observed in user space after execve or possibly by other
means.

[From the email thread]

The /* Kernel thread */ comment is somewhat inaccurate in that it is also used
for user_mode_helper threads, which exec a user process, e.g. /sbin/init or
when /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern is a pipe. Such threads do not have
PF_KTHREAD set and are valid targets for ptrace etc. even before they exec.

childregs is the *user* context during syscall execution and it is observable
from userspace in at least five ways:

1. kernel_execve does not currently clear integer registers, so the starting
   register state for PID 1 and other user processes started by the kernel has
   sp = user stack, gp = kernel __global_pointer$, all other integer registers
   zeroed by the memset in the patch comment.

   This is a bug in its own right, but I'm unwilling to bet that it is the only
   way to exploit the issue addressed by this patch.

2. ptrace(PTRACE_GETREGSET): you can PTRACE_ATTACH to a user_mode_helper thread
   before it execs, but ptrace requires SIGSTOP to be delivered which can only
   happen at user/kernel boundaries.

3. /proc/*/task/*/syscall: this is perfectly happy to read pt_regs for
   user_mode_helpers before the exec completes, but gp is not one of the
   registers it returns.

4. PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_USER: LOCKDOWN_PERF normally prevents access to kernel
   addresses via PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_INTR, but due to this bug kernel addresses
   are also exposed via PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_USER which is permitted under
   LOCKDOWN_PERF. I have not attempted to write exploit code.

5. Much of the tracing infrastructure allows access to user registers. I have
   not attempted to determine which forms of tracing allow access to user
   registers without already allowing access to kernel registers."

mm/secretmem: fix GUP-fast succeeding on secretmem folios

folio_is_secretmem() currently relies on secretmem folios being LRU
folios, to save some cycles.

However, folios might reside in a folio batch without the LRU flag set, or
temporarily have their LRU flag cleared.  Consequently, the LRU flag is
unreliable for this purpose.

In particular, this is the case when secretmem_fault() allocates a fresh
page and calls filemap_add_folio()->folio_add_lru().  The folio might be
added to the per-cpu folio batch and won't get the LRU flag set until the
batch was drained using e.g., lru_add_drain().

Consequently, folio_is_secretmem() might not detect secretmem folios and
GUP-fast can succeed in grabbing a secretmem folio, crashing the kernel
when we would later try reading/writing to the folio, because the folio
has been unmapped from the directmap.

Fix it by removing that unreliable check."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

riscv: Fix vector state restore in rt_sigreturn()

The RISC-V Vector specification states in ""Appendix D: Calling
Convention for Vector State"" [1] that ""Executing a system call causes
all caller-saved vector registers (v0-v31, vl, vtype) and vstart to
become unspecified."". In the RISC-V kernel this is called ""discarding
the vstate"".

Returning from a signal handler via the rt_sigreturn() syscall, vector
discard is also performed. However, this is not an issue since the
vector state should be restored from the sigcontext, and therefore not
care about the vector discard.

The ""live state"" is the actual vector register in the running context,
and the ""vstate"" is the vector state of the task. A dirty live state,
means that the vstate and live state are not in synch.

When vectorized user_from_copy() was introduced, an bug sneaked in at
the restoration code, related to the discard of the live state.

An example when this go wrong:

  1. A userland application is executing vector code
  2. The application receives a signal, and the signal handler is
     entered.
  3. The application returns from the signal handler, using the
     rt_sigreturn() syscall.
  4. The live vector state is discarded upon entering the
     rt_sigreturn(), and the live state is marked as ""dirty"", indicating
     that the live state need to be synchronized with the current
     vstate.
  5. rt_sigreturn() restores the vstate, except the Vector registers,
     from the sigcontext
  6. rt_sigreturn() restores the Vector registers, from the sigcontext,
     and now the vectorized user_from_copy() is used. The dirty live
     state from the discard is saved to the vstate, making the vstate
     corrupt.
  7. rt_sigreturn() returns to the application, which crashes due to
     corrupted vstate.

Note that the vectorized user_from_copy() is invoked depending on the
value of CONFIG_RISCV_ISA_V_UCOPY_THRESHOLD. Default is 768, which
means that vlen has to be larger than 128b for this bug to trigger.

The fix is simply to mark the live state as non-dirty/clean prior
performing the vstate restore."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

x86/coco: Require seeding RNG with RDRAND on CoCo systems

There are few uses of CoCo that don't rely on working cryptography and
hence a working RNG. Unfortunately, the CoCo threat model means that the
VM host cannot be trusted and may actively work against guests to
extract secrets or manipulate computation. Since a malicious host can
modify or observe nearly all inputs to guests, the only remaining source
of entropy for CoCo guests is RDRAND.

If RDRAND is broken -- due to CPU hardware fault -- the RNG as a whole
is meant to gracefully continue on gathering entropy from other sources,
but since there aren't other sources on CoCo, this is catastrophic.
This is mostly a concern at boot time when initially seeding the RNG, as
after that the consequences of a broken RDRAND are much more
theoretical.

So, try at boot to seed the RNG using 256 bits of RDRAND output. If this
fails, panic(). This will also trigger if the system is booted without
RDRAND, as RDRAND is essential for a safe CoCo boot.

Add this deliberately to be ""just a CoCo x86 driver feature"" and not
part of the RNG itself. Many device drivers and platforms have some
desire to contribute something to the RNG, and add_device_randomness()
is specifically meant for this purpose.

Any driver can call it with seed data of any quality, or even garbage
quality, and it can only possibly make the quality of the RNG better or
have no effect, but can never make it worse.

Rather than trying to build something into the core of the RNG, consider
the particular CoCo issue just a CoCo issue, and therefore separate it
all out into driver (well, arch/platform) code.

x86/mm/pat: fix VM_PAT handling in COW mappings

PAT handling won't do the right thing in COW mappings: the first PTE (or,
in fact, all PTEs) can be replaced during write faults to point at anon
folios.  Reliably recovering the correct PFN and cachemode using
follow_phys() from PTEs will not work in COW mappings.

Using follow_phys(), we might just get the address+protection of the anon
folio (which is very wrong), or fail on swap/nonswap entries, failing
follow_phys() and triggering a WARN_ON_ONCE() in untrack_pfn() and
track_pfn_copy(), not properly calling free_pfn_range().

In free_pfn_range(), we either wouldn't call memtype_free() or would call
it with the wrong range, possibly leaking memory.

To fix that, let's update follow_phys() to refuse returning anon folios,
and fallback to using the stored PFN inside vma->vm_pgoff for COW mappings
if we run into that.

We will now properly handle untrack_pfn() with COW mappings, where we
don't need the cachemode.  We'll have to fail fork()->track_pfn_copy() if
the first page was replaced by an anon folio, though: we'd have to store
the cachemode in the VMA to make this work, likely growing the VMA size.

For now, lets keep it simple and let track_pfn_copy() just fail in that
case: it would have failed in the past with swap/nonswap entries already,
and it would have done the wrong thing with anon folios.

udp: do not accept non-tunnel GSO skbs landing in a tunnel

When rx-udp-gro-forwarding is enabled UDP packets might be GROed when
being forwarded. If such packets might land in a tunnel this can cause
various issues and udp_gro_receive makes sure this isn't the case by
looking for a matching socket. This is performed in
udp4/6_gro_lookup_skb but only in the current netns. This is an issue
with tunneled packets when the endpoint is in another netns. In such
cases the packets will be GROed at the UDP level, which leads to various
issues later on. The same thing can happen with rx-gro-list.

We saw this with geneve packets being GROed at the UDP level. In such
case gso_size is set; later the packet goes through the geneve rx path,
the geneve header is pulled, the offset are adjusted and frag_list skbs
are not adjusted with regard to geneve. When those skbs hit
skb_fragment, it will misbehave. Different outcomes are possible
depending on what the GROed skbs look like; from corrupted packets to
kernel crashes.

One example is a BUG_ON[1] triggered in skb_segment while processing the
frag_list. Because gso_size is wrong (geneve header was pulled)
skb_segment thinks there is ""geneve header size"" of data in frag_list,
although it's in fact the next packet. The BUG_ON itself has nothing to
do with the issue. This is only one of the potential issues.

Looking up for a matching socket in udp_gro_receive is fragile: the
lookup could be extended to all netns (not speaking about performances)
but nothing prevents those packets from being modified in between and we
could still not find a matching socket. It's OK to keep the current
logic there as it should cover most cases but we also need to make sure
we handle tunnel packets being GROed too early.

This is done by extending the checks in udp_unexpected_gso: GSO packets
lacking the SKB_GSO_UDP_TUNNEL/_CSUM bits and landing in a tunnel must
be segmented.

During system shutdown, the mlxbf_gige driver's shutdown() is always executed.
However, the driver's stop() method will only execute if networking interface
configuration logic within the Linux distribution has been setup to do so.

If shutdown() executes but stop() does not execute, NAPI remains enabled
and this can lead to an exception if NAPI is scheduled while the hardware
interface has only been partially deinitialized.

The networking interface managed by the mlxbf_gige driver must be properly
stopped during system shutdown so that IFF_UP is cleared, the hardware
interface is put into a clean state, and NAPI is fully deinitialized."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2024-35886	2024-05-19T09:15:09.757	2024-11-21T09:21:07.707	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: Fix infinite recursion in fib6_dump_done().

syzkaller reported infinite recursive calls of fib6_dump_done() during
netlink socket destruction.  [1]

From the log, syzkaller sent an AF_UNSPEC RTM_GETROUTE message, and then
the response was generated.  The following recvmmsg() resumed the dump
for IPv6, but the first call of inet6_dump_fib() failed at kzalloc() due
to the fault injection.  [0]

  12:01:34 executing program 3:
  r0 = socket$nl_route(0x10, 0x3, 0x0)
  sendmsg$nl_route(r0, ... snip ...)
  recvmmsg(r0, ... snip ...) (fail_nth: 8)

Here, fib6_dump_done() was set to nlk_sk(sk)->cb.done, and the next call
of inet6_dump_fib() set it to nlk_sk(sk)->cb.args[3].  syzkaller stopped
receiving the response halfway through, and finally netlink_sock_destruct()
called nlk_sk(sk)->cb.done().

fib6_dump_done() calls fib6_dump_end() and nlk_sk(sk)->cb.done() if it
is still not NULL.  fib6_dump_end() rewrites nlk_sk(sk)->cb.done() by
nlk_sk(sk)->cb.args[3], but it has the same function, not NULL, calling
itself recursively and hitting the stack guard page.

To avoid the issue, let's set the destructor after kzalloc().

ax25: fix use-after-free bugs caused by ax25_ds_del_timer

When the ax25 device is detaching, the ax25_dev_device_down()

the timer handler is running, the ax25_ds_del_timer() that
calls del_timer() in it will return directly. As a result,
the use-after-free bugs could happen, one of the scenarios
is shown below:

The issue here is that 'struct tc_skbmod' has a four bytes hole.

We need to clear the structure before filling fields.

CVE-2024-35895	2024-05-19T09:15:10.477	2024-12-30T17:12:29.817	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf, sockmap: Prevent lock inversion deadlock in map delete elem

syzkaller started using corpuses where a BPF tracing program deletes
elements from a sockmap/sockhash map. Because BPF tracing programs can be
invoked from any interrupt context, locks taken during a map_delete_elem
operation must be hardirq-safe. Otherwise a deadlock due to lock inversion
is possible, as reported by lockdep:

       CPU0                    CPU1
       ----                    ----
  lock(&htab->buckets[i].lock);
                               local_irq_disable();
                               lock(&host->lock);
                               lock(&htab->buckets[i].lock);
  <Interrupt>
    lock(&host->lock);

Locks in sockmap are hardirq-unsafe by design. We expects elements to be
deleted from sockmap/sockhash only in task (normal) context with interrupts
enabled, or in softirq context.

Detect when map_delete_elem operation is invoked from a context which is
_not_ hardirq-unsafe, that is interrupts are disabled, and bail out with an
error.

Note that map updates are not affected by this issue. BPF verifier does not
allow updating sockmap/sockhash from a BPF tracing program today."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

netfilter: nf_tables: reject new basechain after table flag update

When dormant flag is toggled, hooks are disabled in the commit phase by
iterating over current chains in table (existing and new).

The following configuration allows for an inconsistent state:

  add table x
  add chain x y { type filter hook input priority 0; }
  add table x { flags dormant; }
  add chain x w { type filter hook input priority 1; }

which triggers the following warning when trying to unregister chain w
which is already unregistered.

net/rds: fix possible cp null dereference

cp might be null, calling cp->cp_conn would produce null dereference

[Simon Horman adds:]

Analysis:

* cp is a parameter of __rds_rdma_map and is not reassigned.

* The following call-sites pass a NULL cp argument to __rds_rdma_map()

  - rds_get_mr()
  - rds_get_mr_for_dest

* Prior to the code above, the following assumes that cp may be NULL
  (which is indicative, but could itself be unnecessary)

	trans_private = rs->rs_transport->get_mr(
		sg, nents, rs, &mr->r_key, cp ? cp->cp_conn : NULL,
		args->vec.addr, args->vec.bytes,
		need_odp ? ODP_ZEROBASED : ODP_NOT_NEEDED);

* The code modified by this patch is guarded by IS_ERR(trans_private),
  where trans_private is assigned as per the previous point in this analysis.

  The only implementation of get_mr that I could locate is rds_ib_get_mr()
  which can return an ERR_PTR if the conn (4th) argument is NULL.

* ret is set to PTR_ERR(trans_private).
  rds_ib_get_mr can return ERR_PTR(-ENODEV) if the conn (4th) argument is NULL.
  Thus ret may be -ENODEV in which case the code in question will execute.

Conclusion:
* cp may be NULL at the point where this patch adds a check;
  this patch does seem to address a possible bug"	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-35910	2024-05-19T09:15:11.617	2024-11-21T09:21:10.933	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: properly terminate timers for kernel sockets

We had various syzbot reports about tcp timers firing after
the corresponding netns has been dismantled.

Fortunately Josef Bacik could trigger the issue more often,
and could test a patch I wrote two years ago.

When TCP sockets are closed, we call inet_csk_clear_xmit_timers()
to 'stop' the timers.

inet_csk_clear_xmit_timers() can be called from any context,
including when socket lock is held.
This is the reason it uses sk_stop_timer(), aka del_timer().
This means that ongoing timers might finish much later.

For user sockets, this is fine because each running timer
holds a reference on the socket, and the user socket holds
a reference on the netns.

For kernel sockets, we risk that the netns is freed before
timer can complete, because kernel sockets do not hold
reference on the netns.

This patch adds inet_csk_clear_xmit_timers_sync() function
that using sk_stop_timer_sync() to make sure all timers
are terminated before the kernel socket is released.
Modules using kernel sockets close them in their netns exit()
handler.

Also add sock_not_owned_by_me() helper to get LOCKDEP
support : inet_csk_clear_xmit_timers_sync() must not be called
while socket lock is held.

It is very possible we can revert in the future commit
3a58f13a881e (""net: rds: acquire refcount on TCP sockets"")
which attempted to solve the issue in rds only.
(net/smc/af_smc.c and net/mptcp/subflow.c have similar code)

We probably can remove the check_net() tests from
tcp_out_of_resources() and __tcp_close() in the future."	5.8	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H

ice: fix memory corruption bug with suspend and rebuild

The ice driver would previously panic after suspend. This is caused
from the driver *only* calling the ice_vsi_free_q_vectors() function by
itself, when it is suspending. Since commit b3e7b3a6ee92 (""ice: prevent
NULL pointer deref during reload"") the driver has zeroed out
num_q_vectors, and only restored it in ice_vsi_cfg_def().

This further causes the ice_rebuild() function to allocate a zero length
buffer, after which num_q_vectors is updated, and then the new value of
num_q_vectors is used to index into the zero length buffer, which
corrupts memory.

The fix entails making sure all the code referencing num_q_vectors only
does so after it has been reset via ice_vsi_cfg_def().

I didn't perform a full bisect, but I was able to test against 6.1.77
kernel and that ice driver works fine for suspend/resume with no panic,
so sometime since then, this problem was introduced.

Also clean up an un-needed init of a local variable in the function
being modified.

This is caused by GCC moving memcpy() after assignments in
bpf_jit_plt(), resulting in NULL pointers being written instead of
the return and the target addresses.

Looking at the GCC internals, the reordering is allowed because the
alias analysis thinks that the memcpy() destination and the assignments'
left-hand-sides are based on different objects: new_plt and
bpf_plt_ret/bpf_plt_target respectively, and therefore they cannot
alias.

This is in turn due to a violation of the C standard:

  When two pointers are subtracted, both shall point to elements of the
  same array object, or one past the last element of the array object
  ...

From the C's perspective, bpf_plt_ret and bpf_plt are distinct objects
and cannot be subtracted. In the practical terms, doing so confuses the
GCC's alias analysis.

The code was written this way in order to let the C side know a few
offsets defined in the assembly. While nice, this is by no means
necessary. Fix the noncompliance by hardcoding these offsets.

media: mediatek: vcodec: Fix oops when HEVC init fails

The stateless HEVC decoder saves the instance pointer in the context
regardless if the initialization worked or not. This caused a use after
free, when the pointer is freed in case of a failure in the deinit
function.
Only store the instance pointer when the initialization was successful,
to solve this issue.

This happens because, although `prepare_fb` and `cleanup_fb` are
perfectly balanced, we cannot guarantee consistency in the check
plane->state->fb == state->fb. This means that sometimes we can increase
the refcount in `prepare_fb` and don't decrease it in `cleanup_fb`. The
opposite can also be true.

In fact, the struct drm_plane .state shouldn't be accessed directly
but instead, the `drm_atomic_get_new_plane_state()` helper function should
be used. So, we could stick to this check, but using
`drm_atomic_get_new_plane_state()`. But actually, this check is not re

net/smc: reduce rtnl pressure in smc_pnet_create_pnetids_list()

Many syzbot reports show extreme rtnl pressure, and many of them hint
that smc acquires rtnl in netns creation for no good reason [1]

This patch returns early from smc_pnet_net_init()
if there is no netdevice yet.

I am not even sure why smc_pnet_create_pnetids_list() even exists,
because smc_pnet_netdev_event() is also calling
smc_pnet_add_base_pnetid() when handling NETDEV_UP event.

Actually those buffers are used only by QMI target -> host communication.
And for WCN6855 and QCA6390, the largest packet size for that is less
than 6KB. So change buf_len field to 8KB, which results in order 1
allocation if page size is 4KB. In this way, we can at least save some
memory, and as well as decrease the possibility of allocation failure
in those scenarios.

On TDX it is possible for the untrusted host to cause
set_memory_encrypted() or set_memory_decrypted() to fail such that an
error is returned and the resulting memory is shared. Callers need to
take care to handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared)
memory to the page allocator, which could lead to functional or security
issues.

DMA could free decrypted/shared pages if dma_set_decrypted() fails. This
should be a rare case. Just leak the pages in this case instead of
freeing them."	7.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H

VMCI: Fix memcpy() run-time warning in dg_dispatch_as_host()

Syzkaller hit 'WARNING in dg_dispatch_as_host' bug.

memcpy: detected field-spanning write (size 56) of single field ""&dg_info->msg""
at drivers/misc/vmw_vmci/vmci_datagram.c:237 (size 24)

WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1555 at drivers/misc/vmw_vmci/vmci_datagram.c:237
dg_dispatch_as_host+0x88e/0xa60 drivers/misc/vmw_vmci/vmci_datagram.c:237

Some code commentry, based on my understanding:

544 #define VMCI_DG_SIZE(_dg) (VMCI_DG_HEADERSIZE + (size_t)(_dg)->payload_size)
/// This is 24 + payload_size

memcpy(&dg_info->msg, dg, dg_size);
	Destination = dg_info->msg ---> this is a 24 byte
					structure(struct vmci_datagram)
	Source = dg --> this is a 24 byte structure (struct vmci_datagram)
	Size = dg_size = 24 + payload_size

{payload_size = 56-24 =32} -- Syzkaller managed to set payload_size to 32.

 35 struct delayed_datagram_info {
 36         struct datagram_entry *entry;
 37         struct work_struct work;
 38         bool in_dg_host_queue;
 39         /* msg and msg_payload must be together. */
 40         struct vmci_datagram msg;
 41         u8 msg_payload[];
 42 };

So those extra bytes of payload are copied into msg_payload[], a run time
warning is seen while fuzzing with Syzkaller.

One possible way to fix the warning is to split the memcpy() into
two parts -- one -- direct assignment of msg and second taking care of payload.

CVE-2024-1968	2024-05-20T08:15:08.850	2025-07-15T16:01:53.633	In scrapy/scrapy, an issue was identified where the Authorization header is not removed during redirects that only change the scheme (e.g., HTTPS to HTTP) but remain within the same domain. This behavior contravenes the Fetch standard, which mandates the removal of Authorization headers in cross-origin requests when the scheme, host, or port changes. Consequently, when a redirect downgrades from HTTPS to HTTP, the Authorization header may be inadvertently exposed in plaintext, leading to potential sensitive information disclosure to unauthorized actors. The flaw is located in the _build_redirect_request function of the redirect middleware.

btrfs: make sure that WRITTEN is set on all metadata blocks

We previously would call btrfs_check_leaf() if we had the check
integrity code enabled, which meant that we could only run the extended
leaf checks if we had WRITTEN set on the header flags.

This leaves a gap in our checking, because we could end up with
corruption on disk where WRITTEN isn't set on the leaf, and then the
extended leaf checks don't get run which we rely on to validate all of
the item pointers to make sure we don't access memory outside of the
extent buffer.

However, since 732fab95abe2 (""btrfs: check-integrity: remove
CONFIG_BTRFS_FS_CHECK_INTEGRITY option"") we no longer call
btrfs_check_leaf() from btrfs_mark_buffer_dirty(), which means we only
ever call it on blocks that are being written out, and thus have WRITTEN
set, or that are being read in, which should have WRITTEN set.

Add checks to make sure we have WRITTEN set appropriately, and then make
sure __btrfs_check_leaf() always does the item checking.  This will
protect us from file systems that have been corrupted and no longer have
WRITTEN set on some of the blocks.

This was hit on a crafted image tweaking the WRITTEN bit and reported by
KASAN as out-of-bound access in the eb accessors. The example is a dir
item at the end of an eb.

kprobes: Fix possible use-after-free issue on kprobe registration

When unloading a module, its state is changing MODULE_STATE_LIVE ->
 MODULE_STATE_GOING -> MODULE_STATE_UNFORMED. Each change will take
a time. `is_module_text_address()` and `__module_text_address()`
works with MODULE_STATE_LIVE and MODULE_STATE_GOING.
If we use `is_module_text_address()` and `__module_text_address()`
separately, there is a chance that the first one is succeeded but the
next one is failed because module->state becomes MODULE_STATE_UNFORMED
between those operations.

In `check_kprobe_address_safe()`, if the second `__module_text_address()`
is failed, that is ignored because it expected a kernel_text address.
But it may have failed simply because module->state has been changed
to MODULE_STATE_UNFORMED. In this case, arm_kprobe() will try to modify
non-exist module text address (use-after-free).

To fix this problem, we should not use separated `is_module_text_address()`
and `__module_text_address()`, but use only `__module_text_address()`
once and do `try_module_get(module)` which is only available with
MODULE_STATE_LIVE."	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

btrfs: qgroup: fix qgroup prealloc rsv leak in subvolume operations

Create subvolume, create snapshot and delete subvolume all use
btrfs_subvolume_reserve_metadata() to reserve metadata for the changes
done to the parent subvolume's fs tree, which cannot be mediated in the
normal way via start_transaction. When quota groups (squota or qgroups)
are enabled, this reserves qgroup metadata of type PREALLOC. Once the
operation is associated to a transaction, we convert PREALLOC to
PERTRANS, which gets cleared in bulk at the end of the transaction.

However, the error paths of these three operations were not implementing
this lifecycle correctly. They unconditionally converted the PREALLOC to
PERTRANS in a generic cleanup step regardless of errors or whether the
operation was fully associated to a transaction or not. This resulted in
error paths occasionally converting this rsv to PERTRANS without calling
record_root_in_trans successfully, which meant that unless that root got
recorded in the transaction by some other thread, the end of the
transaction would not free that root's PERTRANS, leaking it. Ultimately,
this resulted in hitting a WARN in CONFIG_BTRFS_DEBUG builds at unmount
for the leaked reservation.

The fix is to ensure that every qgroup PREALLOC reservation observes the
following properties:

1. any failure before record_root_in_trans is called successfully
   results in freeing the PREALLOC reservation.
2. after record_root_in_trans, we convert to PERTRANS, and now the
   transaction owns freeing the reservation.

This patch enforces those properties on the three operations. Without
it, generic/269 with squotas enabled at mkfs time would fail in ~5-10
runs on my system. With this patch, it ran successfully 1000 times in a
row."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

iommu/vt-d: Fix WARN_ON in iommu probe path

Commit 1a75cc710b95 (""iommu/vt-d: Use rbtree to track iommu probed
devices"") adds all devices probed by the iommu driver in a rbtree
indexed by the source ID of each device. It assumes that each device
has a unique source ID. This assumption is incorrect and the VT-d
spec doesn't state this requirement either.

The reason for using a rbtree to track devices is to look up the device
with PCI bus and devfunc in the paths of handling ATS invalidation time
out error and the PRI I/O page faults. Both are PCI ATS feature related.

Only track the devices that have PCI ATS capabilities in the rbtree to
avoid unnecessary WARN_ON in the iommu probe path. Otherwise, on some
platforms below kernel splat will be displayed and the iommu probe results
in failure.

net/mlx5: Properly link new fs rules into the tree

Previously, add_rule_fg would only add newly created rules from the
handle into the tree when they had a refcount of 1. On the other hand,
create_flow_handle tries hard to find and reference already existing
identical rules instead of creating new ones.

These two behaviors can result in a situation where create_flow_handle
1) creates a new rule and references it, then
2) in a subsequent step during the same handle creation references it
   again,
resulting in a rule with a refcount of 2 that is not linked into the
tree, will have a NULL parent and root and will result in a crash when
the flow group is deleted because del_sw_hw_rule, invoked on rule
deletion, assumes node->parent is != NULL.

This happened in the wild, due to another bug related to incorrect
handling of duplicate pkt_reformat ids, which lead to the code in
create_flow_handle incorrectly referencing a just-added rule in the same
flow handle, resulting in the problem described above. Full details are
at [1].

This patch changes add_rule_fg to add new rules without parents into
the tree, properly initializing them and avoiding the crash. This makes
it more consistent with how rules are added to an FTE in
create_flow_handle."	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H

pds_core: Fix pdsc_check_pci_health function to use work thread

When the driver notices fw_status == 0xff it tries to perform a PCI
reset on itself via pci_reset_function() in the context of the driver's
health thread. However, pdsc_reset_prepare calls
pdsc_stop_health_thread(), which attempts to stop/flush the health
thread. This results in a deadlock because the stop/flush will never
complete since the driver called pci_reset_function() from the health
thread context. Fix by changing the pdsc_check_pci_health_function()
to queue a newly introduced pdsc_pci_reset_thread() on the pdsc's
work queue.

ipv6: fix race condition between ipv6_get_ifaddr and ipv6_del_addr

Although ipv6_get_ifaddr walks inet6_addr_lst under the RCU lock, it
still means hlist_for_each_entry_rcu can return an item that got removed
from the list. The memory itself of such item is not freed thanks to RCU
but nothing guarantees the actual content of the memory is sane.

In particular, the reference count can be zero. This can happen if
ipv6_del_addr is called in parallel. ipv6_del_addr removes the entry
from inet6_addr_lst (hlist_del_init_rcu(&ifp->addr_lst)) and drops all
references (__in6_ifa_put(ifp) + in6_ifa_put(ifp)). With bad enough
timing, this can happen:

1. In ipv6_get_ifaddr, hlist_for_each_entry_rcu returns an entry.

2. Then, the whole ipv6_del_addr is executed for the given entry. The
   reference count drops to zero and kfree_rcu is scheduled.

3. ipv6_get_ifaddr continues and tries to increments the reference count
   (in6_ifa_hold).

4. The rcu is unlocked and the entry is freed.

5. The freed entry is returned.

Prevent increasing of the reference count in such case. The name
in6_ifa_hold_safe is chosen to mimic the existing fib6_info_hold_safe.

CVE-2024-35970	2024-05-20T10:15:11.860	2025-04-04T14:45:14.893	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_unix: Clear stale u->oob_skb.

syzkaller started to report deadlock of unix_gc_lock after commit
4090fa373f0e (""af_unix: Replace garbage collection algorithm.""), but
it just uncovers the bug that has been there since commit 314001f0bf92
(""af_unix: Add OOB support"").

The repro basically does the following.

  from socket import *
  from array import array

  c1, c2 = socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM)
  c1.sendmsg([b'a'], [(SOL_SOCKET, SCM_RIGHTS, array(""i"", [c2.fileno()]))], MSG_OOB)
  c2.recv(1)  # blocked as no normal data in recv queue

  c2.close()  # done async and unblock recv()
  c1.close()  # done async and trigger GC

A socket sends its file descriptor to itself as OOB data and tries to
receive normal data, but finally recv() fails due to async close().

The problem here is wrong handling of OOB skb in manage_oob().  When
recvmsg() is called without MSG_OOB, manage_oob() is called to check
if the peeked skb is OOB skb.  In such a case, manage_oob() pops it
out of the receive queue but does not clear unix_sock(sk)->oob_skb.
This is wrong in terms of uAPI.

Let's say we send ""hello"" with MSG_OOB, and ""world"" without MSG_OOB.
The 'o' is handled as OOB data.  When recv() is called twice without
MSG_OOB, the OOB data should be lost.

  >>> from socket import *
  >>> c1, c2 = socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0)
  >>> c1.send(b'hello', MSG_OOB)  # 'o' is OOB data
  5
  >>> c1.send(b'world')
  5
  >>> c2.recv(5)  # OOB data is not received
  b'hell'
  >>> c2.recv(5)  # OOB date is skipped
  b'world'
  >>> c2.recv(5, MSG_OOB)  # This should return an error
  b'o'

In the same situation, TCP actually returns -EINVAL for the last
recv().

Also, if we do not clear unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb, unix_poll() always set
EPOLLPRI even though the data has passed through by previous recv().

To avoid these issues, we must clear unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb when dequeuing
it from recv queue.

The reason why the old GC did not trigger the deadlock is because the
old GC relied on the receive queue to detect the loop.

When it is triggered, the socket with OOB data is marked as GC candidate
because file refcount == inflight count (1).  However, after traversing
all inflight sockets, the socket still has a positive inflight count (1),
thus the socket is excluded from candidates.  Then, the old GC lose the
chance to garbage-collect the socket.

With the old GC, the repro continues to create true garbage that will
never be freed nor detected by kmemleak as it's linked to the global
inflight list.  That's why we couldn't even notice the issue."	6.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

net: ks8851: Handle softirqs at the end of IRQ thread to fix hang

The ks8851_irq() thread may call ks8851_rx_pkts() in case there are
any packets in the MAC FIFO, which calls netif_rx(). This netif_rx()
implementation is guarded by local_bh_disable() and local_bh_enable().
The local_bh_enable() may call do_softirq() to run softirqs in case
any are pending. One of the softirqs is net_rx_action, which ultimately
reaches the driver .start_xmit callback. If that happens, the system
hangs. The entire call chain is below:

ks8851_start_xmit_par from netdev_start_xmit
netdev_start_xmit from dev_hard_start_xmit
dev_hard_start_xmit from sch_direct_xmit
sch_direct_xmit from __dev_queue_xmit
__dev_queue_xmit from __neigh_update
__neigh_update from neigh_update
neigh_update from arp_process.constprop.0
arp_process.constprop.0 from __netif_receive_skb_one_core
__netif_receive_skb_one_core from process_backlog
process_backlog from __napi_poll.constprop.0
__napi_poll.constprop.0 from net_rx_action
net_rx_action from __do_softirq
__do_softirq from call_with_stack
call_with_stack from do_softirq
do_softirq from __local_bh_enable_ip
__local_bh_enable_ip from netif_rx
netif_rx from ks8851_irq
ks8851_irq from irq_thread_fn
irq_thread_fn from irq_thread
irq_thread from kthread
kthread from ret_from_fork

The hang happens because ks8851_irq() first locks a spinlock in
ks8851_par.c ks8851_lock_par() spin_lock_irqsave(&ksp->lock, ...)
and with that spinlock locked, calls netif_rx(). Once the execution
reaches ks8851_start_xmit_par(), it calls ks8851_lock_par() again
which attempts to claim the already locked spinlock again, and the
hang happens.

Move the do_softirq() call outside of the spinlock protected section
of ks8851_irq() by disabling BHs around the entire spinlock protected
section of ks8851_irq() handler. Place local_bh_enable() outside of
the spinlock protected section, so that it can trigger do_softirq()
without the ks8851_par.c ks8851_lock_par() spinlock being held, and
safely call ks8851_start_xmit_par() without attempting to lock the
already locked spinlock.

Since ks8851_irq() is protected by local_bh_disable()/local_bh_enable()
now, replace netif_rx() with __netif_rx() which is not duplicating the
local_bh_disable()/local_bh_enable() calls."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

geneve: fix header validation in geneve[6]_xmit_skb

syzbot is able to trigger an uninit-value in geneve_xmit() [1]

Problem : While most ip tunnel helpers (like ip_tunnel_get_dsfield())
uses skb_protocol(skb, true), pskb_inet_may_pull() is only using
skb->protocol.

If anything else than ETH_P_IPV6 or ETH_P_IP is found in skb->protocol,
pskb_inet_may_pull() does nothing at all.

If a vlan tag was provided by the caller (af_packet in the syzbot case),
the network header might not point to the correct location, and skb
linear part could be smaller than expected.

Add skb_vlan_inet_prepare() to perform a complete mac validation.

Use this in geneve for the moment, I suspect we need to adopt this
more broadly.

v4 - Jakub reported v3 broke l2_tos_ttl_inherit.sh selftest
   - Only call __vlan_get_protocol() for vlan types.

v2,v3 - Addressed Sabrina comments on v1 and v2

platform/chrome: cros_ec_uart: properly fix race condition

The cros_ec_uart_probe() function calls devm_serdev_device_open() before
it calls serdev_device_set_client_ops(). This can trigger a NULL pointer
dereference:

     ? ttyport_receive_buf

A simplified version of crashing code is as follows:

    static inline size_t serdev_controller_receive_buf(struct serdev_controller *ctrl,
                                                      const u8 *data,

            struct serdev_device *serdev = ctrl->serdev;

            if (!serdev || !serdev->ops->receive_buf) // CRASH!
                return 0;

            return serdev->ops->receive_buf(serdev, data, count);
    }

It assumes that if SERPORT_ACTIVE is set and serdev exists, serdev->ops
will also exist. This conflicts with the existing cros_ec_uart_probe()
logic, as it first calls devm_serdev_device_open() (which sets
SERPORT_ACTIVE), and only later sets serdev->ops via
serdev_device_set_client_ops().

Commit 01f95d42b8f4 (""platform/chrome: cros_ec_uart: fix race

so, made the window of error for this race condition to happen much

arm64: tlb: Fix TLBI RANGE operand

KVM/arm64 relies on TLBI RANGE feature to flush TLBs when the dirty
pages are collected by VMM and the page table entries become write
protected during live migration. Unfortunately, the operand passed
to the TLBI RANGE instruction isn't correctly sorted out due to the
commit 117940aa6e5f (""KVM: arm64: Define kvm_tlb_flush_vmid_range()"").
It leads to crash on the destination VM after live migration because
TLBs aren't flushed completely and some of the dirty pages are missed.

For example, I have a VM where 8GB memory is assigned, starting from
0x40000000 (1GB). Note that the host has 4KB as the base page size.
In the middile of migration, kvm_tlb_flush_vmid_range() is executed
to flush TLBs. It passes MAX_TLBI_RANGE_PAGES as the argument to
__kvm_tlb_flush_vmid_range() and __flush_s2_tlb_range_op(). SCALE#3
and NUM#31, corresponding to MAX_TLBI_RANGE_PAGES, isn't supported
by __TLBI_RANGE_NUM(). In this specific case, -1 has been returned
from __TLBI_RANGE_NUM() for SCALE#3/2/1/0 and rejected by the loop
in the __flush_tlb_range_op() until the variable @scale underflows
and becomes -9, 0xffff708000040000 is set as the operand. The operand
is wrong since it's sorted out by __TLBI_VADDR_RANGE() according to
invalid @scale and @num.

Fix it by extending __TLBI_RANGE_NUM() to support the combination of
SCALE#3 and NUM#31. With the changes, [-1 31] instead of [-1 30] can
be returned from the macro, meaning the TLBs for 0x200000 pages in the
above example can be flushed in one shoot with SCALE#3 and NUM#31. The
macro TLBI_RANGE_MASK is dropped since no one uses it any more. The
comments are also adjusted accordingly."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

virtio_net: Do not send RSS key if it is not supported

There is a bug when setting the RSS options in virtio_net that can break
the whole machine, getting the kernel into an infinite loop.

Running the following command in any QEMU virtual machine with virtionet
will reproduce this problem:

    # ethtool -X eth0  hfunc toeplitz

This is how the problem happens:

1) ethtool_set_rxfh() calls virtnet_set_rxfh()

2) virtnet_set_rxfh() calls virtnet_commit_rss_command()

3) virtnet_commit_rss_command() populates 4 entries for the rss
scatter-gather

4) Since the command above does not have a key, then the last
scatter-gatter entry will be zeroed, since rss_key_size == 0.
sg_buf_size = vi->rss_key_size;

5) This buffer is passed to qemu, but qemu is not happy with a buffer
with zero length, and do the following in virtqueue_map_desc() (QEMU
function):

  if (!sz) {
      virtio_error(vdev, ""virtio: zero sized buffers are not allowed"");

6) virtio_error() (also QEMU function) set the device as broken

    vdev->broken = true;

7) Qemu bails out, and do not repond this crazy kernel.

8) The kernel is waiting for the response to come back (function
virtnet_send_command())

9) The kernel is waiting doing the following :

      while (!virtqueue_get_buf(vi->cvq, &tmp) &&
	     !virtqueue_is_broken(vi->cvq))
	      cpu_relax();

10) None of the following functions above is true, thus, the kernel
loops here forever. Keeping in mind that virtqueue_is_broken() does
not look at the qemu `vdev->broken`, so, it never realizes that the
vitio is broken at QEMU side.

on top of batman-adv. In this case, at least 116 byte would be needed.
There will just be an endless spam of

   batman_adv: batadv0: Forced to purge local tt entries to fit new maximum fragment MTU (110)

in the log but the function will never finish. Problem here is that the
timeout will be halved all the time and will then stagnate at 0 and
therefore never be able to reduce the table even more.

There are other scenarios possible with a similar result. The number of
BATADV_TT_CLIENT_NOPURGE entries in the local TT can for example be too
high to fit inside a packet. Such a scenario can therefore happen also with
only a single VLAN + 7 non-purgable addresses - requiring at least 120
bytes.

While this should be handled proactively when:

* interface with too low MTU is added
* VLAN is added
* non-purgeable local mac is added
* MTU of an attached interface is reduced
* fragmentation setting gets disabled (which most likely requires dropping
  attached interfaces)

not all of these scenarios can be prevented because batman-adv is only
consuming events without the the possibility to prevent these actions
(non-purgable MAC address added, MTU of an attached interface is reduced).
It is therefore necessary to also make sure that the code is able to handle
also the situations when there were already incompatible system
configuration are present."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

sched/eevdf: Prevent vlag from going out of bounds in reweight_eevdf()

It was possible to have pick_eevdf() return NULL, which then causes a
NULL-deref. This turned out to be due to entity_eligible() returning
falsely negative because of a s64 multiplcation overflow.

Specifically, reweight_eevdf() computes the vlag without considering
the limit placed upon vlag as update_entity_lag() does, and then the
scaling multiplication (remember that weight is 20bit fixed point) can
overflow. This then leads to the new vruntime being weird which then
causes the above entity_eligible() to go side-ways and claim nothing
is eligible.

mm: turn folio_test_hugetlb into a PageType

The current folio_test_hugetlb() can be fooled by a concurrent folio split

This can't happen if the caller holds a refcount on it, but we have a few
places (memory-failure, compaction, procfs) which do not and should not
take a speculative reference.

Since hugetlb pages do not use individual page mapcounts (they are always
fully mapped and use the entire_mapcount field to record the number of
mappings), the PageType field is available now that page_mapcount()
ignores the value in this field.

In compaction and with CONFIG_DEBUG_VM enabled, the current implementation
can result in an oops, as reported by Luis. This happens since 9c5ccf2db04b

firmware: qcom: uefisecapp: Fix memory related IO errors and crashes

It turns out that while the QSEECOM APP_SEND command has specific fields
for request and response buffers, uefisecapp expects them both to be in
a single memory region. Failure to adhere to this has (so far) resulted
in either no response being written to the response buffer (causing an
EIO to be emitted down the line), the SCM call to fail with EINVAL
(i.e., directly from TZ/firmware), or the device to be hard-reset.

While this issue can be triggered deterministically, in the current form
it seems to happen rather sporadically (which is why it has gone
unnoticed during earlier testing). This is likely due to the two
kzalloc() calls (for request and response) being directly after each
other. Which means that those likely return consecutive regions most of
the time, especially when not much else is going on in the system.

Fix this by allocating a single memory region for both request and
response buffers, properly aligning both structs inside it. This
unfortunately also means that the qcom_scm_qseecom_app_send() interface
needs to be restructured, as it should no longer map the DMA regions
separately. Therefore, move the responsibility of DMA allocation (or
mapping) to the caller."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Instead, use access_width to determine the size and use the offset and
width to shift and mask the bits to read/write out. Make sure to add a
check for system memory since pcc redefines the access_width to
subspace id.

If access_width is not set, then fall back to using bit_width.

Rename x86's to CPU_MITIGATIONS, define it in generic code, and force it

mitigations off by default if SPECULATION_MITIGATIONS=n kinda sorta
missed that ""cpu_mitigations"" is completely generic, whereas
SPECULATION_MITIGATIONS is x86-specific.

Rename x86's SPECULATIVE_MITIGATIONS instead of keeping both and have it
select CPU_MITIGATIONS, as having two configs for the same thing is
unnecessary and confusing.  This will also allow x86 to use the knob to
manage mitigations that aren't strictly related to speculative
execution.

Use another Kconfig to communicate to common code that CPU_MITIGATIONS
is already defined instead of having x86's menu depend on the common
CPU_MITIGATIONS.  This allows keeping a single point of contact for all
of x86's mitigations, and it's not clear that other architectures *want*
to allow disabling mitigations at compile-time."

HID: i2c-hid: remove I2C_HID_READ_PENDING flag to prevent lock-up

The flag I2C_HID_READ_PENDING is used to serialize I2C operations.
However, this is not necessary, because I2C core already has its own
locking for that.

More importantly, this flag can cause a lock-up: if the flag is set in
i2c_hid_xfer() and an interrupt happens, the interrupt handler
(i2c_hid_irq) will check this flag and return immediately without doing
anything, then the interrupt handler will be invoked again in an
infinite loop.

Since interrupt handler is an RT task, it takes over the CPU and the
flag-clearing task never gets scheduled, thus we have a lock-up.

netfs: Fix the pre-flush when appending to a file in writethrough mode

In netfs_perform_write(), when the file is marked NETFS_ICTX_WRITETHROUGH
or O_*SYNC or RWF_*SYNC was specified, write-through caching is performed
on a buffered file.  When setting up for write-through, we flush any
conflicting writes in the region and wait for the write to complete,
failing if there's a write error to return.

The issue arises if we're writing at or above the EOF position because we
skip the flush and - more importantly - the wait.  This becomes a problem
if there's a partial folio at the end of the file that is being written out
and we want to make a write to it too.  Both the already-running write and
the write we start both want to clear the writeback mark, but whoever is
second causes a warning looking something like:

Fix this by making the flush-and-wait unconditional.  It will do nothing if
there are no folios in the pagecache and will return quickly if there are
no folios in the region specified.

Further, move the WBC attachment above the flush call as the flush is going
to attach a WBC and detach it again if it is not present - and since we
need one anyway we might as well share it."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

ice: fix LAG and VF lock dependency in ice_reset_vf()

9f74a3dfcf83 (""ice: Fix VF Reset paths when interface in a failed over

The commit placed this lock acquisition just prior to the acquisition of
the VF configuration lock.

If ice_reset_vf() acquires the configuration lock via the ICE_VF_RESET_LOCK
flag, this could deadlock with ice_vc_cfg_qs_msg() because it always
acquires the locks in the order of the VF configuration lock and then the
LAG mutex.

mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix incorrect list API usage

Both the function that migrates all the chunks within a region and the
function that migrates all the entries within a chunk call
list_first_entry() on the respective lists without checking that the
lists are not empty. This is incorrect usage of the API, which leads to
the following warning [1].

Fix by returning if the lists are empty as there is nothing to migrate
in this case.

mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix warning during rehash

As previously explained, the rehash delayed work migrates filters from
one region to another. This is done by iterating over all chunks (all
the filters with the same priority) in the region and in each chunk
iterating over all the filters.

When the work runs out of credits it stores the current chunk and entry
as markers in the per-work context so that it would know where to resume
the migration from the next time the work is scheduled.

Upon error, the chunk marker is reset to NULL, but without resetting the
entry markers despite being relative to it. This can result in migration
being resumed from an entry that does not belong to the chunk being
migrated. In turn, this will eventually lead to a chunk being iterated
over as if it is an entry. Because of how the two structures happen to
be defined, this does not lead to KASAN splats, but to warnings such as
[1].

Fix by creating a helper that resets all the markers and call it from
all the places the currently only reset the chunk marker. For good
measures also call it when starting a completely new rehash. Add a
warning to avoid future cases.

It was discovered recently that when we deallocate a node, in some cases only the first memory chunk is deallocated, and the rest of the memory chunks remain (incorrectly) allocated, causing a memory leak. In the worst case, depending on how a canister uses the BTreeMap, an adversary could interact with the canister through its API and trigger interactions with the map that keep consuming memory due to the memory leak. This could potentially lead to using an excessive amount of memory, or even running out of memory.

This issue has been fixed in  #212 https://github.com/dfinity/stable-structures/pull/212  by changing the logic for deallocating nodes to ensure that all of a node's memory chunks are deallocated and users are asked to upgrade to version 0.6.4.. Tests have been added to prevent regressions of this nature moving forward. Note: Users of stable-structure < 0.6.0 are not affected.

Users who are not storing unbounded types in BTreeMap are not affected and do not need to upgrade. Otherwise, an upgrade to version 0.6.4 is necessary."	5.9	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

mac80211: fix deadlock in AP/VLAN handling

Syzbot reports that when you have AP_VLAN interfaces that are up

surprise - since we dev_close() them with the wiphy mutex held,
which goes back into the netdev notifier in cfg80211 and tries to
acquire the wiphy mutex there.

To fix this, we need to do two things:
 1) prevent changing iftype while AP_VLANs are up, we can't
    easily fix this case since cfg80211 already calls us with
    the wiphy mutex held, but change_interface() is relatively

x86/fpu: Invalidate FPU state after a failed XRSTOR from a user buffer

Both Intel and AMD consider it to be architecturally valid for XRSTOR to
fail with #PF but nonetheless change the register state.  The actual
conditions under which this might occur are unclear [1], but it seems
plausible that this might be triggered if one sibling thread unmaps a page
and invalidates the shared TLB while another sibling thread is executing
XRSTOR on the page in question.

__fpu__restore_sig() can execute XRSTOR while the hardware registers
are preserved on behalf of a different victim task (using the
fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx mechanism), and, in theory, XRSTOR could fail but
modify the registers.

If this happens, then there is a window in which __fpu__restore_sig()
could schedule out and the victim task could schedule back in without
reloading its own FPU registers. This would result in part of the FPU
state that __fpu__restore_sig() was attempting to load leaking into the
victim task's user-visible state.

Invalidate preserved FPU registers on XRSTOR failure to prevent this
situation from corrupting any state.

x86/fpu: Prevent state corruption in __fpu__restore_sig()

The non-compacted slowpath uses __copy_from_user() and copies the entire
user buffer into the kernel buffer, verbatim.  This means that the kernel
buffer may now contain entirely invalid state on which XRSTOR will #GP.
validate_user_xstate_header() can detect some of that corruption, but that
leaves the onus on callers to clear the buffer.

Prior to XSAVES support, it was possible just to reinitialize the buffer,
completely, but with supervisor states that is not longer possible as the
buffer clearing code split got it backwards. Fixing that is possible but
not corrupting the state in the first place is more robust.

Avoid corruption of the kernel XSAVE buffer by using copy_user_to_xstate()
which validates the XSAVE header contents before copying the actual states
to the kernel. copy_user_to_xstate() was previously only called for
compacted-format kernel buffers, but it works for both compacted and
non-compacted forms.

Using it for the non-compacted form is slower because of multiple
__copy_from_user() operations, but that cost is less important than robust
code in an already slow path.

PCI: aardvark: Fix kernel panic during PIO transfer

Trying to start a new PIO transfer by writing value 0 in PIO_START register
when previous transfer has not yet completed (which is indicated by value 1
in PIO_START) causes an External Abort on CPU, which results in kernel
panic:

    SError Interrupt on CPU0, code 0xbf000002 -- SError
    Kernel panic - not syncing: Asynchronous SError Interrupt

To prevent kernel panic, it is required to reject a new PIO transfer when
previous one has not finished yet.

If previous PIO transfer is not finished yet, the kernel may issue a new
PIO request only if the previous PIO transfer timed out.

In the past the root cause of this issue was incorrectly identified (as it
often happens during link retraining or after link down event) and special
hack was implemented in Trusted Firmware to catch all SError events in EL3,
to ignore errors with code 0xbf000002 and not forwarding any other errors
to kernel and instead throw panic from EL3 Trusted Firmware handler.

Links to discussion and patches about this issue:
https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a.git/commit/?id=3c7dcdac5c50
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20190316161243.29517-1-repk@triplefau.lt/

https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/1541

But the real cause was the fact that during link retraining or after link
down event the PIO transfer may take longer time, up to the 1.44s until it
times out. This increased probability that a new PIO transfer would be
issued by kernel while previous one has not finished yet.

After applying this change into the kernel, it is possible to revert the
mentioned TF-A hack and SError events do not have to be caught in TF-A EL3."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

KVM: x86: Immediately reset the MMU context when the SMM flag is cleared

Immediately reset the MMU context when the vCPU's SMM flag is cleared so
that the SMM flag in the MMU role is always synchronized with the vCPU's
flag.  If RSM fails (which isn't correctly emulated), KVM will bail
without calling post_leave_smm() and leave the MMU in a bad state.

The bad MMU role can lead to a NULL pointer dereference when grabbing a
shadow page's rmap for a page fault as the initial lookups for the gfn
will happen with the vCPU's SMM flag (=0), whereas the rmap lookup will
use the shadow page's SMM flag, which comes from the MMU (=1).  SMM has
an entirely different set of memslots, and so the initial lookup can find
a memslot (SMM=0) and then explode on the rmap memslot lookup (SMM=1).

In commit 24803f38a5c0 (""igmp: do not remove igmp souce list info when set
link down""), the ip_mc_clear_src() in ip_mc_destroy_dev() was removed,
because it was also called in igmpv3_clear_delrec().

Rough callgraph:

inetdev_destroy
-> ip_mc_destroy_dev
     -> igmpv3_clear_delrec
        -> ip_mc_clear_src
-> RCU_INIT_POINTER(dev->ip_ptr, NULL)

However, ip_mc_clear_src() called in igmpv3_clear_delrec() doesn't
release in_dev->mc_list->sources. And RCU_INIT_POINTER() assigns the
NULL to dev->ip_ptr. As a result, in_dev cannot be obtained through
inetdev_by_index() and then in_dev->mc_list->sources cannot be released
by ip_mc_del1_src() in the sock_close. Rough call sequence goes like:

sock_close
-> __sock_release
   -> inet_release
      -> ip_mc_drop_socket
         -> inetdev_by_index
         -> ip_mc_leave_src
            -> ip_mc_del_src
               -> ip_mc_del1_src

So we still need to call ip_mc_clear_src() in ip_mc_destroy_dev() to free
in_dev->mc_list->sources."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

udp: fix race between close() and udp_abort()

Kaustubh reported and diagnosed a panic in udp_lib_lookup().
The root cause is udp_abort() racing with close(). Both
racing functions acquire the socket lock, but udp{v6}_destroy_sock()
release it before performing destructive actions.

We can't easily extend the socket lock scope to avoid the race,
instead use the SOCK_DEAD flag to prevent udp_abort from doing
any action when the critical race happens.

Olga was able to hit this with kernels starting somewhere between 5.7

IB/mlx5: Fix initializing CQ fragments buffer

The function init_cq_frag_buf() can be called to initialize the current CQ
fragments buffer cq->buf, or the temporary cq->resize_buf that is filled
during CQ resize operation.

However, the offending commit started to use function get_cqe() for
getting the CQEs, the issue with this change is that get_cqe() always
returns CQEs from cq->buf, which leads us to initialize the wrong buffer,
and in case of enlarging the CQ we try to access elements beyond the size
of the current cq->buf and eventually hit a kernel panic.

KVM: x86: Ensure liveliness of nested VM-Enter fail tracepoint message

Use the __string() machinery provided by the tracing subystem to make a
copy of the string literals consumed by the ""nested VM-Enter failed""
tracepoint.  A complete copy is necessary to ensure that the tracepoint
can't outlive the data/memory it consumes and deference stale memory.

Because the tracepoint itself is defined by kvm, if kvm-intel and/or
kvm-amd are built as modules, the memory holding the string literals
defined by the vendor modules will be freed when the module is unloaded,
whereas the tracepoint and its data in the ring buffer will live until
kvm is unloaded (or ""indefinitely"" if kvm is built-in).

This bug has existed since the tracepoint was added, but was recently
exposed by a new check in tracing to detect exactly this type of bug.

CVE-2021-47267	2024-05-21T15:15:15.297	2025-04-04T14:30:02.130	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: fix various gadget panics on 10gbps cabling

usb_assign_descriptors() is called with 5 parameters,
the last 4 of which are the usb_descriptor_header for:
  full-speed (USB1.1 - 12Mbps [including USB1.0 low-speed @ 1.5Mbps),
  high-speed (USB2.0 - 480Mbps),
  super-speed (USB3.0 - 5Gbps),
  super-speed-plus (USB3.1 - 10Gbps).

The differences between full/high/super-speed descriptors are usually
substantial (due to changes in the maximum usb block size from 64 to 512
to 1024 bytes and other differences in the specs), while the difference
between 5 and 10Gbps descriptors may be as little as nothing
(in many cases the same tuning is simply good enough).

However if a gadget driver calls usb_assign_descriptors() with
a NULL descriptor for super-speed-plus and is then used on a max 10gbps
configuration, the kernel will crash with a null pointer dereference,
when a 10gbps capable device port + cable + host port combination shows up.
(This wouldn't happen if the gadget max-speed was set to 5gbps, but
it of course defaults to the maximum, and there's no real reason to
artificially limit it)

The fix is to simply use the 5gbps descriptor as the 10gbps descriptor,
if a 10gbps descriptor wasn't provided.

Obviously this won't fix the problem if the 5gbps descriptor is also
NULL, but such cases can't be so trivially solved (and any such gadgets
are unlikely to be used with USB3 ports any way)."	6.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

usb: dwc3: ep0: fix NULL pointer exception

There is no validation of the index from dwc3_wIndex_to_dep() and we might
be referring a non-existing ep and trigger a NULL pointer exception. In
certain configurations we might use fewer eps and the index might wrongly
indicate a larger ep index than existing.

By adding this validation from the patch we can actually report a wrong
index back to the caller.

In our usecase we are using a composite device on an older kernel, but
upstream might use this fix also. Unfortunately, I cannot describe the
hardware for others to reproduce the issue as it is a proprietary
implementation.

usb: dwc3: gadget: Bail from dwc3_gadget_exit() if dwc->gadget is NULL

There exists a possible scenario in which dwc3_gadget_init() can fail:
during during host -> peripheral mode switch in dwc3_set_mode(), and
a pending gadget driver fails to bind.  Then, if the DRD undergoes
another mode switch from peripheral->host the resulting
dwc3_gadget_exit() will attempt to reference an invalid and dangling
dwc->gadget pointer as well as call dma_free_coherent() on unmapped
DMA pointers.

The exact scenario can be reproduced as follows:
 - Start DWC3 in peripheral mode
 - Configure ConfigFS gadget with FunctionFS instance (or use g_ffs)
 - Run FunctionFS userspace application (open EPs, write descriptors, etc)
 - Bind gadget driver to DWC3's UDC
 - Switch DWC3 to host mode
   => dwc3_gadget_exit() is called. usb_del_gadget() will put the
	ConfigFS driver instance on the gadget_driver_pending_list
 - Stop FunctionFS application (closes the ep files)
 - Switch DWC3 to peripheral mode
   => dwc3_gadget_init() fails as usb_add_gadget() calls
	check_pending_gadget_drivers() and attempts to rebind the UDC
	to the ConfigFS gadget but fails with -19 (-ENODEV) because the
	FFS instance is not in FFS_ACTIVE state (userspace has not
	re-opened and written the descriptors yet, i.e. desc_ready!=0).
 - Switch DWC3 back to host mode
   => dwc3_gadget_exit() is called again, but this time dwc->gadget
	is invalid.

Although it can be argued that userspace should take responsibility
for ensuring that the FunctionFS application be ready prior to
allowing the composite driver bind to the UDC, failure to do so
should not result in a panic from the kernel driver.

Fix this by setting dwc->gadget to NULL in the failure path of
dwc3_gadget_init() and add a check to dwc3_gadget_exit() to bail out
unless the gadget pointer is valid."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2021-47275	2024-05-21T15:15:15.903	2025-04-30T14:49:09.583	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bcache: avoid oversized read request in cache missing code path

In the cache missing code path of cached device, if a proper location
from the internal B+ tree is matched for a cache miss range, function
cached_dev_cache_miss() will be called in cache_lookup_fn() in the
following code block,
[code block 1]
  526         unsigned int sectors = KEY_INODE(k) == s->iop.inode
  527                 ? min_t(uint64_t, INT_MAX,
  528                         KEY_START(k) - bio->bi_iter.bi_sector)
  529                 : INT_MAX;
  530         int ret = s->d->cache_miss(b, s, bio, sectors);

Here s->d->cache_miss() is the call backfunction pointer initialized as
cached_dev_cache_miss(), the last parameter 'sectors' is an important
hint to calculate the size of read request to backing device of the
missing cache data.

Current calculation in above code block may generate oversized value of
'sectors', which consequently may trigger 2 different potential kernel
panics by BUG() or BUG_ON() as listed below,

1) BUG_ON() inside bch_btree_insert_key(),
[code block 2]
   886         BUG_ON(b->ops->is_extents && !KEY_SIZE(k));
2) BUG() inside biovec_slab(),
[code block 3]
   51         default:
   52                 BUG();
   53                 return NULL;

All the above panics are original from cached_dev_cache_miss() by the
oversized parameter 'sectors'.

Inside cached_dev_cache_miss(), parameter 'sectors' is used to calculate
the size of data read from backing device for the cache missing. This
size is stored in s->insert_bio_sectors by the following lines of code,
[code block 4]
  909    s->insert_bio_sectors = min(sectors, bio_sectors(bio) + reada);

Then the actual key inserting to the internal B+ tree is generated and
stored in s->iop.replace_key by the following lines of code,
[code block 5]
  911   s->iop.replace_key = KEY(s->iop.inode,
  912                    bio->bi_iter.bi_sector + s->insert_bio_sectors,
  913                    s->insert_bio_sectors);
The oversized parameter 'sectors' may trigger panic 1) by BUG_ON() from
the above code block.

And the bio sending to backing device for the missing data is allocated
with hint from s->insert_bio_sectors by the following lines of code,
[code block 6]
  926    cache_bio = bio_alloc_bioset(GFP_NOWAIT,
  927                 DIV_ROUND_UP(s->insert_bio_sectors, PAGE_SECTORS),
  928                 &dc->disk.bio_split);
The oversized parameter 'sectors' may trigger panic 2) by BUG() from the
agove code block.

Now let me explain how the panics happen with the oversized 'sectors'.
In code block 5, replace_key is generated by macro KEY(). From the
definition of macro KEY(),
[code block 7]
  71 #define KEY(inode, offset, size)                                  \
  72 ((struct bkey) {                                                  \
  73      .high = (1ULL << 63) | ((__u64) (size) << 20) | (inode),     \
  74      .low = (offset)                                              \
  75 })

Here 'size' is 16bits width embedded in 64bits member 'high' of struct
bkey. But in code block 1, if ""KEY_START(k) - bio->bi_iter.bi_sector"" is
very probably to be larger than (1<<16) - 1, which makes the bkey size
calculation in code block 5 is overflowed. In one bug report the value
of parameter 'sectors' is 131072 (= 1 << 17), the overflowed 'sectors'
results the overflowed s->insert_bio_sectors in code block 4, then makes
size field of s->iop.replace_key to be 0 in code block 5. Then the 0-
sized s->iop.replace_key is inserted into the internal B+ tree as cache
missing check key (a special key to detect and avoid a racing between
normal write request and cache missing read request) as,
[code block 8]
  915   ret = bch_btree_insert_check_key(b, &s->op, &s->iop.replace_key);

Then the 0-sized s->iop.replace_key as 3rd parameter triggers the bkey
size check BUG_ON() in code block 2, and causes the kernel panic 1).

CVE-2021-47277	2024-05-21T15:15:16.053	2025-04-30T14:30:29.513	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

kvm: avoid speculation-based attacks from out-of-range memslot accesses

KVM's mechanism for accessing guest memory translates a guest physical
address (gpa) to a host virtual address using the right-shifted gpa
(also known as gfn) and a struct kvm_memory_slot.  The translation is
performed in __gfn_to_hva_memslot using the following formula:

      hva = slot->userspace_addr + (gfn - slot->base_gfn) * PAGE_SIZE

It is expected that gfn falls within the boundaries of the guest's
physical memory.  However, a guest can access invalid physical addresses
in such a way that the gfn is invalid.

__gfn_to_hva_memslot is called from kvm_vcpu_gfn_to_hva_prot, which first
retrieves a memslot through __gfn_to_memslot.  While __gfn_to_memslot
does check that the gfn falls within the boundaries of the guest's
physical memory or not, a CPU can speculate the result of the check and
continue execution speculatively using an illegal gfn. The speculation
can result in calculating an out-of-bounds hva.  If the resulting host
virtual address is used to load another guest physical address, this
is effectively a Spectre gadget consisting of two consecutive reads,
the second of which is data dependent on the first.

Right now it's not clear if there are any cases in which this is
exploitable.  One interesting case was reported by the original author
of this patch, and involves visiting guest page tables on x86.  Right
now these are not vulnerable because the hva read goes through get_user(),
which contains an LFENCE speculation barrier.  However, there are
patches in progress for x86 uaccess.h to mask kernel addresses instead of
using LFENCE; once these land, a guest could use speculation to read
from the VMM's ring 3 address space.  Other architectures such as ARM
already use the address masking method, and would be susceptible to
this same kind of data-dependent access gadgets.  Therefore, this patch
proactively protects from these attacks by masking out-of-bounds gfns
in __gfn_to_hva_memslot, which blocks speculation of invalid hvas.

Sean Christopherson noted that this patch does not cover
kvm_read_guest_offset_cached.  This however is limited to a few bytes
past the end of the cache, and therefore it is unlikely to be useful in
the context of building a chain of data dependent accesses."	7.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H

spi: bcm2835: Fix out-of-bounds access with more than 4 slaves

Commit 571e31fa60b3 (""spi: bcm2835: Cache CS register value for
->prepare_message()"") limited the number of slaves to 3 at compile-time.
The limitation was necessitated by a statically-sized array prepare_cs[]
in the driver private data which contains a per-slave register value.

The commit sought to enforce the limitation at run-time by setting the
controller's num_chipselect to 3:  Slaves with a higher chipselect are
rejected by spi_add_device().

However the commit neglected that num_chipselect only limits the number
of *native* chipselects.  If GPIO chipselects are specified in the
device tree for more than 3 slaves, num_chipselect is silently raised by
of_spi_get_gpio_numbers() and the result are out-of-bounds accesses to
the statically-sized array prepare_cs[].

As a bandaid fix which is backportable to stable, raise the number of
allowed slaves to 24 (which ""ought to be enough for anybody""), enforce
the limitation on slave ->setup and revert num_chipselect to 3 (which is
the number of native chipselects supported by the controller).

The problem is that the original code is trying to copy 6 bytes of

legitimate compiler warning because memcpy() overruns the length

structure is FW_CONFIGURE_FREE_BUFFERS, instead, because it contains
6 more members apart from the header _hdr_. Also, the name of
the function ngene_command_config_free_buf() suggests that the actual
intention is to ConfigureFreeBuffers, instead of ConfigureBuffers
(which takes place in the function ngene_command_config_buf(), above).

Fix this by enclosing those 6 members of struct FW_CONFIGURE_FREE_BUFFERS
into new struct config, and use &com.cmd.ConfigureFreeBuffers.config as
the destination address, instead of &com.cmd.ConfigureBuffers.config,

bpf: Track subprog poke descriptors correctly and fix use-after-free

Subprograms are calling map_poke_track(), but on program release there is no
hook to call map_poke_untrack(). However, on program release, the aux memory
(and poke descriptor table) is freed even though we still have a reference to
it in the element list of the map aux data. When we run map_poke_run(), we then
end up accessing free'd memory, triggering KASAN in prog_array_map_poke_run():

In general, subprograms do not necessarily manage their own data structures.
For example, BTF func_info and linfo are just pointers to the main program
structure. This allows reference counting and cleanup to be done on the latter
which simplifies their management a bit. The aux->poke_tab struct, however,
did not follow this logic. The initial proposed fix for this use-after-free
bug further embedded poke data tracking into the subprogram with proper
reference counting. However, Daniel and Alexei questioned why we were treating
these objects special; I agree, its unnecessary. The fix here removes the per
subprogram poke table allocation and map tracking and instead simply points
the aux->poke_tab pointer at the main programs poke table. This way, map
tracking is simplified to the main program and we do not need to manage them
per subprogram.

This also means, bpf_prog_free_deferred(), which unwinds the program reference
counting and kfrees objects, needs to ensure that we don't try to double free
the poke_tab when free'ing the subprog structures. This is easily solved by
NULL'ing the poke_tab pointer. The second detail is to ensure that per
subprogram JIT logic only does fixups on poke_tab[] entries it owns. To do
this, we add a pointer in the poke structure to point at the subprogram value
so JITs can easily check while walking the poke_tab structure if the current
entry belongs to the current program. The aux pointer is stable and therefore
suitable for such comparison. On the jit_subprogs() error path, we omit
cleaning up the poke->aux field because these are only ever referenced from
the JIT side, but on error we will never make it to the JIT, so its fine to
leave them dangling. Removing these pointers would complicate the error path
for no reason. However, we do need to untrack all poke descriptors from the
main program as otherwise they could race with the freeing of JIT memory from
the subprograms. Lastly, a748c6975dea3 (""bpf: propagate poke des

tcp: fix tcp_init_transfer() to not reset icsk_ca_initialized

This commit fixes a bug (found by syzkaller) that could cause spurious
double-initializations for congestion control modules, which could cause
memory leaks or other problems for congestion control modules (like CDG)
that allocate memory in their init functions.

The buggy scenario constructed by syzkaller was something like:

(1) create a TCP socket
(2) initiate a TFO connect via sendto()
(3) while socket is in TCP_SYN_SENT, call setsockopt(TCP_CONGESTION),
    which calls:
       tcp_set_congestion_control() ->
         tcp_reinit_congestion_control() ->
           tcp_init_congestion_control()
(4) receive ACK, connection is established, call tcp_init_transfer(),
    set icsk_ca_initialized=0 (without first calling cc->release()),
    call tcp_init_congestion_control() again.

Note that in this sequence tcp_init_congestion_control() is called
twice without a cc->release() call in between. Thus, for CC modules
that allocate memory in their init() function, e.g, CDG, a memory leak
may occur. The syzkaller tool managed to find a reproducer that
triggered such a leak in CDG.

The bug was introduced when that commit 8919a9b31eb4 (""tcp: Only init
congestion control if not initialized already"")
introduced icsk_ca_initialized and set icsk_ca_initialized to 0 in
tcp_init_transfer(), missing the possibility for a sequence like the
one above, where a process could call setsockopt(TCP_CONGESTION) in
state TCP_SYN_SENT (i.e. after the connect() or TFO open sendmsg()),
which would call tcp_init_congestion_control(). It did not intend to
reset any initialization that the user had already explicitly made;
it just missed the possibility of that particular sequence (which
syzkaller managed to find)."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Commit 91c960b0056672 (""bpf: Rename BPF_XADD and prepare to encode other

distinguish instructions based on the immediate field. Existing JIT

reject programs utilizing anything more than BPF_ADD (such as BPF_FETCH)
in the immediate field.

However, the check added to powerpc64 JIT did not look at the correct

There is an issue with the ASPM(optional) capability checking function.
A device might be attached to root complex directly, in this case,
bus->self(bridge) will be NULL, thus priv->parent_pdev is NULL.
Since alcor_pci_init_check_aspm(priv->parent_pdev) checks the PCI link's
ASPM capability and populate parent_cap_off, which will be used later by
alcor_pci_aspm_ctrl() to dynamically turn on/off device, what we can do
here is to avoid checking the capability if we are on the root complex.
This will make pdev_cap_off 0 and alcor_pci_aspm_ctrl() will simply
return when bring called, effectively disable ASPM for the device.

scsi: core: Fix bad pointer dereference when ehandler kthread is invalid

Commit 66a834d09293 (""scsi: core: Fix error handling of scsi_host_alloc()"")
changed the allocation logic to call put_device() to perform host cleanup
with the assumption that IDA removal and stopping the kthread would
properly be performed in scsi_host_dev_release(). However, in the unlikely
case that the error handler thread fails to spawn, shost->ehandler is set
to ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM).

The error handler cleanup code in scsi_host_dev_release() will call
kthread_stop() if shost->ehandler != NULL which will always be the case
whether the kthread was successfully spawned or not. In the case that it
failed to spawn this has the nasty side effect of trying to dereference an
invalid pointer when kthread_stop() is called. The following splat provides
an example of this behavior in the wild:

As seen from a recent syzbot bug report, mistakes in the compat ioctl

The reported bug is now fixed, but it's possible that other related
bugs are still present or get added in the future. As the drivers need
to check user input already, the possible impact is fairly low, but it
might still cause an information leak.

CVE-2021-47350	2024-05-21T15:15:21.483	2025-04-02T14:54:52.757	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/mm: Fix lockup on kernel exec fault

The powerpc kernel is not prepared to handle exec faults from kernel.
Especially, the function is_exec_fault() will return 'false' when an
exec fault is taken by kernel, because the check is based on reading
current->thread.regs->trap which contains the trap from user.

For instance, when provoking a LKDTM EXEC_USERSPACE test,
current->thread.regs->trap is set to SYSCALL trap (0xc00), and
the fault taken by the kernel is not seen as an exec fault by
set_access_flags_filter().

Commit d7df2443cd5f (""powerpc/mm: Fix spurious segfaults on radix
with autonuma"") made it clear and handled it properly. But later on
commit d3ca587404b3 (""powerpc/mm: Fix reporting of kernel execute
faults"") removed that handling, introducing test based on error_code.
And here is the problem, because on the 603 all upper bits of SRR1
get cleared when the TLB instruction miss handler bails out to ISI.

Until commit cbd7e6ca0210 (""powerpc/fault: Avoid heavy
search_exception_tables() verification""), an exec fault from kernel
at a userspace address was indirectly caught by the lack of entry for
that address in the exception tables. But after that commit the
kernel mainly relies on KUAP or on core mm handling to catch wrong
user accesses. Here the access is not wrong, so mm handles it.
It is a minor fault because PAGE_EXEC is not set,
set_access_flags_filter() should set PAGE_EXEC and voila.
But as is_exec_fault() returns false as explained in the beginning,
set_access_flags_filter() bails out without setting PAGE_EXEC flag,
which leads to a forever minor exec fault.

As the kernel is not prepared to handle such exec faults, the thing to
do is to fire in bad_kernel_fault() for any exec fault taken by the
kernel, as it was prior to commit d3ca587404b3."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

nexthop: Fix division by zero while replacing a resilient group

The resilient nexthop group torture tests in fib_nexthop.sh exposed a
possible division by zero while replacing a resilient group [1]. The
division by zero occurs when the data path sees a resilient nexthop
group with zero buckets.

The tests replace a resilient nexthop group in a loop while traffic is
forwarded through it. The tests do not specify the number of buckets
while performing the replacement, resulting in the kernel allocating a
stub resilient table (i.e, 'struct nh_res_table') with zero buckets.

This table should never be visible to the data path, but the old nexthop
group (i.e., 'oldg') might still be used by the data path when the stub
table is assigned to it.

Fix this by only assigning the stub table to the old nexthop group after
making sure the group is no longer used by the data path.

Tested with fib_nexthops.sh:

afs: Fix corruption in reads at fpos 2G-4G from an OpenAFS server

AFS-3 has two data fetch RPC variants, FS.FetchData and FS.FetchData64, and
Linux's afs client switches between them when talking to a non-YFS server
if the read size, the file position or the sum of the two have the upper 32
bits set of the 64-bit value.

This is a problem, however, since the file position and length fields of
FS.FetchData are *signed* 32-bit values.

Fix this by capturing the capability bits obtained from the fileserver when
it's sent an FS.GetCapabilities RPC, rather than just discarding them, and
then picking out the VICED_CAPABILITY_64BITFILES flag.  This can then be
used to decide whether to use FS.FetchData or FS.FetchData64 - and also
FS.StoreData or FS.StoreData64 - rather than using upper_32_bits() to
switch on the parameter values.

This capabilities flag could also be used to limit the maximum size of the
file, but all servers must be checked for that.

Note that the issue does not exist with FS.StoreData - that uses *unsigned*
32-bit values.  It's also not a problem with Auristor servers as its
YFS.FetchData64 op uses unsigned 64-bit values.

This can be tested by cloning a git repo through an OpenAFS client to an
OpenAFS server and then doing ""git status"" on it from a Linux afs
client[1].  Provided the clone has a pack file that's in the 2G-4G range,
the git status will show errors like:

	error: packfile .git/objects/pack/pack-5e813c51d12b6847bbc0fcd97c2bca66da50079c.pack does not match index
	error: packfile .git/objects/pack/pack-5e813c51d12b6847bbc0fcd97c2bca66da50079c.pack does not match index

s390/qeth: fix NULL deref in qeth_clear_working_pool_list()

When qeth_set_online() calls qeth_clear_working_pool_list() to roll
back after an error exit from qeth_hardsetup_card(), we are at risk of
accessing card->qdio.in_q before it was allocated by
qeth_alloc_qdio_queues() via qeth_mpc_initialize().

qeth_clear_working_pool_list() then dereferences NULL, and by writing to
queue->bufs[i].pool_entry scribbles all over the CPU's lowcore.
Resulting in a crash when those lowcore areas are used next (eg. on
the next machine-check interrupt).

Such a scenario would typically happen when the device is first set
online and its queues aren't allocated yet. An early IO error or certain
misconfigs (eg. mismatched transport mode, bad portno) then cause us to
error out from qeth_hardsetup_card() with card->qdio.in_q still being
NULL.

Fix it by checking the pointer for NULL before accessing it.

Note that we also have (rare) paths inside qeth_mpc_initialize() where
a configuration change can cause us to free the existing queues,
expecting that subsequent code will allocate them again. If we then
error out before that re-allocation happens, the same bug occurs.

CVE-2021-47371	2024-05-21T15:15:23.000	2025-04-02T14:53:12.310	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nexthop: Fix memory leaks in nexthop notification chain listeners

syzkaller discovered memory leaks [1] that can be reduced to the
following commands:

 # ip nexthop add id 1 blackhole
 # devlink dev reload pci/0000:06:00.0

As part of the reload flow, mlxsw will unregister its netdevs and then
unregister from the nexthop notification chain. Before unregistering
from the notification chain, mlxsw will receive delete notifications for
nexthop objects using netdevs registered by mlxsw or their uppers. mlxsw
will not receive notifications for nexthops using netdevs that are not
dismantled as part of the reload flow. For example, the blackhole
nexthop above that internally uses the loopback netdev as its nexthop
device.

One way to fix this problem is to have listeners flush their nexthop
tables after unregistering from the notification chain. This is
error-prone as evident by this patch and also not symmetric with the
registration path where a listener receives a dump of all the existing
nexthops.

Therefore, fix this problem by replaying delete notifications for the
listener being unregistered. This is symmetric to the registration path
and also consistent with the netdev notification chain.

The above means that unregister_nexthop_notifier(), like
register_nexthop_notifier(), will have to take RTNL in order to iterate
over the existing nexthops and that any callers of the function cannot
hold RTNL. This is true for mlxsw and netdevsim, but not for the VXLAN
driver. To avoid a deadlock, change the latter to unregister its nexthop
listener without holding RTNL, making it symmetric to the registration
path.

This issue happens when a userspace program does an ioctl
FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO passing the fb_var_screeninfo struct

If this struct is the same as the previous ioctl, the
vc_resize() detects it and doesn't call the resize_screen(),
leaving the fb_var_screeninfo incomplete. And this leads to
the updatescrollmode() calculates a wrong value to
fbcon_display->vrows, which makes the real_y() return a
wrong value of y, and that value, eventually, causes
the imageblit to access an out-of-bound address value.

the lower 16 bits of it with bitmap_zero() for no particular reason (my
guess would be that 'bitmap' and 'vcpu_bitmap' variables in

rdma_addr_cancel() expects there to be one req on the list and only
cancels the first one. The self-removal behavior of the work only happens
after the handler has returned. This yields a situations where the
req_list can have two reqs for the same ""handle"" but rdma_addr_cancel()
only cancels the first one.

The second req remains active beyond rdma_destroy_id() and will
use-after-free id_priv once it inevitably triggers.

Fix this by remembering if the id_priv has called rdma_resolve_ip() and
always cancel before calling it again. This ensures the req_list never
gets more than one item in it and doesn't cost anything in the normal flow

CVE-2021-47393	2024-05-21T15:15:24.627	2025-09-23T20:17:04.563	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hwmon: (mlxreg-fan) Return non-zero value when fan current state is enforced from sysfs

Fan speed minimum can be enforced from sysfs. For example, setting
current fan speed to 20 is used to enforce fan speed to be at 100%
speed, 19 - to be not below 90% speed, etcetera. This feature provides
ability to limit fan speed according to some system wise
considerations, like absence of some replaceable units or high system
ambient temperature.

Request for changing fan minimum speed is configuration request and can
be set only through 'sysfs' write procedure. In this situation value of
argument 'state' is above nominal fan speed maximum.

Return non-zero code in this case to avoid
thermal_cooling_device_stats_update() call, because in this case
statistics update violates thermal statistics table range.
The issues is observed in case kernel is configured with option
CONFIG_THERMAL_STATISTICS.

mac80211-hwsim: fix late beacon hrtimer handling

Thomas explained in https://lore.kernel.org/r/87mtoeb4hb.ffs@tglx
that our handling of the hrtimer here is wrong: If the timer fires
late (e.g. due to vCPU scheduling, as reported by Dmitry/syzbot)
then it tries to actually rearm the timer at the next deadline,
which might be in the past already:

 1          2          3          N          N+1
 |          |          |   ...    |          |

 ^ intended to fire here (1)
            ^ next deadline here (2)
                                      ^ actually fired here

The next time it fires, it's later, but will still try to schedule
for the next deadline (now 3), etc. until it catches up with N,
but that might take a long time, causing stalls etc.

Now, all of this is simulation, so we just have to fix it, but
note that the behaviour is wrong even per spec, since there's no
value then in sending all those beacons unaligned - they should be
aligned to the TBTT (1, 2, 3, ... in the picture), and if we're a
bit (or a lot) late, then just resume at that point.

Therefore, change the code to use hrtimer_forward_now() which will
ensure that the next firing of the timer would be at N+1 (in the
picture), i.e. the next interval point after the current time."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

ixgbe: Fix NULL pointer dereference in ixgbe_xdp_setup

The ixgbe driver currently generates a NULL pointer dereference with
some machine (online cpus < 63). This is due to the fact that the
maximum value of num_xdp_queues is nr_cpu_ids. Code is in
""ixgbe_set_rss_queues"""".

Here's how the problem repeats itself:
Some machine (online cpus < 63), And user set num_queues to 63 through
ethtool. Code is in the ""ixgbe_set_channels"",
	adapter->ring_feature[RING_F_FDIR].limit = count;

It becomes 63.

When user use xdp, ""ixgbe_set_rss_queues"" will set queues num.
	adapter->num_rx_queues = rss_i;
	adapter->num_tx_queues = rss_i;
	adapter->num_xdp_queues = ixgbe_xdp_queues(adapter);

And rss_i's value is from
	f = &adapter->ring_feature[RING_F_FDIR];
	rss_i = f->indices = f->limit;

So ""num_rx_queues"" > ""num_xdp_queues"", when run to ""ixgbe_xdp_setup"",
	for (i = 0; i < adapter->num_rx_queues; i++)
		if (adapter->xdp_ring[i]->xsk_umem)

It leads to panic.

ext4: add error checking to ext4_ext_replay_set_iblocks()

If the call to ext4_map_blocks() fails due to an corrupted file
system, ext4_ext_replay_set_iblocks() can get stuck in an infinite
loop.  This could be reproduced by running generic/526 with a file
system that has inline_data and fast_commit enabled.  The system will
repeatedly log to the console:

EXT4-fs warning (device dm-3): ext4_block_to_path:105: block 1074800922 > max in inode 131076

and the stack that it gets stuck in is:

   ext4_fill_super+0x22d4/0x2c00

With this patch, generic/526 still fails, but system is no longer
locking up in a tight loop.  It's likely the root casue is that
fast_commit replay is corrupting file systems with inline_data, and we
probably need to add better error handling in the fast commit replay
code path beyond what is done here, which essentially just breaks the
infinite loop without reporting the to the higher levels of the code."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

netfilter: conntrack: serialize hash resizes and cleanups

Syzbot was able to trigger the following warning [1]

No repro found by syzbot yet but I was able to trigger similar issue
by having 2 scripts running in parallel, changing conntrack hash sizes,
and:

for j in `seq 1 1000` ; do unshare -n /bin/true >/dev/null ; done

It would take more than 5 minutes for net_namespace structures
to be cleaned up.

This is because nf_ct_iterate_cleanup() has to restart everytime
a resize happened.

By adding a mutex, we can serialize hash resizes and cleanups
and also make get_next_corpse() faster by skipping over empty
buckets.

Even without resizes in the picture, this patch considerably
speeds up network namespace dismantles.

block: don't call rq_qos_ops->done_bio if the bio isn't tracked

rq_qos framework is only applied on request based driver, so:

1) rq_qos_done_bio() needn't to be called for bio based driver

2) rq_qos_done_bio() needn't to be called for bio which isn't tracked,
such as bios ended from error handling code.

Especially in bio_endio():

1) request queue is referred via bio->bi_bdev->bd_disk->queue, which
may be gone since request queue refcount may not be held in above two
cases

2) q->rq_qos may be freed in blk_cleanup_queue() when calling into
__rq_qos_done_bio()

Fix the potential kernel panic by not calling rq_qos_ops->done_bio if
the bio isn't tracked. This way is safe because both ioc_rqos_done_bio()

core populates the usb_phy passed via 'phys' inside 'struct ci_hdrc'

This causes the NULL pointer dereference inside imx7d_charger_detection().

Fix it by also searching for 'phys' in case 'fsl,usbphy' is not found.

While ftrace is looping over a list of addresses to patch, it always failed
when patching the same function: riscv_cpuid_to_hartid_mask. Looking at the
backtrace, the illegal instruction is encountered in this same function.
However, patch_text_nosync, after patching the instructions, calls
flush_icache_range. But looking at what happens in this function:

flush_icache_range -> flush_icache_all
                   -> sbi_remote_fence_i
                   -> __sbi_rfence_v02
                   -> riscv_cpuid_to_hartid_mask

The icache and dcache of the current cpu are never synchronized between the
patching of riscv_cpuid_to_hartid_mask and calling this same function.

So fix this by flushing the current cpu's icache before asking for the other
cpus to do the same."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

powerpc/64s: fix program check interrupt emergency stack path

Emergency stack path was jumping into a 3: label inside the
__GEN_COMMON_BODY macro for the normal path after it had finished,
rather than jumping over it. By a small miracle this is the correct
place to build up a new interrupt frame with the existing stack
pointer, so things basically worked okay with an added weird looking
700 trap frame on top (which had the wrong ->nip so it didn't decode
bug messages either).

Fix this by avoiding using numeric labels when jumping over non-trivial
macros.

powerpc/64s: Fix unrecoverable MCE calling async handler from NMI

The machine check handler is not considered NMI on 64s. The early
handler is the true NMI handler, and then it schedules the
machine_check_exception handler to run when interrupts are enabled.

This works fine except the case of an unrecoverable MCE, where the true
NMI is taken when MSR[RI] is clear, it can not recover, so it calls
machine_check_exception directly so something might be done about it.

Calling an async handler from NMI context can result in irq state and
other things getting corrupted. This can also trigger the BUG at
  arch/powerpc/include/asm/interrupt.h:168

cxl/region: Fix null pointer dereference for resetting decoder

Not all decoders have a reset callback.

The CXL specification allows a host bridge with a single root port to
have no explicit HDM decoders. Currently the region driver assumes there
are none.  As such the CXL core creates a special pass through decoder
instance without a commit/reset callback.

Prior to this patch, the ->reset() callback was called unconditionally when
calling cxl_region_decode_reset. Thus a configuration with 1 Host Bridge,
1 Root Port, and one directly attached CXL type 3 device or multiple CXL
type 3 devices attached to downstream ports of a switch can cause a null
pointer dereference.

Before the fix, a kernel crash was observed when we destroy the region, and
a pass through decoder is reset.

The issue can be reproduced as below,
    1) create a region with a CXL setup which includes a HB with a
    single root port under which a memdev is attached directly.
    2) destroy the region with cxl destroy-region regionX -f."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

nilfs2: fix underflow in second superblock position calculations

Macro NILFS_SB2_OFFSET_BYTES, which computes the position of the second
superblock, underflows when the argument device size is less than 4096
bytes.  Therefore, when using this macro, it is necessary to check in
advance that the device size is not less than a lower limit, or at least
that underflow does not occur.

The current nilfs2 implementation lacks this check, causing out-of-bound
block access when mounting devices smaller than 4096 bytes:

 I/O error, dev loop0, sector 36028797018963960 op 0x0:(READ) flags 0x0
 phys_seg 1 prio class 2
 NILFS (loop0): unable to read secondary superblock (blocksize = 1024)

In addition, when trying to resize the filesystem to a size below 4096
bytes, this underflow occurs in nilfs_resize_fs(), passing a huge number
of segments to nilfs_sufile_resize(), corrupting parameters such as the
number of segments in superblocks.  This causes excessive loop iterations
in nilfs_sufile_resize() during a subsequent resize ioctl, causing
semaphore ns_segctor_sem to block for a long time and hang the writer
thread:

sched/psi: Fix use-after-free in ep_remove_wait_queue()

If a non-root cgroup gets removed when there is a thread that registered
trigger and is polling on a pressure file within the cgroup, the polling
waitqueue gets freed in the following path:

 do_rmdir
   cgroup_rmdir
     kernfs_drain_open_files
       cgroup_file_release
         cgroup_pressure_release
           psi_trigger_destroy

However, the polling thread still has a reference to the pressure file and
will access the freed waitqueue when the file is closed or upon exit:

 fput
   ep_eventpoll_release
     ep_free
       ep_remove_wait_queue
         remove_wait_queue

This results in use-after-free as pasted below.

The fundamental problem here is that cgroup_file_release() (and
consequently waitqueue's lifetime) is not tied to the file's real lifetime.
Using wake_up_pollfree() here might be less than ideal, but it is in line
with the comment at commit 42288cb44c4b (""wait: add wake_up_pollfree()"")
since the waitqueue's lifetime is not tied to file's one and can be
considered as another special case. While this would be fixable by somehow
making cgroup_file_release() be tied to the fput(), it would require
sizable refactoring at cgroups or higher layer which might be more
justifiable if we identify more cases like this.

fbdev: Fix invalid page access after closing deferred I/O devices

When a fbdev with deferred I/O is once opened and closed, the dirty
pages still remain queued in the pageref list, and eventually later
those may be processed in the delayed work.  This may lead to a
corruption of pages, hitting an Oops.

This patch makes sure to cancel the delayed work and clean up the

ALSA: hda: Do not unset preset when cleaning up codec

Several functions that take part in codec's initialization and removal
are re-used by ASoC codec drivers implementations. Drivers mimic the
behavior of hda_codec_driver_probe/remove() found in
sound/pci/hda/hda_bind.c with their component->probe/remove() instead.

One of the reasons for that is the expectation of
snd_hda_codec_device_new() to receive a valid pointer to an instance of
struct snd_card. This expectation can be met only once sound card
components probing commences.

As ASoC sound card may be unbound without codec device being actually
removed from the system, unsetting ->preset in
snd_hda_codec_cleanup_for_unbind() interferes with module unload -> load
scenario causing null-ptr-deref. Preset is assigned only once, during
device/driver matching whereas ASoC codec driver's module reloading may
occur several times throughout the lifetime of an audio stack."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Currently fiemap does not take the inode's lock (VFS lock), it only locks
a file range in the inode's io tree. This however can lead to a deadlock
if we have a concurrent fsync on the file and fiemap code triggers a fault
when accessing the user space buffer with fiemap_fill_next_extent(). The
deadlock happens on the inode's i_mmap_lock semaphore, which is taken both
by fsync and btrfs_page_mkwrite(). This deadlock was recently reported by
syzbot and triggers a trace like the following:

drm/amdgpu/fence: Fix oops due to non-matching drm_sched init/fini

Currently amdgpu calls drm_sched_fini() from the fence driver sw fini
routine - such function is expected to be called only after the
respective init function - drm_sched_init() - was executed successfully.

Happens that we faced a driver probe failure in the Steam Deck
recently, and the function drm_sched_fini() was called even without
its counter-part had been previously called, causing the following oops:

amdgpu: probe of 0000:04:00.0 failed with error -110

To prevent that, check if the drm_sched was properly initialized for a
given ring before calling its fini counter-part.

Notice ideally we'd use sched.ready for that; such field is set as the latest
thing on drm_sched_init(). But amdgpu seems to ""override"" the meaning of such
field - in the above oops for example, it was a GFX ring causing the crash, and
the sched.ready field was set to true in the ring init routine, regardless of
the state of the DRM scheduler. Hence, we ended-up using sched.ops as per
Christian's suggestion [0], and also removed the no_scheduler check [1].

Sometimes, it would also show up as corruption in the free list pointer
and cause crashes.

After bisecting the issue, we found the issue started from commit
e320d3012d25 (""mm/page_alloc.c: fix freeing non-compound pages""):

	if (put_page_testzero(page))
		free_the_page(page, order);
	else if (!PageHead(page))
		while (order-- > 0)
			free_the_page(page + (1 << order), order);

So the problem is the check PageHead is racy because at this point we
already dropped our reference to the page.  So even if we came in with
compound page, the page can already be freed and PageHead can return
false and we will end up freeing all the tail pages causing double free."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2023-52743	2024-05-21T16:15:14.157	2025-09-25T16:44:14.390	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: Do not use WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag for workqueue

When both ice and the irdma driver are loaded, a warning in
check_flush_dependency is being triggered. This is due to ice driver
workqueue being allocated with the WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag and the irdma one
is not.

According to kernel documentation, this flag should be set if the
workqueue will be involved in the kernel's memory reclamation flow.
Since it is not, there is no need for the ice driver's WQ to have this
flag set so remove it.

spi: Fix null dereference on suspend

A race condition exists where a synchronous (noqueue) transfer can be
active during a system suspend. This can cause a null pointer
dereference exception to occur when the system resumes.

Example order of events leading to the exception:
1. spi_sync() calls __spi_transfer_message_noqueue() which sets
   ctlr->cur_msg
2. Spi transfer begins via spi_transfer_one_message()
3. System is suspended interrupting the transfer context
4. System is resumed
6. spi_controller_resume() calls spi_start_queue() which resets cur_msg
   to NULL
7. Spi transfer context resumes and spi_finalize_current_message() is
   called which dereferences cur_msg (which is now NULL)

arm64: Restrict CPU_BIG_ENDIAN to GNU as or LLVM IAS 15.x or newer

Prior to LLVM 15.0.0, LLVM's integrated assembler would incorrectly
byte-swap NOP when compiling for big-endian, and the resulting series of
bytes happened to match the encoding of FNMADD S21, S30, S0, S0.

This went unnoticed until commit:

  34f66c4c4d5518c1 (""arm64: Use a positive cpucap for FP/SIMD"")

Prior to that commit, the kernel would always enable the use of FPSIMD
early in boot when __cpu_setup() initialized CPACR_EL1, and so usage of
FNMADD within the kernel was not detected, but could result in the
corruption of user or kernel FPSIMD state.

After that commit, the instructions happen to trap during boot prior to
FPSIMD being detected and enabled, e.g.

This is a race between open_cached_dir() and cached_dir_lease_break()
where the cache entry for the open directory handle receives a lease
break while creating it.  And before returning from open_cached_dir(),
we put the last reference of the new @cfid because of
!@cfid->has_lease.

Besides the UAF, while running xfstests a lot of missed lease breaks
have been noticed in tests that run several concurrent statfs(2) calls
on those cached fids

  CIFS: VFS: \\w22-root1.gandalf.test No task to wake, unknown frame...

To fix both, in open_cached_dir() ensure that @cfid->has_lease is set
right before sending out compounded request so that any potential
lease break will be get processed by demultiplex thread while we're
still caching @cfid.  And, if open failed for some reason, re-check
@cfid->has_lease to decide whether or not put lease reference."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

riscv: VMAP_STACK overflow detection thread-safe

commit 31da94c25aea (""riscv: add VMAP_STACK overflow detection"") added
support for CONFIG_VMAP_STACK. If overflow is detected, CPU switches to
`shadow_stack` temporarily before switching finally to per-cpu
`overflow_stack`.

If two CPUs/harts are racing and end up in over flowing kernel stack, one
or both will end up corrupting each other state because `shadow_stack` is
not per-cpu. This patch optimizes per-cpu overflow stack switch by
directly picking per-cpu `overflow_stack` and gets rid of `shadow_stack`.

Following are the changes in this patch

 - Defines an asm macro to obtain per-cpu symbols in destination
   register.
 - In entry.S, when overflow is detected, per-cpu overflow stack is
   located using per-cpu asm macro. Computing per-cpu symbol requires
   a temporary register. x31 is saved away into CSR_SCRATCH
   (CSR_SCRATCH is anyways zero since we're in kernel).

Please see Links for additional relevant disccussion and alternative
solution.

mfd: qcom-spmi-pmic: Fix revid implementation

The Qualcomm SPMI PMIC revid implementation is broken in multiple ways.

First, it assumes that just because the sibling base device has been
registered that means that it is also bound to a driver, which may not
be the case (e.g. due to probe deferral or asynchronous probe). This
could trigger a NULL-pointer dereference when attempting to access the
driver data of the unbound device.

Second, it accesses driver data of a sibling device directly and without
any locking, which means that the driver data may be freed while it is
being accessed (e.g. on driver unbind).

Third, it leaks a struct device reference to the sibling device which is
looked up using the spmi_device_from_of() every time a function (child)
device is calling the revid function (e.g. on probe).

Fix this mess by reimplementing the revid lookup so that it is done only
at probe of the PMIC device; the base device fetches the revid info from
the hardware, while any secondary SPMI device fetches the information
from the base device and caches it so that it can be accessed safely
from its children. If the base device has not been probed yet then probe
of a secondary device is deferred."	6.2	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

tls: fix NULL deref on tls_sw_splice_eof() with empty record

syzkaller discovered that if tls_sw_splice_eof() is executed as part of
sendfile() when the plaintext/ciphertext sk_msg are empty, the send path
gets confused because the empty ciphertext buffer does not have enough
space for the encryption overhead. This causes tls_push_record() to go on
the `split = true` path (which is only supposed to be used when interacting
with an attached BPF program), and then get further confused and hit the
tls_merge_open_record() path, which then assumes that there must be at
least one populated buffer element, leading to a NULL deref.

It is possible to have empty plaintext/ciphertext buffers if we previously
bailed from tls_sw_sendmsg_locked() via the tls_trim_both_msgs() path.

cxl/port: Fix delete_endpoint() vs parent unregistration race

The CXL subsystem, at cxl_mem ->probe() time, establishes a lineage of
ports (struct cxl_port objects) between an endpoint and the root of a
CXL topology. Each port including the endpoint port is attached to the
cxl_port driver.

Given that setup, it follows that when either any port in that lineage
goes through a cxl_port ->remove() event, or the memdev goes through a
cxl_mem ->remove() event. The hierarchy below the removed port, or the
entire hierarchy if the memdev is removed needs to come down.

The delete_endpoint() callback is careful to check whether it is being
called to tear down the hierarchy, or if it is only being called to
teardown the memdev because an ancestor port is going through
->remove().

That care needs to take the device_lock() of the endpoint's parent.
Which requires 2 bugs to be fixed:

1/ A reference on the parent is needed to prevent use-after-free
   scenarios like this signature:

In dasd_profile_start() the amount of requests on the device queue are

devices enabled, the device queue can change while dasd_profile_start()
is accessing the queue. In the worst case this leads to a kernel panic
due to incorrect pointer accesses.

counting the requests. Additionally the check for a valid profile data

net/smc: avoid data corruption caused by decline

We found a data corruption issue during testing of SMC-R on Redis
applications.

The benchmark has a low probability of reporting a strange error as
shown below.

""Error: Protocol error, got ""\xe2"" as reply type byte""

Finally, we found that the retrieved error data was as follows:

0xE2 0xD4 0xC3 0xD9 0x04 0x00 0x2C 0x20 0xA6 0x56 0x00 0x16 0x3E 0x0C

0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0xE2

It is quite obvious that this is a SMC DECLINE message, which means that
the applications received SMC protocol message.
We found that this was caused by the following situations:

client                  server
        ¦  clc proposal

        ¦  clc accept

        ¦   decline

        ¦   decline
        <--------------

As a result, a decline message was sent in the implementation, and this
message was read from TCP by the already-fallback connection.

This patch double the client timeout as 2x of the server value,
With this simple change, the Decline messages should never cross or
collide (during Confirm link timeout).

CVE-2023-52779	2024-05-21T16:15:16.890	2025-04-02T15:02:51.383	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs: Pass AT_GETATTR_NOSEC flag to getattr interface function

When vfs_getattr_nosec() calls a filesystem's getattr interface function
then the 'nosec' should propagate into this function so that
vfs_getattr_nosec() can again be called from the filesystem's gettattr
rather than vfs_getattr(). The latter would add unnecessary security
checks that the initial vfs_getattr_nosec() call wanted to avoid.
Therefore, introduce the getattr flag GETATTR_NOSEC and allow to pass
with the new getattr_flags parameter to the getattr interface function.
In overlayfs and ecryptfs use this flag to determine which one of the
two functions to call.

In a recent code change introduced to IMA vfs_getattr_nosec() ended up
calling vfs_getattr() in overlayfs, which in turn called
security_inode_getattr() on an exiting process that did not have
current->fs set anymore, which then caused a kernel NULL pointer
dereference. With this change the call to security_inode_getattr() can
be avoided, thus avoiding the NULL pointer dereference."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

bonding: stop the device in bond_setup_by_slave()

Commit 9eed321cde22 (""net: lapbether: only support ethernet devices"")
has been able to keep syzbot away from net/lapb, until today.

In the following splat [1], the issue is that a lapbether device has
been created on a bonding device without members. Then adding a non
ARPHRD_ETHER member forced the bonding master to change its type.

The fix is to make sure we call dev_close() in bond_setup_by_slave()
so that the potential linked lapbether devices (or any other devices
having assumptions on the physical device) are removed.

A similar bug has been addressed in commit 40baec225765

ext4: fix racy may inline data check in dio write

syzbot reports that the following warning from ext4_iomap_begin()
triggers as of the commit referenced below:

        if (WARN_ON_ONCE(ext4_has_inline_data(inode)))
                return -ERANGE;

This occurs during a dio write, which is never expected to encounter
an inode with inline data. To enforce this behavior,
ext4_dio_write_iter() checks the current inline state of the inode
and clears the MAY_INLINE_DATA state flag to either fall back to
buffered writes, or enforce that any other writers in progress on
the inode are not allowed to create inline data.

The problem is that the check for existing inline data and the state
flag can span a lock cycle. For example, if the ilock is originally
locked shared and subsequently upgraded to exclusive, another writer
may have reacquired the lock and created inline data before the dio
write task acquires the lock and proceeds.

The commit referenced below loosens the lock requirements to allow
some forms of unaligned dio writes to occur under shared lock, but
AFAICT the inline data check was technically already racy for any
dio write that would have involved a lock cycle. Regardless, lift
clearing of the state bit to the same lock critical section that
checks for preexisting inline data on the inode to close the race."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

cxl/region: Do not try to cleanup after cxl_region_setup_targets() fails

Commit 5e42bcbc3fef (""cxl/region: decrement ->nr_targets on error in
cxl_region_attach()"") tried to avoid 'eiw' initialization errors when
->nr_targets exceeded 16, by just decrementing ->nr_targets when
cxl_region_setup_targets() failed.

Commit 86987c766276 (""cxl/region: Cleanup target list on attach error"")
extended that cleanup to also clear cxled->pos and p->targets[pos]. The
initialization error was incidentally fixed separately by:
Commit 8d4285425714 (""cxl/region: Fix port setup uninitialized variable
warnings"") which was merged a few days after 5e42bcbc3fef.

But now the original cleanup when cxl_region_setup_targets() fails
prevents endpoint and switch decoder resources from being reused:

1) the cleanup does not set the decoder's region to NULL, which results
   in future dpa_size_store() calls returning -EBUSY
2) the decoder is not properly freed, which results in future commit
   errors associated with the upstream switch

Now that the initialization errors were fixed separately, the proper
cleanup for this case is to just return immediately. Then the resources
associated with this target get cleanup up as normal when the failed
region is deleted.

The ->nr_targets decrement in the error case also helped prevent
a p->targets[] array overflow, so add a new check to prevent against
that overflow.

Tested by trying to create an invalid region for a 2 switch * 2 endpoint
topology, and then following up with creating a valid region."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

SUNRPC: Fix RPC client cleaned up the freed pipefs dentries

RPC client pipefs dentries cleanup is in separated rpc_remove_pipedir()
workqueue,which takes care about pipefs superblock locking.
In some special scenarios, when kernel frees the pipefs sb of the
current client and immediately alloctes a new pipefs sb,
rpc_remove_pipedir function would misjudge the existence of pipefs
sb which is not the one it used to hold. As a result,
the rpc_remove_pipedir would clean the released freed pipefs dentries.

To fix this issue, rpc_remove_pipedir should check whether the
current pipefs sb is consistent with the original pipefs sb.

 Kernel panic - not syncing: hung_task: blocked tasks

For padata_do_parallel, when the return err is 0 or -EBUSY, it will call
wait_for_completion(&wait->completion) in test_aead_vec_cfg. In normal
case, aead_request_complete() will be called in pcrypt_aead_serial and the
return err is 0 for padata_do_parallel. But, when pinst->flags is
PADATA_RESET, the return err is -EBUSY for padata_do_parallel, and it
won't call aead_request_complete(). Therefore, test_aead_vec_cfg will
hung at wait_for_completion(&wait->completion), which will cause
hungtask.

The problem comes as following:
(padata_do_parallel)                 |
    rcu_read_lock_bh();              |
    err = -EINVAL;                   |   (padata_replace)

    if (pinst->flags & PADATA_RESET) |
        rcu_read_unlock_bh()         |
        return err

In order to resolve the problem, we replace the return err -EBUSY with
-EAGAIN, which means parallel_data is changing, and the caller should call
it again.

v3:
remove retry and just change the return err.
v2:
introduce padata_try_do_parallel() in pcrypt_aead_encrypt and

bpf: Detect IP == ksym.end as part of BPF program

Now that bpf_throw kfunc is the first such call instruction that has
noreturn semantics within the verifier, this also kicks in dead code
elimination in unprecedented ways. For one, any instruction following
a bpf_throw call will never be marked as seen. Moreover, if a callchain
ends up throwing, any instructions after the call instruction to the
eventually throwing subprog in callers will also never be marked as
seen.

The tempting way to fix this would be to emit extra 'int3' instructions
which bump the jited_len of a program, and ensure that during runtime
when a program throws, we can discover its boundaries even if the call
instruction to bpf_throw (or to subprogs that always throw) is emitted
as the final instruction in the program.

An example of such a program would be this:

do_something():
	...
	r0 = 0
	exit

foo():
	r1 = 0
	call bpf_throw
	r0 = 0
	exit

bar(cond):
	if r1 != 0 goto pc+2
	call do_something
	exit
	call foo
	r0 = 0  // Never seen by verifier
	exit	//

main(ctx):
	r1 = ...
	call bar
	r0 = 0
	exit

Here, if we do end up throwing, the stacktrace would be the following:

bpf_throw
foo
bar
main

In bar, the final instruction emitted will be the call to foo, as such,
the return address will be the subsequent instruction (which the JIT
emits as int3 on x86). This will end up lying outside the jited_len of
the program, thus, when unwinding, we will fail to discover the return
address as belonging to any program and end up in a panic due to the
unreliable stack unwinding of BPF programs that we never expect.

To remedy this case, make bpf_prog_ksym_find treat IP == ksym.end as
part of the BPF program, so that is_bpf_text_address returns true when
such a case occurs, and we are able to unwind reliably when the final
instruction ends up being a call instruction."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

This is based on alx driver commit 881d0327db37 (""net: alx: Work around

The alx and atl1c drivers had RX overflow error which was why a custom
allocator was created to avoid certain addresses. The simpler workaround
then created for alx driver, but not for atl1c due to lack of tester.

Instead of using a custom allocator, check the allocated skb address and

locking/ww_mutex/test: Fix potential workqueue corruption

In some cases running with the test-ww_mutex code, I was seeing
odd behavior where sometimes it seemed flush_workqueue was
returning before all the work threads were finished.

Often this would cause strange crashes as the mutexes would be
freed while they were being used.

Looking at the code, there is a lifetime problem as the
controlling thread that spawns the work allocates the
""struct stress"" structures that are passed to the workqueue
threads. Then when the workqueue threads are finished,
they free the stress struct that was passed to them.

Unfortunately the workqueue work_struct node is in the stress
struct. Which means the work_struct is freed before the work
thread returns and while flush_workqueue is waiting.

It seems like a better idea to have the controlling thread
both allocate and free the stress structures, so that we can
be sure we don't corrupt the workqueue by freeing the structure
prematurely.

So this patch reworks the test to do so, and with this change
I no longer see the early flush_workqueue returns."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Add a mac_len test before all three eth_hdr(skb) calls under net/llc.

There are further uses in include/net/llc_pdu.h. All these are
protected by a test skb->protocol == ETH_P_802_2. Which does not
protect against this tun scenario.

But the mac_len test added in this patch in llc_fixup_skb will
indirectly protect those too. That is called from llc_rcv before any
other LLC code.

It is tempting to just add a blanket mac_len check in llc_rcv, but
not sure whether that could break valid LLC paths that do not assume
an Ethernet header. 802.2 LLC may be used on top of non-802.3
protocols in principle. The below referenced commit shows that used
to, on top of Token Ring.

At least one of the three eth_hdr uses goes back to before the start
of git history. But the one that syzbot exercises is introduced in
this commit. That commit is old enough (2008), that effectively all
stable kernels should receive this."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

TIPC bearer-related names including link names must be null-terminated
strings. If a link name which is not null-terminated is passed through
netlink, strstr() and similar functions can cause buffer overrun. This
causes the above issue.

This patch changes the nla_policy for bearer-related names from NLA_STRING
to NLA_NUL_STRING. This resolves the issue by ensuring that only
null-terminated strings are accepted as bearer-related names.

syzbot reported similar uninit-value issue related to bearer names [2]. The
root cause of this issue is that a non-null-terminated bearer name was
passed. This patch also resolved this issue."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

padata: Fix refcnt handling in padata_free_shell()

In a high-load arm64 environment, the pcrypt_aead01 test in LTP can lead
to system UAF (Use-After-Free) issues. Due to the lengthy analysis of
the pcrypt_aead01 function call, I'll describe the problem scenario
using a simplified model:

Suppose there's a user of padata named `user_function` that adheres to
the padata requirement of calling `padata_free_shell` after `serial()`
has been invoked, as demonstrated in the following code:

```c
struct request {
    struct padata_priv padata;
    struct completion *done;
};

void parallel(struct padata_priv *padata) {
    do_something();
}

void serial(struct padata_priv *padata) {
    struct request *request = container_of(padata,
    				struct request,
				padata);
    complete(request->done);
}

void user_function() {
    DECLARE_COMPLETION(done)
    padata->parallel = parallel;
    padata->serial = serial;
    padata_do_parallel();
    wait_for_completion(&done);
    padata_free_shell();
}
```

In the corresponding padata.c file, there's the following code:

```c
static void padata_serial_worker(struct work_struct *serial_work) {
    ...
    cnt = 0;

    while (!list_empty(&local_list)) {
        ...
        padata->serial(padata);
        cnt++;
    }

    local_bh_enable();

    if (refcount_sub_and_test(cnt, &pd->refcnt))
        padata_free_pd(pd);
}
```

Because of the high system load and the accumulation of unexecuted
softirq at this moment, `local_bh_enable()` in padata takes longer
to execute than usual. Subsequently, when accessing `pd->refcnt`,
`pd` has already been released by `padata_free_shell()`, resulting
in a UAF issue with `pd->refcnt`.

The fix is straightforward: add `refcount_dec_and_test` before calling
`padata_free_pd` in `padata_free_shell`."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

explicitly registered with drm_connector_register(), which is not the
case in lt8912b.

The driver's drm_connector_funcs.destroy hook is set to
drm_connector_cleanup().

Thus the driver should not call either drm_connector_unregister() nor
drm_connector_cleanup() in its lt8912_bridge_detach(), as they cause a
crash on bridge detach:

HID: uclogic: Fix user-memory-access bug in uclogic_params_ugee_v2_init_event_hooks()

When CONFIG_HID_UCLOGIC=y and CONFIG_KUNIT_ALL_TESTS=y, launch kernel and
then the below user-memory-access bug occurs.

In hid_test_uclogic_params_cleanup_event_hooks(),it call
uclogic_params_ugee_v2_init_event_hooks() with the first arg=NULL, so
when it calls uclogic_params_ugee_v2_has_battery(), the hid_get_drvdata()
will access hdev->dev with hdev=NULL, which will cause below
user-memory-access.

So add a fake_device with quirks member and call hid_set_drvdata()
to assign hdev->dev->driver_data which avoids the null-ptr-def bug
for drvdata->quirks in uclogic_params_ugee_v2_has_battery(). After applying
this patch, the below user-memory-access bug never occurs.

x86/tdx: Zero out the missing RSI in TDX_HYPERCALL macro

In the TDX_HYPERCALL asm, after the TDCALL instruction returns from the
untrusted VMM, the registers that the TDX guest shares to the VMM need
to be cleared to avoid speculative execution of VMM-provided values.

RSI is specified in the bitmap of those registers, but it is missing
when zeroing out those registers in the current TDX_HYPERCALL.

It was there when it was originally added in commit 752d13305c78
(""x86/tdx: Expand __tdx_hypercall() to handle more arguments""), but was
later removed in commit 1e70c680375a (""x86/tdx: Do not corrupt
frame-pointer in __tdx_hypercall()""), which was correct because %rsi is
later restored in the ""pop %rsi"".  However a later commit 7a3a401874be
(""x86/tdx: Drop flags from __tdx_hypercall()"") removed that ""pop %rsi""
but forgot to add the ""xor %rsi, %rsi"" back.

 CPU: 6 PID: 877 Comm: bash Not tainted 6.5.0-rc4-test-00008-g2c6b6b1029d4-dirty #186
 Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 1.16.2-debian-1.16.2-1 04/01/2014
 RIP: 0010:tracing_release_file_tr+0xc/0x50

What happens here is that the kprobe event creates a trace_event_file
""file"" descriptor that represents the file in tracefs to the event. It
maintains state of the event (is it enabled for the given instance?).
Opening the ""enable"" file gets a reference to the event ""file"" descriptor
via the open file descriptor. When the kprobe event is deleted, the file is
also deleted from the tracefs system which also frees the event ""file""
descriptor.

But as the tracefs file is still opened by user space, it will not be
totally removed until the final dput() is called on it. But this is not
true with the event ""file"" descriptor that is already freed. If the user
does a write to or simply closes the file descriptor it will reference the
event ""file"" descriptor that was just freed, causing a use-after-free bug.

To solve this, add a ref count to the event ""file"" descriptor as well as a
new flag called ""FREED"". The ""file"" will not be freed until the last
reference is released. But the FREE flag will be set when the event is
removed to prevent any more modifications to that event from happening,
even if there's still a reference to the event ""file"" descriptor."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Error injection testing uncovered a case where we'd end up with a

occurs because the if statement to decide if we should abort is wrong.

The only way we would abort in this case is if we got a ret !=
-EOPNOTSUPP and we called from the file clone code.  However the
prealloc code uses this path too.  Instead we need to abort if there is
an error, and the only error we _don't_ abort on is -EOPNOTSUPP and only

xhci: Fix command ring pointer corruption while aborting a command

The command ring pointer is located at [6:63] bits of the command
ring control register (CRCR). All the control bits like command stop,
abort are located at [0:3] bits. While aborting a command, we read the
CRCR and set the abort bit and write to the CRCR. The read will always
give command ring pointer as all zeros. So we essentially write only
the control bits. Since we split the 64 bit write into two 32 bit writes,
there is a possibility of xHC command ring stopped before the upper
dword (all zeros) is written. If that happens, xHC updates the upper
dword of its internal command ring pointer with all zeros. Next time,
when the command ring is restarted, we see xHC memory access failures.
Fix this issue by only writing to the lower dword of CRCR where all
control bits are located."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

usb: musb: dsps: Fix the probe error path

Commit 7c75bde329d7 (""usb: musb: musb_dsps: request_irq() after
initializing musb"") has inverted the calls to
dsps_setup_optional_vbus_irq() and dsps_create_musb_pdev() without
updating correctly the error path. dsps_create_musb_pdev() allocates and
registers a new platform device which must be unregistered and freed
with platform_device_unregister(), and this is missing upon
dsps_setup_optional_vbus_irq() error.

While on the master branch it seems not to trigger any issue, I observed
a kernel crash because of a NULL pointer dereference with a v5.10.70
stable kernel where the patch mentioned above was backported. With this
kernel version, -EPROBE_DEFER is returned the first time
dsps_setup_optional_vbus_irq() is called which triggers the probe to
error out without unregistering the platform device. Unfortunately, on
the Beagle Bone Black Wireless, the platform device still living in the
system is being used by the USB Ethernet gadget driver, which during the
boot phase triggers the crash.

My limited knowledge of the musb world prevents me to revert this commit
which was sent to silence a robot warning which, as far as I understand,
does not make sense. The goal of this patch was to prevent an IRQ to
fire before the platform device being registered. I think this cannot
ever happen due to the fact that enabling the interrupts is done by the
->enable() callback of the platform musb device, and this platform
device must be already registered in order for the core or any other
user to use this callback.

Hence, I decided to fix the error path, which might prevent future
errors on mainline kernels while also fixing older ones."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

net: dsa: microchip: Added the condition for scheduling ksz_mib_read_work

When the ksz module is installed and removed using rmmod, kernel crashes
with null pointer dereferrence error. During rmmod, ksz_switch_remove
function tries to cancel the mib_read_workqueue using
cancel_delayed_work_sync routine and unregister switch from dsa.

During dsa_unregister_switch it calls ksz_mac_link_down, which in turn
reschedules the workqueue since mib_interval is non-zero.
Due to which queue executed after mib_interval and it tries to access
dp->slave. But the slave is unregistered in the ksz_switch_remove
function. Hence kernel crashes.

To avoid this crash, before canceling the workqueue, resetted the
mib_interval to 0.

CVE-2021-47441	2024-05-22T07:15:09.340	2025-04-02T15:12:50.463	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mlxsw: thermal: Fix out-of-bounds memory accesses

Currently, mlxsw allows cooling states to be set above the maximum
cooling state supported by the driver:

 # cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/cdev0/type
 mlxsw_fan
 # cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/cdev0/max_state
 10
 # echo 18 > /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/cdev0/cur_state
 # echo $?
 0

This results in out-of-bounds memory accesses when thermal state
transition statistics are enabled (CONFIG_THERMAL_STATISTICS=y), as the
transition table is accessed with a too large index (state) [1].

According to the thermal maintainer, it is the responsibility of the
driver to reject such operations [2].

Therefore, return an error when the state to be set exceeds the maximum
cooling state supported by the driver.

To avoid dead code, as suggested by the thermal maintainer [3],
partially revert commit a421ce088ac8 (""mlxsw: core: Extend cooling
device with cooling levels"") that tried to interpret these invalid
cooling states (above the maximum) in a special way. The cooling levels
array is not removed in order to prevent the fans going below 20% PWM,
which would cause them to get stuck at 0% PWM.

drm/edid: In connector_bad_edid() cap num_of_ext by num_blocks read

In commit e11f5bd8228f (""drm: Add support for DP 1.4 Compliance edid
corruption test"") the function connector_bad_edid() started assuming
that the memory for the EDID passed to it was big enough to hold
`edid[0x7e] + 1` blocks of data (1 extra for the base block). It
completely ignored the fact that the function was passed `num_blocks`
which indicated how much memory had been allocated for the EDID.

Let's fix this by adding a bounds check.

This is important for handling the case where there's an error in the
first block of the EDID. In that case we will call
connector_bad_edid() without having re-allocated memory based on

CVE-2021-47449	2024-05-22T07:15:10.050	2025-04-02T15:12:07.153	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: fix locking for Tx timestamp tracking flush

Commit 4dd0d5c33c3e (""ice: add lock around Tx timestamp tracker flush"")
added a lock around the Tx timestamp tracker flow which is used to
cleanup any left over SKBs and prepare for device removal.

This lock is problematic because it is being held around a call to
ice_clear_phy_tstamp. The clear function takes a mutex to send a PHY
write command to firmware. This could lead to a deadlock if the mutex
actually sleeps, and causes the following warning on a kernel with
preemption debugging enabled:

The KVM page-table library refcounts the pages of concatenated stage-2

host's stage-2 PGD is currently managed by EL2 as a single high-order
compound page, which can cause the refcount of the tail pages to reach 0
when they shouldn't, hence corrupting the page-table.

Fix this by introducing a new hyp_split_page() helper in the EL2 page

netfilter: xt_IDLETIMER: fix panic that occurs when timer_type has garbage value

Currently, when the rule related to IDLETIMER is added, idletimer_tg timer
structure is initialized by kmalloc on executing idletimer_tg_create
function. However, in this process timer->timer_type is not defined to
a specific value. Thus, timer->timer_type has garbage value and it occurs
kernel panic. So, this commit fixes the panic by initializing
timer->timer_type using kzalloc instead of kmalloc.

In the remove path, there is an attempt to free the aux_idx IDA whether

But, this free cannot be gated by the status bit for RDMA, since it is

driver can enter into a state where RDMA is not supported after the IDA

ocfs2: fix data corruption after conversion from inline format

Commit 6dbf7bb55598 (""fs: Don't invalidate page buffers in
block_write_full_page()"") uncovered a latent bug in ocfs2 conversion
from inline inode format to a normal inode format.

The code in ocfs2_convert_inline_data_to_extents() attempts to zero out
the whole cluster allocated for file data by grabbing, zeroing, and
dirtying all pages covering this cluster.  However these pages are
beyond i_size, thus writeback code generally ignores these dirty pages
and no blocks were ever actually zeroed on the disk.

This oversight was fixed by commit 693c241a5f6a (""ocfs2: No need to zero
pages past i_size."") for standard ocfs2 write path, inline conversion
path was apparently forgotten; the commit log also has a reasoning why
the zeroing actually is not needed.

After commit 6dbf7bb55598, things became worse as writeback code stopped
invalidating buffers on pages beyond i_size and thus these pages end up
with clean PageDirty bit but with buffers attached to these pages being
still dirty.  So when a file is converted from inline format, then
writeback triggers, and then the file is grown so that these pages
become valid, the invalid dirtiness state is preserved,
mark_buffer_dirty() does nothing on these pages (buffers are already
dirty) but page is never written back because it is clean.  So data
written to these pages is lost once pages are reclaimed.

Simple reproducer for the problem is:

  xfs_io -f -c ""pwrite 0 2000"" -c ""pwrite 2000 2000"" -c ""fsync"" \
    -c ""pwrite 4000 2000"" ocfs2_file

After unmounting and mounting the fs again, you can observe that end of
'ocfs2_file' has lost its contents.

Fix the problem by not doing the pointless zeroing during conversion
from inline format similarly as in the standard write path.

KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix stack handling in idle_kvm_start_guest()

In commit 10d91611f426 (""powerpc/64s: Reimplement book3s idle code in
C"") kvm_start_guest() became idle_kvm_start_guest(). The old code
allocated a stack frame on the emergency stack, but didn't use the
frame to store anything, and also didn't store anything in its caller's
frame.

idle_kvm_start_guest() on the other hand is written more like a normal C
function, it creates a frame on entry, and also stores CR/LR into its
callers frame (per the ABI). The problem is that there is no caller
frame on the emergency stack.

The emergency stack for a given CPU is allocated with:

  paca_ptrs[i]->emergency_sp = alloc_stack(limit, i) + THREAD_SIZE;

So emergency_sp actually points to the first address above the emergency
stack allocation for a given CPU, we must not store above it without
first decrementing it to create a frame. This is different to the
regular kernel stack, paca->kstack, which is initialised to point at an
initial frame that is ready to use.

idle_kvm_start_guest() stores the backchain, CR and LR all of which
write outside the allocation for the emergency stack. It then creates a
stack frame and saves the non-volatile registers. Unfortunately the
frame it creates is not large enough to fit the non-volatiles, and so
the saving of the non-volatile registers also writes outside the
emergency stack allocation.

The end result is that we corrupt whatever is at 0-24 bytes, and 112-248
bytes above the emergency stack allocation.

In practice this has gone unnoticed because the memory immediately above
the emergency stack happens to be used for other stack allocations,
either another CPUs mc_emergency_sp or an IRQ stack. See the order of
calls to irqstack_early_init() and emergency_stack_init().

The low addresses of another stack are the top of that stack, and so are
only used if that stack is under extreme pressue, which essentially
never happens in practice - and if it did there's a high likelyhood we'd
crash due to that stack overflowing.

Still, we shouldn't be corrupting someone else's stack, and it is purely
luck that we aren't corrupting something else.

To fix it we save CR/LR into the caller's frame using the existing r1 on
entry, we then create a SWITCH_FRAME_SIZE frame (which has space for
pt_regs) on the emergency stack with the backchain pointing to the
existing stack, and then finally we switch to the new frame on the
emergency stack."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

net: batman-adv: fix error handling

Syzbot reported ODEBUG warning in batadv_nc_mesh_free(). The problem was
in wrong error handling in batadv_mesh_init().

Before this patch batadv_mesh_init() was calling batadv_mesh_free() in case
of any batadv_*_init() calls failure. This approach may work well, when
there is some kind of indicator, which can tell which parts of batadv are
initialized; but there isn't any.

All written above lead to cleaning up uninitialized fields. Even if we hide
ODEBUG warning by initializing bat_priv->nc.work, syzbot was able to hit
GPF in batadv_nc_purge_paths(), because hash pointer in still NULL. [1]

To fix these bugs we can unwind batadv_*_init() calls one by one.
It is good approach for 2 reasons: 1) It fixes bugs on error handling
path 2) It improves the performance, since we won't call unneeded
batadv_*_free() functions.

So, this patch makes all batadv_*_init() clean up all allocated memory
before returning with an error to no call correspoing batadv_*_free()
and open-codes batadv_mesh_free() with proper order to avoid touching
uninitialized fields."	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-20261	2024-05-22T17:16:12.873	2025-07-30T19:11:18.480	A vulnerability in the file policy feature that is used to inspect encrypted archive files of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured file policy to block an encrypted archive file. This vulnerability exists because of a logic error when a specific class of encrypted archive files is inspected. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted, encrypted archive file through the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send an encrypted archive file, which could contain malware and should have been blocked and dropped at the Cisco FTD device.	5.8	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N		
CVE-2024-20293	2024-05-22T17:16:13.167	2025-07-30T19:06:02.740	A vulnerability in the activation of an access control list (ACL) on Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the protection that is offered by a configured ACL on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to a logic error that occurs when an ACL changes from inactive to active in the running configuration of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic through the affected device that should be denied by the configured ACL. The reverse condition is also true—traffic that should be permitted could be denied by the configured ACL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured ACL protections on the affected device, allowing the attacker to access trusted networks that the device might be protecting. Note: This vulnerability applies to both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic as well as dual-stack ACL configurations in which both IPv4 and IPv6 ACLs are configured on an interface.	5.8	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N		
CVE-2024-20355	2024-05-22T17:16:13.477	2025-07-30T19:04:55.030	A vulnerability in the implementation of SAML 2.0 single sign-on (SSO) for remote access VPN services in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to successfully establish a VPN session on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper separation of authorization domains when using SAML authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using valid credentials to successfully authenticate using their designated connection profile (tunnel group), intercepting the SAML SSO token that is sent back from the Cisco ASA device, and then submitting the same SAML SSO token to a different tunnel group for authentication. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to establish a remote access VPN session using a connection profile that they are not authorized to use and connect to secured networks behind the affected device that they are not authorized to access. For successful exploitation, the attacker must have valid remote access VPN user credentials.	5.0	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N		
CVE-2024-20361	2024-05-22T17:16:13.733	2025-08-07T17:08:51.217	A vulnerability in the Object Groups for Access Control Lists (ACLs) feature of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured access controls on managed devices that are running Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software.

Extend a critical section to prevent chan from early freeing.
Also make the l2cap_connect() return type void. Nothing is using the
returned value but it is ugly to return a potentially freed pointer.
Making it void will help with backports because earlier kernels did use
the return value. Now the compile will break for kernels where this
patch is not a complete fix.

aio: fix use-after-free due to missing POLLFREE handling

signalfd_poll() and binder_poll() are special in that they use a
waitqueue whose lifetime is the current task, rather than the struct
file as is normally the case.  This is okay for blocking polls, since a
blocking poll occurs within one task; however, non-blocking polls
require another solution.  This solution is for the queue to be cleared
before it is freed, by sending a POLLFREE notification to all waiters.

Unfortunately, only eventpoll handles POLLFREE.  A second type of
non-blocking poll, aio poll, was added in kernel v4.18, and it doesn't
handle POLLFREE.  This allows a use-after-free to occur if a signalfd or
binder fd is polled with aio poll, and the waitqueue gets freed.

Fix this by making aio poll handle POLLFREE.

A patch by Ramji Jiyani <ramjiyani@google.com>
(https://lore.kernel.org/r/20211027011834.2497484-1-ramjiyani@google.com)
tried to do this by making aio_poll_wake() always complete the request
inline if POLLFREE is seen.  However, that solution had two bugs.
First, it introduced a deadlock, as it unconditionally locked the aio
context while holding the waitqueue lock, which inverts the normal
locking order.  Second, it didn't consider that POLLFREE notifications
are missed while the request has been temporarily de-queued.

The second problem was solved by my previous patch.  This patch then
properly fixes the use-after-free by handling POLLFREE in a
deadlock-free way.  It does this by taking advantage of the fact that
freeing of the waitqueue is RCU-delayed, similar to what eventpoll does."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

A delegation break could arrive as soon as we've called vfs_setlease.  A

then exit nfs4_set_delegation without hashing the delegation, it will be

Symptoms show up later as use-after-free or list corruption warnings,

In case brtfs_qgroup_reserve_data() or btrfs_delalloc_reserve_metadata()

So in btrfs_check_data_free_space() and btrfs_delalloc_reserve_space()
free the allocated extent_changeset to get rid of the allocated memory.

after 65b3c08606e5 (""btrfs: fix ENOSPC failure when attempting direct IO

The abort occurs because of a write hole while writing out freeing tree
nodes of a tree-log tree. For zoned btrfs, we re-dirty a freed tree
node to ensure btrfs can write the region and does not leave a hole on
write on a zoned device. The current code fails to re-dirty a node
when the tree-log tree's depth is greater or equal to 2. That leads to
a transaction abort with -EAGAIN.

Fix the issue by properly re-dirtying a node on walking up the tree."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

seg6: fix the iif in the IPv6 socket control block

When an IPv4 packet is received, the ip_rcv_core(...) sets the receiving
interface index into the IPv4 socket control block (v5.16-rc4,
net/ipv4/ip_input.c line 510):

    IPCB(skb)->iif = skb->skb_iif;

If that IPv4 packet is meant to be encapsulated in an outer IPv6+SRH
header, the seg6_do_srh_encap(...) performs the required encapsulation.
In this case, the seg6_do_srh_encap function clears the IPv6 socket control
block (v5.16-rc4 net/ipv6/seg6_iptunnel.c line 163):

    memset(IP6CB(skb), 0, sizeof(*IP6CB(skb)));

The memset(...) was introduced in commit ef489749aae5 (""ipv6: sr: clear
IP6CB(skb) on SRH ip4ip6 encapsulation"") a long time ago (2019-01-29).

Since the IPv6 socket control block and the IPv4 socket control block share
the same memory area (skb->cb), the receiving interface index info is lost
(IP6CB(skb)->iif is set to zero).

As a side effect, that condition triggers a NULL pointer dereference if
commit 0857d6f8c759 (""ipv6: When forwarding count rx stats on the orig
netdev"") is applied.

To fix that issue, we set the IP6CB(skb)->iif with the index of the
receiving interface once again."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

There is a short period between a net device starts to be unregistered

Do not allow ethtool operations after a net device starts its
unregistration. This patch targets the netlink part as the ioctl one

operation is executed within an rtnl lock section and the net device
won't be found after unregister.

Not freeing the transmit buffer means that the buffer is no longer

end up being transmitted in case tx is restarted.

Furthermore, the buffer of any port that has been opened would leak on

the ldisc race worked around by commit a5ba1d95e46e (""uart: fix race

drm/msm: Fix mmap to include VM_IO and VM_DONTDUMP

In commit 510410bfc034 (""drm/msm: Implement mmap as GEM object
function"") we switched to a new/cleaner method of doing things. That's
good, but we missed a little bit.

Before that commit, we used to _first_ run through the
drm_gem_mmap_obj() case where `obj->funcs->mmap()` was NULL. That meant
that we ran:

  vma->vm_flags |= VM_IO | VM_PFNMAP | VM_DONTEXPAND | VM_DONTDUMP;
  vma->vm_page_prot = pgprot_writecombine(vm_get_page_prot(vma->vm_flags));
  vma->vm_page_prot = pgprot_decrypted(vma->vm_page_prot);

...and _then_ we modified those mappings with our own. Now that
`obj->funcs->mmap()` is no longer NULL we don't run the default
code. It looks like the fact that the vm_flags got VM_IO / VM_DONTDUMP
was important because we're now getting crashes on Chromebooks that
use ARC++ while logging out. Specifically a crash that looks like this
(this is on a 5.10 kernel w/ relevant backports but also seen on a
5.15 kernel):

Let's add the two flags back in.

While we're at it, the fact that we aren't running the default means
that we _don't_ need to clear out VM_PFNMAP, so remove that and save
an instruction.

tcp: fix page frag corruption on page fault

Steffen reported a TCP stream corruption for HTTP requests
served by the apache web-server using a cifs mount-point
and memory mapping the relevant file.

The root cause is quite similar to the one addressed by
commit 20eb4f29b602 (""net: fix sk_page_frag() recursion from
memory reclaim""). Here the nested access to the task page frag
is caused by a page fault on the (mmapped) user-space memory
buffer coming from the cifs file.

The page fault handler performs an smb transaction on a different
socket, inside the same process context. Since sk->sk_allaction
for such socket does not prevent the usage for the task_frag,
the nested allocation modify ""under the hood"" the page frag
in use by the outer sendmsg call, corrupting the stream.

ipv6: fix memory leak in fib6_rule_suppress

The kernel leaks memory when a `fib` rule is present in IPv6 nftables
firewall rules and a suppress_prefix rule is present in the IPv6 routing
rules (used by certain tools such as wg-quick). In such scenarios, every
incoming packet will leak an allocation in `ip6_dst_cache` slab cache.

After some hours of `bpftrace`-ing and source code reading, I tracked
down the issue to ca7a03c41753 (""ipv6: do not free rt if
FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF is set on suppress rule"").

The problem with that change is that the generic `args->flags` always have
`FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF` set[1][2] but the IPv6-specific flag
`RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF` might not be, leading to `fib6_rule_suppress` not
decreasing the refcount when needed.

How to reproduce:
 - Add the following nftables rule to a prerouting chain:
     meta nfproto ipv6 fib saddr . mark . iif oif missing drop
   This can be done with:
     sudo nft create table inet test
     sudo nft create chain inet test test_chain '{ type filter hook prerouting priority filter + 10; policy accept; }'
     sudo nft add rule inet test test_chain meta nfproto ipv6 fib saddr . mark . iif oif missing drop
 - Run:
     sudo ip -6 rule add table main suppress_prefixlength 0
 - Watch `sudo slabtop -o | grep ip6_dst_cache` to see memory usage increase
   with every incoming ipv6 packet.

This patch exposes the protocol-specific flags to the protocol
specific `suppress` function, and check the protocol-specific `flags`
argument for RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF instead of the generic
FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF when decreasing the refcount, like this.

blk-mq: cancel blk-mq dispatch work in both blk_cleanup_queue and disk_release()

For avoiding to slow down queue destroy, we don't call
blk_mq_quiesce_queue() in blk_cleanup_queue(), instead of delaying to
cancel dispatch work in blk_release_queue().

However, this way has caused kernel oops[1], reported by Changhui. The log
shows that scsi_device can be freed before running blk_release_queue(),
which is expected too since scsi_device is released after the scsi disk
is closed and the scsi_device is removed.

Fixes the issue by canceling blk-mq dispatch work in both blk_cleanup_queue()
and disk_release():

1) when disk_release() is run, the disk has been closed, and any sync
dispatch activities have been done, so canceling dispatch work is enough to
quiesce filesystem I/O dispatch activity.

2) in blk_cleanup_queue(), we only focus on passthrough request, and
passthrough request is always explicitly allocated & freed by
its caller, so once queue is frozen, all sync dispatch activity
for passthrough request has been done, then it is enough to just cancel
dispatch work for avoiding any dispatch activity.

CVE-2021-47553	2024-05-24T15:15:20.080	2025-09-18T15:11:36.080	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched/scs: Reset task stack state in bringup_cpu()

To hot unplug a CPU, the idle task on that CPU calls a few layers of C
code before finally leaving the kernel. When KASAN is in use, poisoned
shadow is left around for each of the active stack frames, and when
shadow call stacks are in use. When shadow call stacks (SCS) are in use
the task's saved SCS SP is left pointing at an arbitrary point within
the task's shadow call stack.

When a CPU is offlined than onlined back into the kernel, this stale
state can adversely affect execution. Stale KASAN shadow can alias new
stackframes and result in bogus KASAN warnings. A stale SCS SP is
effectively a memory leak, and prevents a portion of the shadow call
stack being used. Across a number of hotplug cycles the idle task's
entire shadow call stack can become unusable.

We previously fixed the KASAN issue in commit:

  e1b77c92981a5222 (""sched/kasan: remove stale KASAN poison after hotplug"")

... by removing any stale KASAN stack poison immediately prior to
onlining a CPU.

Subsequently in commit:

  f1a0a376ca0c4ef1 (""sched/core: Initialize the idle task with preemption disabled"")

... the refactoring left the KASAN and SCS cleanup in one-time idle
thread initialization code rather than something invoked prior to each
CPU being onlined, breaking both as above.

We fixed SCS (but not KASAN) in commit:

  63acd42c0d4942f7 (""sched/scs: Reset the shadow stack when idle_task_exit"")

... but as this runs in the context of the idle task being offlined it's
potentially fragile.

To fix these consistently and more robustly, reset the SCS SP and KASAN
shadow of a CPU's idle task immediately before we online that CPU in
bringup_cpu(). This ensures the idle task always has a consistent state
when it is running, and removes the need to so so when exiting an idle
task.

Whenever any thread is created, dup_task_struct() will give the task a
stack which is free of KASAN shadow, and initialize the task's SCS SP,
so there's no need to specially initialize either for idle thread within
init_idle(), as this was only necessary to handle hotplug cycles.

I've tested this on arm64 with:

* gcc 11.1.0, defconfig +KASAN_INLINE, KASAN_STACK
* clang 12.0.0, defconfig +KASAN_INLINE, KASAN_STACK, SHADOW_CALL_STACK

... offlining and onlining CPUS with:

| while true; do
|   for C in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/online; do
|     echo 0 > $C;
|     echo 1 > $C;

ethtool_set_coalesce() now uses both the .get_coalesce() and

Fix the condition so that the availability of both callbacks is
ensured. This also matches the netlink code.

Note that reproducing this requires some effort - it only affects the
legacy ioctl path, and needs a specific combination of driver options:
- have .get_coalesce() and .coalesce_supported but no
 .set_coalesce(), or

ice: fix vsi->txq_map sizing

The approach of having XDP queue per CPU regardless of user's setting
exposed a hidden bug that could occur in case when Rx queue count differ
from Tx queue count. Currently vsi->txq_map's size is equal to the
doubled vsi->alloc_txq, which is not correct due to the fact that XDP
rings were previously based on the Rx queue count. Below splat can be
seen when ethtool -L is used and XDP rings are configured:

ice: avoid bpf_prog refcount underflow

Ice driver has the routines for managing XDP resources that are shared
between ndo_bpf op and VSI rebuild flow. The latter takes place for
example when user changes queue count on an interface via ethtool's
set_channels().

There is an issue around the bpf_prog refcounting when VSI is being
rebuilt - since ice_prepare_xdp_rings() is called with vsi->xdp_prog as
an argument that is used later on by ice_vsi_assign_bpf_prog(), same
bpf_prog pointers are swapped with each other. Then it is also
interpreted as an 'old_prog' which in turn causes us to call
bpf_prog_put on it that will decrement its refcount.

Below splat can be interpreted in a way that due to zero refcount of a
bpf_prog it is wiped out from the system while kernel still tries to
refer to it:

net: nexthop: fix null pointer dereference when IPv6 is not enabled

When we try to add an IPv6 nexthop and IPv6 is not enabled
(!CONFIG_IPV6) we'll hit a NULL pointer dereference[1] in the error path
of nh_create_ipv6() due to calling ipv6_stub->fib6_nh_release. The bug
has been present since the beginning of IPv6 nexthop gateway support.
Commit 1aefd3de7bc6 (""ipv6: Add fib6_nh_init and release to stubs"") tells
us that only fib6_nh_init has a dummy stub because fib6_nh_release should
not be called if fib6_nh_init returns an error, but the commit below added
a call to ipv6_stub->fib6_nh_release in its error path. To fix it return
the dummy stub's -EAFNOSUPPORT error directly without calling
ipv6_stub->fib6_nh_release in nh_create_ipv6()'s error path.

 Output is a bit truncated, but it clearly shows the error.

A vulnerability that exists prior to commit 48e3e5e7ead6777fa75d57c7711c8e55b501c24e impacts all users who have performed verification with an instance of MIT IdentiBot that meets the following conditions: The instance of IdentiBot is tied to a ""public"" Discord application—i.e., users other than the API access registrant can add it to servers; *and* the instance has not yet been patched. In affected versions, IdentiBot does not check that a server is authorized before allowing members to execute slash and user commands in that server. As a result, any user can join IdentiBot to their server and then use commands (e.g., `/kerbid`) to reveal the full name and other information about a Discord user who has verified their affiliation with MIT using IdentiBot. The latest version of MIT IdentiBot contains a patch for this vulnerability (implemented in commit 48e3e5e7ead6777fa75d57c7711c8e55b501c24e).

CVE-2024-35238	2024-05-27T18:15:09.920	2024-11-21T09:19:59.900	"Minder by Stacklok is an open source software supply chain security platform. Minder prior to version 0.0.51 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack which could allow an attacker to crash the Minder server and deny other users access to it. The root cause of the vulnerability is that Minders sigstore verifier reads an untrusted response entirely into memory without enforcing a limit on the response body. An attacker can exploit this by making Minder make a request to an attacker-controlled endpoint which returns a response with a large body which will crash the Minder server. Specifically, the point of failure is where Minder parses the response from the GitHub attestations endpoint in `getAttestationReply`. Here, Minder makes a request to the `orgs/$owner/attestations/$checksumref` GitHub endpoint (line 285) and then parses the response into the `AttestationReply` (line 295). The way Minder parses the response on line 295 makes it prone to DoS if the response is large enough. Essentially, the response needs to be larger than the machine has available memory.  Version 0.0.51 contains a patch for this issue.

The content that is hosted at the `orgs/$owner/attestations/$checksumref` GitHub attestation endpoint is controlled by users including unauthenticated users to Minders threat model. However, a user will need to configure their own Minder settings to cause Minder to make Minder send a request to fetch the attestations. The user would need to know of a package whose attestations were configured in such a way that they would return a large response when fetching them. As such, the steps needed to carry out this attack would look as such:

1. The attacker adds a package to ghcr.io with attestations that can be fetched via the `orgs/$owner/attestations/$checksumref` GitHub endpoint.
2. The attacker registers on Minder and makes Minder fetch the attestations.
3. Minder fetches attestations and crashes thereby being denied of service."	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2023-52881	2024-05-29T11:16:02.110	2025-09-27T00:00:29.923	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: do not accept ACK of bytes we never sent

This patch is based on a detailed report and ideas from Yepeng Pan
and Christian Rossow.

ACK seq validation is currently following RFC 5961 5.2 guidelines:

   The ACK value is considered acceptable only if
   it is in the range of ((SND.UNA - MAX.SND.WND) <= SEG.ACK <=
   SND.NXT).  All incoming segments whose ACK value doesn't satisfy the
   above condition MUST be discarded and an ACK sent back.  It needs to
   be noted that RFC 793 on page 72 (fifth check) says: ""If the ACK is a
   duplicate (SEG.ACK < SND.UNA), it can be ignored.  If the ACK
   acknowledges something not yet sent (SEG.ACK > SND.NXT) then send an
   ACK, drop the segment, and return"".  The ""ignored"" above implies that
   the processing of the incoming data segment continues, which means
   the ACK value is treated as acceptable.  This mitigation makes the
   ACK check more stringent since any ACK < SND.UNA wouldn't be
   accepted, instead only ACKs that are in the range ((SND.UNA -
   MAX.SND.WND) <= SEG.ACK <= SND.NXT) get through.

This can be refined for new (and possibly spoofed) flows,
by not accepting ACK for bytes that were never sent.

This greatly improves TCP security at a little cost.

I added a Fixes: tag to make sure this patch will reach stable trees,
even if the 'blamed' patch was adhering to the RFC.

tp->bytes_acked was added in linux-4.2

Following packetdrill test (courtesy of Yepeng Pan) shows
the issue at hand:

+0 setsockopt(3, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, [1], 4) = 0
+0 bind(3, ..., ...) = 0

// ---------------- Handshake ------------------- //

// when window scale is set to 14 the window size can be extended to
// 65535 * (2^14) = 1073725440. Linux would accept an ACK packet
// with ack number in (Server_ISN+1-1073725440. Server_ISN+1)
// ,though this ack number acknowledges some data never

CVE-2024-36016	2024-05-29T19:15:48.297	2025-04-01T18:33:42.860	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tty: n_gsm: fix possible out-of-bounds in gsm0_receive()

Assuming the following:
- side A configures the n_gsm in basic option mode
- side B sends the header of a basic option mode frame with data length 1
- side A switches to advanced option mode
- side B sends 2 data bytes which exceeds gsm->len
  Reason: gsm->len is not used in advanced option mode.
- side A switches to basic option mode
- side B keeps sending until gsm0_receive() writes past gsm->buf
  Reason: Neither gsm->state nor gsm->len have been reset after
  reconfiguration.

Fix this by changing gsm->count to gsm->len comparison from equal to less
than. Also add upper limit checks against the constant MAX_MRU in
gsm0_receive() and gsm1_receive() to harden against memory corruption of
gsm->len and gsm->mru.

All other checks remain as we still need to limit the data according to the
user configuration and actual payload size."	7.7	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-35221	2024-05-29T21:15:49.017	2024-11-21T09:19:58.003	Rubygems.org is the Ruby community's gem hosting service. A Gem publisher can cause a Remote DoS when publishing a Gem. This is due to how Ruby reads the Manifest of Gem files when using Gem::Specification.from_yaml. from_yaml makes use of SafeYAML.load which allows YAML aliases inside the YAML-based metadata of a gem. YAML aliases allow for Denial of Service attacks with so-called `YAML-bombs` (comparable to Billion laughs attacks). This was patched. There is is no action required by users.

CVE-2024-36114	2024-05-29T21:15:49.237	2024-11-21T09:21:38.970	Aircompressor is a library with ports of the Snappy, LZO, LZ4, and Zstandard compression algorithms to Java. All decompressor implementations of Aircompressor (LZ4, LZO, Snappy, Zstandard) can crash the JVM for certain input, and in some cases also leak the content of other memory of the Java process (which could contain sensitive information). When decompressing certain data, the decompressors try to access memory outside the bounds of the given byte arrays or byte buffers. Because Aircompressor uses the JDK class `sun.misc.Unsafe` to speed up memory access, no additional bounds checks are performed and this has similar security consequences as out-of-bounds access in C or C++, namely it can lead to non-deterministic behavior or crash the JVM. Users should update to Aircompressor 0.27 or newer where these issues have been fixed. When decompressing data from untrusted users, this can be exploited for a denial-of-service attack by crashing the JVM, or to leak other sensitive information from the Java process. There are no known workarounds for this issue.	8.6	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H

of sizeof(struct ifla_vf_vlan_info) which is 14 bytes.
The current size validation in do_setvfinfo is against NLA_HDRLEN (4 bytes)

btrfs: zoned: do not flag ZEROOUT on non-dirty extent buffer

Btrfs clears the content of an extent buffer marked as
EXTENT_BUFFER_ZONED_ZEROOUT before the bio submission. This mechanism is
introduced to prevent a write hole of an extent buffer, which is once
allocated, marked dirty, but turns out unnecessary and cleaned up within
one transaction operation.

Currently, btrfs_clear_buffer_dirty() marks the extent buffer as
EXTENT_BUFFER_ZONED_ZEROOUT, and skips the entry function. If this call
happens while the buffer is under IO (with the WRITEBACK flag set,
without the DIRTY flag), we can add the ZEROOUT flag and clear the
buffer's content just before a bio submission. As a result:

1) it can lead to adding faulty delayed reference item which leads to a
   FS corrupted (EUCLEAN) error, and

2) it writes out cleared tree node on disk

The former issue is previously discussed in [1]. The corruption happens
when it runs a delayed reference update. So, on-disk data is safe.

[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/3f4f2a0ff1a6c818050434288925bdcf3cd719e5.1709124777.git.naohiro.aota@wdc.com/

The latter one can reach on-disk data. But, as that node is already
processed by btrfs_clear_buffer_dirty(), that will be invalidated in the
next transaction commit anyway. So, the chance of hitting the corruption
is relatively small.

Anyway, we should skip flagging ZEROOUT on a non-DIRTY extent buffer, to
keep the content under IO intact."	7.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H

mm/userfaultfd: reset ptes when close() for wr-protected ones

Userfaultfd unregister includes a step to remove wr-protect bits from all
the relevant pgtable entries, but that only covered an explicit
UFFDIO_UNREGISTER ioctl, not a close() on the userfaultfd itself.  Cover
that too.  This fixes a WARN trace.

The only user visible side effect is the user can observe leftover
wr-protect bits even if the user close()ed on an userfaultfd when
releasing the last reference of it.  However hopefully that should be
harmless, and nothing bad should happen even if so.

This change is now more important after the recent page-table-check
patch we merged in mm-unstable (446dd9ad37d0 (""mm/page_table_check:
support userfault wr-protect entries"")), as we'll do sanity check on
uffd-wp bits without vma context.  So it's better if we can 100%

is read twice, first to allocate an array, then to set s.len, which is
later used to limit the bounds of the array access.

It is possible that the array is allocated and another thread is
registering a new pernet ops, increments max_gen_ptrs, which is then used
to set s.len with a larger than allocated length for the variable array.

When fallback to TCP happens early on a client socket, snd_nxt
is not yet initialized and any incoming ack will copy such value
into snd_una. If the mptcp worker (dumbly) tries mptcp-level
re-injection after such ack, that would unconditionally trigger a send
buffer cleanup using 'bad' snd_una values.

We could easily disable re-injection for fallback sockets, but such
dumb behavior already helped catching a few subtle issues and a very
low to zero impact in practice.

Instead address the issue always initializing snd_nxt (and write_seq,
for consistency) at connect time."

mm/slub: avoid zeroing outside-object freepointer for single free

Commit 284f17ac13fe (""mm/slub: handle bulk and single object freeing
separately"") splits single and bulk object freeing in two functions
slab_free() and slab_free_bulk() which leads slab_free() to call
slab_free_hook() directly instead of slab_free_freelist_hook().

If `init_on_free` is set, slab_free_hook() zeroes the object.
Afterward, if `slub_debug=F` and `CONFIG_SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED` are
set, the do_slab_free() slowpath executes freelist consistency
checks and try to decode a zeroed freepointer which leads to a
""Freepointer corrupt"" detection in check_object().

During bulk free, slab_free_freelist_hook() isn't affected as it always
sets it objects freepointer using set_freepointer() to maintain its
reconstructed freelist after `init_on_free`.

For single free, object's freepointer thus needs to be avoided when
stored outside the object if `init_on_free` is set. The freepointer left
as is, check_object() may later detect an invalid pointer value due to
objects overflow.

To reproduce, set `slub_debug=FU init_on_free=1 log_level=7` on the
command line of a kernel build with `CONFIG_SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED=y`.

usb: gadget: f_fs: Fix race between aio_cancel() and AIO request complete

FFS based applications can utilize the aio_cancel() callback to dequeue
pending USB requests submitted to the UDC.  There is a scenario where the
FFS application issues an AIO cancel call, while the UDC is handling a
soft disconnect.  For a DWC3 based implementation, the callstack looks
like the following:

    DWC3 Gadget                               FFS Application
dwc3_gadget_soft_disconnect()              ...
  --> dwc3_stop_active_transfers()
    --> dwc3_gadget_giveback(-ESHUTDOWN)
      --> ffs_epfile_async_io_complete()   ffs_aio_cancel()
        --> usb_ep_free_request()            --> usb_ep_dequeue()

There is currently no locking implemented between the AIO completion
handler and AIO cancel, so the issue occurs if the completion routine is
running in parallel to an AIO cancel call coming from the FFS application.
As the completion call frees the USB request (io_data->req) the FFS
application is also referencing it for the usb_ep_dequeue() call.  This can
lead to accessing a stale/hanging pointer.

commit b566d38857fc (""usb: gadget: f_fs: use io_data->status consistently"")
relocated the usb_ep_free_request() into ffs_epfile_async_io_complete().
However, in order to properly implement locking to mitigate this issue, the
spinlock can't be added to ffs_epfile_async_io_complete(), as
usb_ep_dequeue() (if successfully dequeuing a USB request) will call the
function driver's completion handler in the same context.  Hence, leading
into a deadlock.

Fix this issue by moving the usb_ep_free_request() back to
ffs_user_copy_worker(), and ensuring that it explicitly sets io_data->req
to NULL after freeing it within the ffs->eps_lock.  This resolves the race
condition above, as the ffs_aio_cancel() routine will not continue
attempting to dequeue a request that has already been freed, or the
ffs_user_copy_work() not freeing the USB request until the AIO cancel is
done referencing it.

This fix depends on

usb: gadget: uvc: use correct buffer size when parsing configfs lists

This commit fixes uvc gadget support on 32-bit platforms.

Commit 0df28607c5cb (""usb: gadget: uvc: Generalise helper functions for
reuse"") introduced a helper function __uvcg_iter_item_entries() to aid
with parsing lists of items on configfs attributes stores. This function
is a generalization of another very similar function, which used a
stack-allocated temporary buffer of fixed size for each item in the list
and used the sizeof() operator to check for potential buffer overruns.
The new function was changed to allocate the now variably sized temp
buffer on heap, but wasn't properly updated to also check for max buffer
size using the computed size instead of sizeof() operator.

As a result, the maximum item size was 7 (plus null terminator) on
64-bit platforms, and 3 on 32-bit ones. While 7 is accidentally just
barely enough, 3 is definitely too small for some of UVC configfs
attributes. For example, dwFrameInteval, specified in 100ns units,
usually has 6-digit item values, e.g. 166666 for 60fps."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

gpiolib: cdev: Fix use after free in lineinfo_changed_notify

The use-after-free issue occurs as follows: when the GPIO chip device file
is being closed by invoking gpio_chrdev_release(), watched_lines is freed
by bitmap_free(), but the unregistration of lineinfo_changed_nb notifier
chain failed due to waiting write rwsem. Additionally, one of the GPIO
chip's lines is also in the release process and holds the notifier chain's
read rwsem. Consequently, a race condition leads to the use-after-free of
watched_lines.

Here is the typical stack when issue happened:

[free]
gpio_chrdev_release()
  --> bitmap_free(cdev->watched_lines)                  <-- freed
  --> blocking_notifier_chain_unregister()
    --> down_write(&nh->rwsem)                          <-- waiting rwsem
          --> __down_write_common()
            --> rwsem_down_write_slowpath()
                  --> schedule_preempt_disabled()
                    --> schedule()

[use]
st54spi_gpio_dev_release()
  --> gpio_free()
    --> gpiod_free()
      --> gpiod_free_commit()
        --> gpiod_line_state_notify()
          --> blocking_notifier_call_chain()
            --> down_read(&nh->rwsem);                  <-- held rwsem
            --> notifier_call_chain()
              --> lineinfo_changed_notify()
                --> test_bit(xxxx, cdev->watched_lines) <-- use after free

The side effect of the use-after-free issue is that a GPIO line event is
being generated for userspace where it shouldn't. However, since the chrdev
is being closed, userspace won't have the chance to read that event anyway.

To fix the issue, call the bitmap_free() function after the unregistration

tcp: Use refcount_inc_not_zero() in tcp_twsk_unique().

Anderson Nascimento reported a use-after-free splat in tcp_twsk_unique()
with nice analysis.

Since commit ec94c2696f0b (""tcp/dccp: avoid one atomic operation for
timewait hashdance""), inet_twsk_hashdance() sets TIME-WAIT socket's
sk_refcnt after putting it into ehash and releasing the bucket lock.

Thus, there is a small race window where other threads could try to
reuse the port during connect() and call sock_hold() in tcp_twsk_unique()
for the TIME-WAIT socket with zero refcnt.

If that happens, the refcnt taken by tcp_twsk_unique() is overwritten
and sock_put() will cause underflow, triggering a real use-after-free
somewhere else.

To avoid the use-after-free, we need to use refcount_inc_not_zero() in
tcp_twsk_unique() and give up on reusing the port if it returns false.

[0]:
refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.

CVE-2024-36905	2024-05-30T16:15:14.030	2025-01-14T17:15:17.077	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: defer shutdown(SEND_SHUTDOWN) for TCP_SYN_RECV sockets

TCP_SYN_RECV state is really special, it is only used by
cross-syn connections, mostly used by fuzzers.

In the following crash [1], syzbot managed to trigger a divide
by zero in tcp_rcv_space_adjust()

A socket makes the following state transitions,
without ever calling tcp_init_transfer(),
meaning tcp_init_buffer_space() is also not called.

         TCP_CLOSE
connect()
         TCP_SYN_SENT
         TCP_SYN_RECV
shutdown() -> tcp_shutdown(sk, SEND_SHUTDOWN)
         TCP_FIN_WAIT1

To fix this issue, change tcp_shutdown() to not
perform a TCP_SYN_RECV -> TCP_FIN_WAIT1 transition,
which makes no sense anyway.

When tcp_rcv_state_process() later changes socket state
from TCP_SYN_RECV to TCP_ESTABLISH, then look at
sk->sk_shutdown to finally enter TCP_FIN_WAIT1 state,
and send a FIN packet from a sane socket state.

This means tcp_send_fin() can now be called from BH
context, and must use GFP_ATOMIC allocations.

[   33.482978] ==================================================================

We find the root cause of this OOB is that arm does not clear stale stack
poison in the case of cpuidle.

This patch refer to arch/arm64/kernel/sleep.S to resolve this issue.

From cited commit [1] that explain the problem

Functions which the compiler has instrumented for KASAN place poison on
the stack shadow upon entry and remove this poison prior to returning.

In the case of cpuidle, CPUs exit the kernel a number of levels deep in
C code.  Any instrumented functions on this critical path will leave
portions of the stack shadow poisoned.

If CPUs lose context and return to the kernel via a cold path, we
restore a prior context saved in __cpu_suspend_enter are forgotten, and
we never remove the poison they placed in the stack shadow area by
functions calls between this and the actual exit of the kernel.

Thus, (depending on stackframe layout) subsequent calls to instrumented
functions may hit this stale poison, resulting in (spurious) KASAN
splats to the console.

To avoid this, clear any stale poison from the idle thread for a CPU
prior to bringing a CPU online.

From cited commit [2]

CVE-2024-36908	2024-05-30T16:15:14.300	2025-09-30T17:51:14.207	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-iocost: do not WARN if iocg was already offlined

In iocg_pay_debt(), warn is triggered if 'active_list' is empty, which
is intended to confirm iocg is active when it has debt. However, warn
can be triggered during a blkcg or disk removal, if iocg_waitq_timer_fn()
is run at that time:

  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 2344971 at block/blk-iocost.c:1402 iocg_pay_debt+0x14c/0x190
  Call trace:
  iocg_pay_debt+0x14c/0x190

  __run_hrtimer+0x144/0x45c
  __hrtimer_run_queues+0x16c/0x244
  hrtimer_interrupt+0x2cc/0x7b0

The warn in this situation is meaningless. Since this iocg is being
removed, the state of the 'active_list' is irrelevant, and 'waitq_timer'
is canceled after removing 'active_list' in ioc_pd_free(), which ensures
iocg is freed after iocg_waitq_timer_fn() returns.

Therefore, add the check if iocg was already offlined to avoid warn
when removing a blkcg or disk."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

powerpc/pseries/iommu: LPAR panics during boot up with a frozen PE

At the time of LPAR boot up, partition firmware provides Open Firmware
property ibm,dma-window for the PE. This property is provided on the PCI
bus the PE is attached to.

There are execptions where the partition firmware might not provide this
property for the PE at the time of LPAR boot up. One of the scenario is
where the firmware has frozen the PE due to some error condition. This
PE is frozen for 24 hours or unless the whole system is reinitialized.

Within this time frame, if the LPAR is booted, the frozen PE will be
presented to the LPAR but ibm,dma-window property could be missing.

Today, under these circumstances, the LPAR oopses with NULL pointer
dereference, when configuring the PCI bus the PE is attached to.

ipv4: Fix uninit-value access in __ip_make_skb()

KMSAN reported uninit-value access in __ip_make_skb() [1].  __ip_make_skb()
tests HDRINCL to know if the skb has icmphdr. However, HDRINCL can cause a
race condition. If calling setsockopt(2) with IP_HDRINCL changes HDRINCL
while __ip_make_skb() is running, the function will access icmphdr in the
skb even if it is not included. This causes the issue reported by KMSAN.

Check FLOWI_FLAG_KNOWN_NH on fl4->flowi4_flags instead of testing HDRINCL
on the socket.

Also, fl4->fl4_icmp_type and fl4->fl4_icmp_code are not initialized. These
are union in struct flowi4 and are implicitly initialized by
flowi4_init_output(), but we should not rely on specific union layout.

Initialize these explicitly in raw_sendmsg().

Analysis:
There is one napi structure per out_q: card->qdio.out_qs[i].napi
The napi.poll functions are set during qeth_open().

Since
commit 1cfef80d4c2b (""s390/qeth: Don't call dev_close/dev_open (DOWN/UP)"")
qeth_set_offline()/qeth_set_online() no longer call dev_close()/
dev_open(). So if qeth_free_qdio_queues() cleared
card->qdio.out_qs[i].napi.poll while the network interface was UP and the
card was offline, they are not set again.

Since thermal_debug_cdev_remove() does not run under cdev->lock, it can

the struct thermal_debugfs object used by the latter after it has been
checked against NULL.

If that happens, thermal_debug_cdev_state_update() will access memory
that has been freed already causing the kernel to crash.

Address this by using cdev->lock in thermal_debug_cdev_remove() around

nsh: Restore skb->{protocol,data,mac_header} for outer header in nsh_gso_segment().

syzbot triggered various splats (see [0] and links) by a crafted GSO
packet of VIRTIO_NET_HDR_GSO_UDP layering the following protocols:

  ETH_P_8021AD + ETH_P_NSH + ETH_P_IPV6 + IPPROTO_UDP

NSH can encapsulate IPv4, IPv6, Ethernet, NSH, and MPLS.  As the inner
protocol can be Ethernet, NSH GSO handler, nsh_gso_segment(), calls
skb_mac_gso_segment() to invoke inner protocol GSO handlers.

nsh_gso_segment() does the following for the original skb before
calling skb_mac_gso_segment()

  1. reset skb->network_header
  2. save the original skb->{mac_heaeder,mac_len} in a local variable
  3. pull the NSH header
  4. resets skb->mac_header
  5. set up skb->mac_len and skb->protocol for the inner protocol.

and does the following for the segmented skb

  6. set ntohs(ETH_P_NSH) to skb->protocol
  7. push the NSH header
  8. restore skb->mac_header
  9. set skb->mac_header + mac_len to skb->network_header
 10. restore skb->mac_len

There are two problems in 6-7 and 8-9.

  (a)
  After 6 & 7, skb->data points to the NSH header, so the outer header
  (ETH_P_8021AD in this case) is stripped when skb is sent out of netdev.

  Also, if NSH is encapsulated by NSH + Ethernet (so NSH-Ethernet-NSH),
  skb_pull() in the first nsh_gso_segment() will make skb->data point
  to the middle of the outer NSH or Ethernet header because the Ethernet
  header is not pulled by the second nsh_gso_segment().

  (b)
  While restoring skb->{mac_header,network_header} in 8 & 9,
  nsh_gso_segment() does not assume that the data in the linear
  buffer is shifted.

  However, udp6_ufo_fragment() could shift the data and change
  skb->mac_header accordingly as demonstrated by syzbot.

  If this happens, even the restored skb->mac_header points to
  the middle of the outer header.

It seems nsh_gso_segment() has never worked with outer headers so far.

At the end of nsh_gso_segment(), the outer header must be restored for
the segmented skb, instead of the NSH header.

To do that, let's calculate the outer header position relatively from
the inner header and set skb->{data,mac_header,protocol} properly.

Commit 50e782a86c98 (""efi/unaccepted: Fix soft lockups caused by

do memory acceptance in parallel and not triggers softlockup on other

However the softlock up was intermittent shown up if the memory of the

When the local irq is enabled at the end of accept_memory(), the
softlockup detects that the watchdog on single CPU has not been fed for
a while. That is to say, even other CPUs will not be blocked by
spinlock, the current CPU might be stunk with local irq disabled for a
while, which hurts not only nmi watchdog but also softlockup.

Chao Gao pointed out that the memory accept could be time costly and
there was similar report before. Thus to avoid any softlocup detection
during this stage, give the softlockup a flag to skip the timeout check
at the end of accept_memory(), by invoking touch_softlockup_watchdog()."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2024-36937	2024-05-30T16:15:16.797	2025-09-17T22:19:30.820	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xdp: use flags field to disambiguate broadcast redirect

When redirecting a packet using XDP, the bpf_redirect_map() helper will set
up the redirect destination information in struct bpf_redirect_info (using
the __bpf_xdp_redirect_map() helper function), and the xdp_do_redirect()
function will read this information after the XDP program returns and pass
the frame on to the right redirect destination.

When using the BPF_F_BROADCAST flag to do multicast redirect to a whole
map, __bpf_xdp_redirect_map() sets the 'map' pointer in struct
bpf_redirect_info to point to the destination map to be broadcast. And
xdp_do_redirect() reacts to the value of this map pointer to decide whether
it's dealing with a broadcast or a single-value redirect. However, if the
destination map is being destroyed before xdp_do_redirect() is called, the
map pointer will be cleared out (by bpf_clear_redirect_map()) without
waiting for any XDP programs to stop running. This causes xdp_do_redirect()
to think that the redirect was to a single target, but the target pointer
is also NULL (since broadcast redirects don't have a single target), so
this causes a crash when a NULL pointer is passed to dev_map_enqueue().

To fix this, change xdp_do_redirect() to react directly to the presence of
the BPF_F_BROADCAST flag in the 'flags' value in struct bpf_redirect_info
to disambiguate between a single-target and a broadcast redirect. And only
read the 'map' pointer if the broadcast flag is set, aborting if that has
been cleared out in the meantime. This prevents the crash, while keeping
the atomic (cmpxchg-based) clearing of the map pointer itself, and without
adding any more checks in the non-broadcast fast path."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

similarly due to no protection of saved_data_ready. Here is another
different caller causing the same issue because of the same reason. So
we should protect it with sk_callback_lock read lock because the writer

rpc_proc_register() was called in init_nfs_fs(), but its error

Recently, commit d47151b79e32 (""nfs: expose /proc/net/sunrpc/nfs

the problem more visible.

Even when rpc_proc_register() fails, nfs_net_init() could succeed,
and thus nfs_net_exit() will be called while destroying the netns.

Then, remove_proc_entry() will be called for non-existing proc
directory and trigger the warning below.

Let's handle the error of rpc_proc_register() properly in nfs_net_init().

firewire: ohci: mask bus reset interrupts between ISR and bottom half

In the FireWire OHCI interrupt handler, if a bus reset interrupt has
occurred, mask bus reset interrupts until bus_reset_work has serviced and
cleared the interrupt.

Normally, we always leave bus reset interrupts masked. We infer the bus
reset from the self-ID interrupt that happens shortly thereafter. A
scenario where we unmask bus reset interrupts was introduced in 2008 in
a007bb857e0b26f5d8b73c2ff90782d9c0972620: If
OHCI_PARAM_DEBUG_BUSRESETS (8) is set in the debug parameter bitmask, we
will unmask bus reset interrupts so we can log them.

irq_handler logs the bus reset interrupt. However, we can't clear the bus
reset event flag in irq_handler, because we won't service the event until
later. irq_handler exits with the event flag still set. If the
corresponding interrupt is still unmasked, the first bus reset will
usually freeze the system due to irq_handler being called again each
time it exits. This freeze can be reproduced by loading firewire_ohci
with ""modprobe firewire_ohci debug=-1"" (to enable all debugging output).
Apparently there are also some cases where bus_reset_work will get called
soon enough to clear the event, and operation will continue normally.

This freeze was first reported a few months after a007bb85 was committed,
but until now it was never fixed. The debug level could safely be set
to -1 through sysfs after the module was loaded, but this would be
ineffectual in logging bus reset interrupts since they were only
unmasked during initialization.

irq_handler will now leave the event flag set but mask bus reset
interrupts, so irq_handler won't be called again and there will be no
freeze. If OHCI_PARAM_DEBUG_BUSRESETS is enabled, bus_reset_work will
unmask the interrupt after servicing the event, so future interrupts
will be caught as desired.

As a side effect to this change, OHCI_PARAM_DEBUG_BUSRESETS can now be
enabled through sysfs in addition to during initial module loading.
However, when enabled through sysfs, logging of bus reset interrupts will
be effective only starting with the second bus reset, after
bus_reset_work has executed."	4.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-35228	2024-05-30T19:15:16.747	2024-11-21T09:19:58.907	Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. Due to an improperly applied permission check in the `wagtail.contrib.settings` module, a user with access to the Wagtail admin and knowledge of the URL of the edit view for a settings model can access and update that setting, even when they have not been granted permission over the model. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 6.0.5 and 6.1.2. Wagtail releases prior to 6.0 are unaffected. Users are advised to upgrade. Site owners who are unable to upgrade to a patched version can avoid the vulnerability in `ModelViewSet` by registering the model as a snippet instead. No workaround is available for `wagtail.contrib.settings`.	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2024-32877	2024-05-30T20:15:08.950	2025-09-22T14:01:45.423	"Yii 2 is a PHP application framework. During internal penetration testing of a product based on Yii2, users discovered a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the framework itself. This issue is relevant for the latest version of Yii2 (2.0.49.3). This issue lies in the mechanism for displaying function argument values in the stack trace. The vulnerability manifests when an argument's value exceeds 32 characters. For convenience, argument values exceeding this limit are truncated and displayed with an added ""..."". The full argument value becomes visible when hovering over it with the mouse, as it is displayed in the title attribute of a span tag. However, the use of a double quote ("") allows an attacker to break out of the title attribute's value context and inject their own attributes into the span tag, including malicious JavaScript code through event handlers such as onmousemove. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the security context of the victim's site via a specially crafted link. This could lead to the theft of cookies (including httpOnly cookies, which are accessible on the page), content substitution, or complete takeover of user accounts. This issue has been addressed in version 2.0.50. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."	4.2	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

CVE-2024-35189	2024-05-30T20:15:09.457	2024-11-21T09:19:53.847	"Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. The Fides webserver has a number of endpoints that retrieve `ConnectionConfiguration` records and their associated `secrets` which _can_ contain sensitive data (e.g. passwords, private keys, etc.). These `secrets` are stored encrypted at rest (in the application database), and the associated endpoints are not meant to expose that sensitive data in plaintext to API clients, as it could be compromising. Fides's developers have available to them a Pydantic field-attribute (`sensitive`) that they can annotate as `True` to indicate that a given secret field should not be exposed via the API. The application has an internal function that uses `sensitive` annotations to mask the sensitive fields with a `""**********""` placeholder value. This vulnerability is due to a bug in that function, which prevented `sensitive` API model fields that were _nested_ below the root-level of a `secrets` object from being masked appropriately. Only the `BigQuery` connection configuration secrets meets these criteria: the secrets schema has a nested sensitive `keyfile_creds.private_key` property that is exposed in plaintext via the APIs. Connection types other than `BigQuery` with sensitive fields at the root-level that are not nested are properly masked with the placeholder and are not affected by this vulnerability. This vulnerability has been patched in Fides version 2.37.0. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. Users are also advised to rotate any Google Cloud secrets used for BigQuery integrations in their Fides deployments. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

In affected versions users registering via the `user:register_form` tag will have their password confirmation stored in plain text in their user file. This only affects sites matching **all** of the following conditions: 1. Running Statamic versions between 5.3.0 and 5.6.1. (This version range represents only one calendar week), 2. Using the `user:register_form` tag. 3. Using file-based user accounts. (Does not affect users stored in a database.), 4. Has users that have registered during that time period. (Existing users are not affected.). Additionally passwords are only visible to users that have access to read user yaml files, typically developers of the application itself. This issue has been patched in version 5.6.2, however any users registered during that time period and using the affected version range will still have the the `password_confirmation` value in their yaml files. We recommend that affected users have their password reset. System administrators are advised to upgrade their deployments. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Anyone who commits their files to a public git repo, may consider clearing the sensitive data from the git history as it is likely that passwords were uploaded.	1.8	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

Sentry's Slack integration incorrectly records the incoming request body in logs. This request data can contain sensitive information, including the deprecated Slack verification token. With this verification token, it is possible under specific configurations, an attacker can forge requests and act as the Slack integration. The request body is leaked in log entries matching `event == ""slack.*"" && name == ""sentry.integrations.slack"" && request_data == *`. The deprecated slack verification token, will be found in the `request_data.token` key. **SaaS users** do not need to take any action. **Self-hosted users** should upgrade to version 24.5.0 or higher, rotate their Slack verification token, and use the Slack Signing Secret instead of the verification token. For users only using the `slack.signing-secret` in their self-hosted configuration, the legacy verification token is not used to verify the webhook payload. It is ignored. Users unable to upgrade should either set the `slack.signing-secret` instead of `slack.verification-token`. The signing secret is Slack's recommended way of authenticating webhooks. By having `slack.singing-secret` set, Sentry self-hosted will no longer use the verification token for authentication of the webhooks, regardless of whether `slack.verification-token` is set or not. Alternatively if the self-hosted instance is unable to be upgraded or re-configured to use the `slack.signing-secret`, the logging configuration can be adjusted to not generate logs from the integration. The default logging configuration can be found in `src/sentry/conf/server.py`. **Services should be restarted once the configuration change is saved.**
