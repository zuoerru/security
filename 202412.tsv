nommu: pass NULL argument to vma_iter_prealloc()

When deleting a vma entry from a maple tree, it has to pass NULL to
vma_iter_prealloc() in order to calculate internal state of the tree, but
it passed a wrong argument.  As a result, nommu kernels crashed upon
accessing a vma iterator, such as acct_collect() reading the size of vma
entries after do_munmap().

mm/mremap: fix address wraparound in move_page_tables()

On 32-bit platforms, it is possible for the expression `len + old_addr <
old_end` to be false-positive if `len + old_addr` wraps around. 
`old_addr` is the cursor in the old range up to which page table entries
have been moved; so if the operation succeeded, `old_addr` is the *end* of
the old region, and adding `len` to it can wrap.

The overflow causes mremap() to mistakenly believe that PTEs have been
copied; the consequence is that mremap() bails out, but doesn't move the
PTEs back before the new VMA is unmapped, causing anonymous pages in the
region to be lost.  So basically if userspace tries to mremap() a
private-anon region and hits this bug, mremap() will return an error and
the private-anon region's contents appear to have been zeroed.

The idea of this check is that `old_end - len` is the original start
address, and writing the check that way also makes it easier to read; so
fix the check by rearranging the comparison accordingly.

(An alternate fix would be to refactor this function by introducing an
""orig_old_start"" variable or such.)

mm: fix NULL pointer dereference in alloc_pages_bulk_noprof

We triggered a NULL pointer dereference for ac.preferred_zoneref->zone in
alloc_pages_bulk_noprof() when the task is migrated between cpusets.

When cpuset is enabled, in prepare_alloc_pages(), ac->nodemask may be
&current->mems_allowed.  when first_zones_zonelist() is called to find
preferred_zoneref, the ac->nodemask may be modified concurrently if the
task is migrated between different cpusets.  Assuming we have 2 NUMA Node,
when traversing Node1 in ac->zonelist, the nodemask is 2, and when
traversing Node2 in ac->zonelist, the nodemask is 1.  As a result, the
ac->preferred_zoneref points to NULL zone.

In alloc_pages_bulk_noprof(), for_each_zone_zonelist_nodemask() finds a
allowable zone and calls zonelist_node_idx(ac.preferred_zoneref), leading
to NULL pointer dereference.

__alloc_pages_noprof() fixes this issue by checking NULL pointer in commit
ea57485af8f4 (""mm, page_alloc: fix check for NULL preferred_zone"") and
commit df76cee6bbeb (""mm, page_alloc: remove redundant checks from alloc

- Lock the FTE, delete it from hardware, set the hardware deletion function
  to NULL and unlock the FTE.
- Lock the parent flow group, delete the software copy of the FTE, and
  remove it from the xarray.

However, this approach encounters a race condition if a rule with the same
match value is added simultaneously. In this scenario, fs_core may set the
hardware deletion function to NULL prematurely, causing a panic during
subsequent rule deletions.

To prevent this, ensure the active flag of the FTE is checked under a lock,
which will prevent the fs_core layer from attaching a new steering rule to
an FTE that is in the process of deletion.

Its possible that two threads call tcp_v6_do_rcv()/sk_forward_alloc_add()
concurrently when sk->sk_state == TCP_LISTEN with sk->sk_lock unlocked,
which triggers a data-race around sk->sk_forward_alloc:
tcp_v6_rcv

            sk_rmem_schedule

                    sk_forward_alloc_add()
            skb_set_owner_r
                sk_mem_charge
                    sk_forward_alloc_add()
        __kfree_skb

                            sk_forward_alloc_add()
                            sk_mem_reclaim

                                    sk_forward_alloc_add()

In this syzkaller testcase, two threads call
tcp_v6_do_rcv() with skb->truesize=768, the sk_forward_alloc changes like
this:
 (cpu 1)             | (cpu 2)             | sk_forward_alloc
 ...                 | ...                 | 0
 __sk_mem_schedule() |                     | +4096 = 4096
                     | __sk_mem_schedule() | +4096 = 8192
 sk_mem_charge()     |                     | -768  = 7424
                     | sk_mem_charge()     | -768  = 6656
 ...                 |    ...              |
 sk_mem_uncharge()   |                     | +768  = 7424
 reclaimable=7424    |                     |
                     | sk_mem_uncharge()   | +768  = 8192
                     | reclaimable=8192    |
 __sk_mem_reclaim()  |                     | -4096 = 4096
                     | __sk_mem_reclaim()  | -8192 = -4096 != 0

The skb_clone_and_charge_r() should not be called in tcp_v6_do_rcv() when
sk->sk_state is TCP_LISTEN, it happens later in tcp_v6_syn_recv_sock().

CVE-2024-53862	2024-12-02T16:15:14.277	2024-12-02T16:15:14.277	Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. When using `--auth-mode=client`, Archived Workflows can be retrieved with a fake or spoofed token via the GET Workflow endpoint: `/api/v1/workflows/{namespace}/{name}` or when using `--auth-mode=sso`, all Archived Workflows can be retrieved with a valid token via the GET Workflow endpoint: `/api/v1/workflows/{namespace}/{name}`. No authentication is performed by the Server itself on `client` tokens. Authentication & authorization is instead delegated to the k8s API server. However, the Workflow Archive does not interact with k8s, and so any token that looks valid will be considered authenticated, even if it is not a k8s token or even if the token has no RBAC for Argo. To handle the lack of pass-through k8s authN/authZ, the Workflow Archive specifically does the equivalent of a `kubectl auth can-i` check for respective methods. In 3.5.7 and 3.5.8, the auth check was accidentally removed on the GET Workflow endpoint's fallback to archived workflows on these lines, allowing archived workflows to be retrieved with a fake token. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.6.2 and 3.5.13.					
CVE-2024-53981	2024-12-02T16:15:14.457	2024-12-02T16:15:14.457	python-multipart is a streaming multipart parser for Python. When parsing form data, python-multipart skips line breaks (CR \r or LF \n) in front of the first boundary and any tailing bytes after the last boundary. This happens one byte at a time and emits a log event each time, which may cause excessive logging for certain inputs. An attacker could abuse this by sending a malicious request with lots of data before the first or after the last boundary, causing high CPU load and stalling the processing thread for a significant amount of time. In case of ASGI application, this could stall the event loop and prevent other requests from being processed, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).

Since affected quic-go versions used IP_PMTUDISC_DO, the kernel would then return a ""message too large"" error on sendmsg, i.e. when quic-go attempts to send a packet that exceeds the MTU claimed in that ICMP packet. By setting this value to smaller than 1200 bytes (the minimum MTU for QUIC), the attacker can disrupt a QUIC connection. Crucially, this can be done after completion of the handshake, thereby circumventing any TCP fallback that might be implemented on the application layer (for example, many browsers fall back to HTTP over TCP if they're unable to establish a QUIC connection). The attacker needs to at least know the client's IP and port tuple to mount an attack. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.48.2."	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

An implementation bug in the Kolide Agent (known as `launcher`) allows for local privilege escalation to the SYSTEM user on Windows 10 and 11. The bug was introduced in version 1.5.3 when launcher started storing upgraded binaries in the ProgramData directory. This move to the new directory meant the launcher root directory inherited default permissions that are not as strict as the previous location. These incorrect default permissions in conjunction with an omitted SystemDrive environmental variable (when launcher starts osqueryd), allows a malicious actor with access to the local Windows device to successfully place an arbitrary DLL into the osqueryd process's search path. Under some circumstances, this DLL will be executed when osqueryd performs a WMI query. This combination of events could then allow the attacker to escalate their privileges to SYSTEM. Impacted versions include versions >= 1.5.3 and the fix has been released in 1.12.3.

nilfs2: fix null-ptr-deref in block_dirty_buffer tracepoint

When using the ""block:block_dirty_buffer"" tracepoint, mark_buffer_dirty()
may cause a NULL pointer dereference, or a general protection fault when
KASAN is enabled.

This happens because, since the tracepoint was added in
mark_buffer_dirty(), it references the dev_t member bh->b_bdev->bd_dev
regardless of whether the buffer head has a pointer to a block_device
structure.

In the current implementation, nilfs_grab_buffer(), which grabs a buffer
to read (or create) a block of metadata, including b-tree node blocks,
does not set the block device, but instead does so only if the buffer is
not in the ""uptodate"" state for each of its caller block reading
functions.  However, if the uptodate flag is set on a folio/page, and the
buffer heads are detached from it by try_to_free_buffers(), and new buffer
heads are then attached by create_empty_buffers(), the uptodate flag may
be restored to each buffer without the block device being set to
bh->b_bdev, and mark_buffer_dirty() may be called later in that state,
resulting in the bug mentioned above.

Fix this issue by making nilfs_grab_buffer() always set the block device
of the super block structure to the buffer head, regardless of the state
of the buffer's uptodate flag."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

nilfs2: fix null-ptr-deref in block_touch_buffer tracepoint

Patch series ""nilfs2: fix null-ptr-deref bugs on block tracepoints"".

This series fixes null pointer dereference bugs that occur when using
nilfs2 and two block-related tracepoints.


This patch (of 2):

It has been reported that when using ""block:block_touch_buffer""
tracepoint, touch_buffer() called from __nilfs_get_folio_block() causes a
NULL pointer dereference, or a general protection fault when KASAN is
enabled.

This happens because since the tracepoint was added in touch_buffer(), it
references the dev_t member bh->b_bdev->bd_dev regardless of whether the
buffer head has a pointer to a block_device structure.  In the current
implementation, the block_device structure is set after the function
returns to the caller.

Here, touch_buffer() is used to mark the folio/page that owns the buffer
head as accessed, but the common search helper for folio/page used by the
caller function was optimized to mark the folio/page as accessed when it
was reimplemented a long time ago, eliminating the need to call
touch_buffer() here in the first place.

So this solves the issue by eliminating the touch_buffer() call itself."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

KVM: VMX: Bury Intel PT virtualization (guest/host mode) behind CONFIG_BROKEN

Hide KVM's pt_mode module param behind CONFIG_BROKEN, i.e. disable support
for virtualizing Intel PT via guest/host mode unless BROKEN=y.  There are
myriad bugs in the implementation, some of which are fatal to the guest,
and others which put the stability and health of the host at risk.

For guest fatalities, the most glaring issue is that KVM fails to ensure
tracing is disabled, and *stays* disabled prior to VM-Enter, which is
necessary as hardware disallows loading (the guest's) RTIT_CTL if tracing
is enabled (enforced via a VMX consistency check).  Per the SDM:

  If the logical processor is operating with Intel PT enabled (if
  IA32_RTIT_CTL.TraceEn = 1) at the time of VM entry, the ""load
  IA32_RTIT_CTL"" VM-entry control must be 0.

On the host side, KVM doesn't validate the guest CPUID configuration
provided by userspace, and even worse, uses the guest configuration to
decide what MSRs to save/load at VM-Enter and VM-Exit.  E.g. configuring
guest CPUID to enumerate more address ranges than are supported in hardware
will result in KVM trying to passthrough, save, and load non-existent MSRs,
which generates a variety of WARNs, ToPA ERRORs in the host, a potential
deadlock, etc."	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H

netlink: terminate outstanding dump on socket close

Netlink supports iterative dumping of data. It provides the families
the following ops:
 - start - (optional) kicks off the dumping process
 - dump  - actual dump helper, keeps getting called until it returns 0
 - done  - (optional) pairs with .start, can be used for cleanup
The whole process is asynchronous and the repeated calls to .dump
don't actually happen in a tight loop, but rather are triggered
in response to recvmsg() on the socket.

This gives the user full control over the dump, but also means that
the user can close the socket without getting to the end of the dump.
To make sure .start is always paired with .done we check if there
is an ongoing dump before freeing the socket, and if so call .done.

The complication is that sockets can get freed from BH and .done
is allowed to sleep. So we use a workqueue to defer the call, when
needed.

Unfortunately this does not work correctly. What we defer is not
the cleanup but rather releasing a reference on the socket.
We have no guarantee that we own the last reference, if someone
else holds the socket they may release it in BH and we're back
to square one.

The whole dance, however, appears to be unnecessary. Only the user
can interact with dumps, so we can clean up when socket is closed.
And close always happens in process context. Some async code may
still access the socket after close, queue notification skbs to it etc.
but no dumps can start, end or otherwise make progress.

Delete the workqueue and flush the dump state directly from the release
handler. Note that further cleanup is possible in -next, for instance
we now always call .done before releasing the main module reference,
so dump doesn't have to take a reference of its own."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-54140	2024-12-05T22:15:20.400	2024-12-05T22:15:20.400	sigstore-java is a sigstore java client for interacting with sigstore infrastructure. sigstore-java has insufficient verification for a situation where a bundle provides a invalid signature for a checkpoint. This bug impacts clients using any variation of KeylessVerifier.verify(). Currently checkpoints are only used to ensure the root hash of an inclusion proof was provided by the log in question. Failing to validate that means a bundle may provide an inclusion proof that doesn't actually correspond to the log in question. This may eventually lead a monitor/witness being unable to detect when a compromised logs are providing different views of themselves to different clients. There are other mechanisms right now that mitigate this, such as the signed entry timestamp. Sigstore-java currently requires a valid signed entry timestamp. By correctly verifying the signed entry timestamp we can make certain assertions about the log signing the log entry (like the log was aware of the artifact signing event and signed it). Therefore the impact on clients that are not monitors/witnesses is very low. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.2.0.

CVE-2024-53142	2024-12-06T10:15:06.203	2024-12-14T21:15:38.707	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

initramfs: avoid filename buffer overrun

The initramfs filename field is defined in
Documentation/driver-api/early-userspace/buffer-format.rst as:

 37 cpio_file := ALGN(4) + cpio_header + filename + ""\0"" + ALGN(4) + data
...
 55 ============= ================== =========================
 56 Field name    Field size         Meaning
 57 ============= ================== =========================
...
 70 c_namesize    8 bytes            Length of filename, including final \0

When extracting an initramfs cpio archive, the kernel's do_name() path
handler assumes a zero-terminated path at @collected, passing it
directly to filp_open() / init_mkdir() / init_mknod().

If a specially crafted cpio entry carries a non-zero-terminated filename
and is followed by uninitialized memory, then a file may be created with
trailing characters that represent the uninitialized memory. The ability
to create an initramfs entry would imply already having full control of
the system, so the buffer overrun shouldn't be considered a security
vulnerability.

Append the output of the following bash script to an existing initramfs
and observe any created /initramfs_test_fname_overrunAA* path. E.g.
  ./reproducer.sh | gzip >> /myinitramfs

It's easiest to observe non-zero uninitialized memory when the output is
gzipped, as it'll overflow the heap allocated @out_buf in __gunzip(),
rather than the initrd_start+initrd_size block.

fsnotify: Fix ordering of iput() and watched_objects decrement

Ensure the superblock is kept alive until we're done with iput().
Holding a reference to an inode is not allowed unless we ensure the
superblock stays alive, which fsnotify does by keeping the
watched_objects count elevated, so iput() must happen before the
watched_objects decrement.
This can lead to a UAF of something like sb->s_fs_info in tmpfs, but the
UAF is hard to hit because race orderings that oops are more likely, thanks
to the CHECK_DATA_CORRUPTION() block in generic_shutdown_super().

Also, ensure that fsnotify_put_sb_watched_objects() doesn't call
fsnotify_sb_watched_objects() on a superblock that may have already been
freed, which would cause a UAF read of sb->s_fsnotify_info."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2024-54149	2024-12-09T21:15:08.600	2025-06-24T16:34:55.680	Winter is a free, open-source content management system (CMS) based on the Laravel PHP framework. Winter CMS prior to versions 1.2.7, 1.1.11, and 1.0.476 allow users with access to the CMS templates sections that modify Twig files to bypass the sandbox placed on Twig files and modify resources such as theme customisation values or modify, or remove, templates in the theme even if not provided direct access via the permissions. As all objects passed through to Twig are references to the live objects, it is also possible to also manipulate model data if models are passed directly to Twig, including changing attributes or even removing records entirely. In most cases, this is unwanted behavior and potentially dangerous. To actively exploit this security issue, an attacker would need access to the Backend with a user account with any of the following permissions: `cms.manage_layouts`; `cms.manage_pages`; or `cms.manage_partials`. The Winter CMS maintainers strongly recommend that these permissions only be reserved to trusted administrators and developers in general. The maintainers of Winter CMS have significantly increased the scope of the sandbox, effectively making all models and datasources read-only in Twig, in versions 1.2.7, 1.1.11, and 1.0.476. Thse who cannot upgrade may apply commit fb88e6fabde3b3278ce1844e581c87dcf7daee22 to their Winter CMS installation manually to resolve the issue. In the rare event that a Winter user was relying on being able to write to models/datasources within their Twig templates, they should instead use or create components to make changes to their models.	8.4	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2024-53866	2024-12-10T18:15:42.160	2025-09-22T18:03:42.330	The package manager pnpm prior to version 9.15.0 seems to mishandle overrides and global cache: Overrides from one workspace leak into npm metadata saved in global cache; npm metadata from global cache affects other workspaces; and installs by default don't revalidate the data (including on first lockfile generation). This can make workspace A (even running with `ignore-scripts=true`) posion global cache and execute scripts in workspace B. Users generally expect `ignore-scripts` to be sufficient to prevent immediate code execution on install (e.g. when the tree is just repacked/bundled without executing it). Here, that expectation is broken. Global state integrity is lost via operations that one would expect to be secure, enabling subsequently running arbitrary code execution on installs. Version 9.15.0 fixes the issue. As a work-around, use separate cache and store dirs in each workspace.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2024-54133	2024-12-10T23:15:06.240	2025-03-07T01:15:11.650	Action Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web requests. There is a possible Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability  in the `content_security_policy` helper starting in version 5.2.0 of Action Pack and prior to versions 7.0.8.7, 7.1.5.1, 7.2.2.1, and 8.0.0.1. Applications which set Content-Security-Policy (CSP) headers dynamically from untrusted user input may be vulnerable to carefully crafted inputs being able to inject new directives into the CSP. This could lead to a bypass of the CSP and its protection against XSS and other attacks. Versions 7.0.8.7, 7.1.5.1, 7.2.2.1, and 8.0.0.1 contain a fix. As a workaround, applications can avoid setting CSP headers dynamically from untrusted input, or can validate/sanitize that input.					
CVE-2024-55653	2024-12-10T23:15:06.410	2025-04-18T17:35:00.030	PwnDoc is a penetration test report generator. In versions up to and including 0.5.3, an authenticated user is able to crash the backend by raising a `UnhandledPromiseRejection` on audits which exits the backend. The user doesn't need to know the audit id, since a bad audit id will also raise the rejection. With the backend being unresponsive, the whole application becomes unusable for all users of the application.

CVE-2024-55655	2024-12-10T23:15:06.570	2024-12-10T23:15:06.570	"sigstore-python is a Python tool for generating and verifying Sigstore signatures. Versions of sigstore-python newer than 2.0.0 but prior to 3.6.0 perform insufficient validation of the ""integration time"" present in ""v2"" and ""v3"" bundles during the verification flow: the ""integration time"" is verified *if* a source of signed time (such as an inclusion promise) is present, but is otherwise trusted if no source of signed time is present. This does not affect ""v1"" bundles, as the ""v1"" bundle format always requires an inclusion promise.

Sigstore uses signed time to support verification of signatures made against short-lived signing keys. The impact and severity of this weakness is *low*, as Sigstore contains multiple other enforcing components that prevent an attacker who modifies the integration timestamp within a bundle from impersonating a valid signature. In particular, an attacker who modifies the integration timestamp can induce a Denial of Service, but in no different manner than already possible with bundle access (e.g. modifying the signature itself such that it fails to verify). Separately, an attacker could upload a *new* entry to the transparency service, and substitute their new entry's time. However, this would still be rejected at validation time, as the new entry's (valid) signed time would be outside the validity window of the original signing certificate and would nonetheless render the attacker auditable."

The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that ""A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate."" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth. Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field. Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance."	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

CVE-2024-47537	2024-12-12T02:03:27.877	2024-12-19T15:20:52.377	GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. The program attempts to reallocate the memory pointed to by stream->samples to accommodate stream->n_samples + samples_count elements of type QtDemuxSample. The problem is that samples_count is read from the input file. And if this value is big enough, this can lead to an integer overflow during the addition. As a consequence, g_try_renew might allocate memory for a significantly smaller number of elements than intended. Following this, the program iterates through samples_count elements and attempts to write samples_count number of elements, potentially exceeding the actual allocated memory size and causing an OOB-write.

CVE-2024-47538	2024-12-12T02:03:28.070	2024-12-19T22:15:05.900	GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A stack-buffer overflow has been detected in the `vorbis_handle_identification_packet` function within `gstvorbisdec.c`. The position array is a stack-allocated buffer of size 64. If vd->vi.channels exceeds 64, the for loop will write beyond the boundaries of the position array. The value written will always be `GST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_NONE`. This vulnerability allows someone to overwrite the EIP address allocated in the stack. Additionally, this bug can overwrite the `GstAudioInfo` info structure.

CVE-2024-47539	2024-12-12T02:03:28.203	2024-12-18T21:52:56.307	GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An out-of-bounds write vulnerability was identified in the convert_to_s334_1a function in isomp4/qtdemux.c. The vulnerability arises due to a discrepancy between the size of memory allocated to the storage array and the loop condition i * 2 < ccpair_size. Specifically, when ccpair_size is even, the allocated size in storage does not match the loop's expected bounds, resulting in an out-of-bounds write. This bug allows for the overwriting of up to 3 bytes beyond the allocated bounds of the storage array. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2024-47540	2024-12-12T02:03:28.343	2024-12-18T21:53:53.963	GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An uninitialized stack variable vulnerability has been identified in the gst_matroska_demux_add_wvpk_header function within matroska-demux.c. When size < 4, the program calls gst_buffer_unmap with an uninitialized map variable.

An integer underflow has been detected in the function qtdemux_parse_theora_extension within qtdemux.c. The vulnerability occurs due to an underflow of the gint size variable, which causes size to hold a large unintended value when cast to an unsigned integer. This 32-bit negative value is then cast to a 64-bit unsigned integer (0xfffffffffffffffa) in a subsequent call to gst_buffer_new_and_alloc. The function gst_buffer_new_allocate then attempts to allocate memory, eventually calling _sysmem_new_block. The function _sysmem_new_block adds alignment and header size to the (unsigned) size, causing the overflow of the 'slice_size' variable. As a result, only 0x89 bytes are allocated, despite the large input size. When the following memcpy call occurs in gst_buffer_fill, the data from the input file will overwrite the content of the GstMapInfo info structure. Finally, during the call to gst_memory_unmap, the overwritten memory may cause a function pointer hijack, as the mem->allocator->mem_unmap_full function is called with a corrupted pointer. This function pointer overwrite could allow an attacker to alter the execution flow of the program, leading to arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2024-53845	2024-12-12T02:15:29.087	2024-12-12T02:15:29.087	ESPTouch is a connection protocol for internet of things devices. In the ESPTouchV2 protocol, while there is an option to use a custom AES key, there is no option to set the IV (Initialization Vector) prior to versions 5.3.2, 5.2.4, 5.1.6, and 5.0.8. The IV is set to zero and remains constant throughout the product's lifetime. In AES/CBC mode, if the IV is not properly initialized, the encrypted output becomes deterministic, leading to potential data leakage. To address the aforementioned issues, the application generates a random IV when activating the AES key starting in versions 5.3.2, 5.2.4, 5.1.6, and 5.0.8. This IV is then transmitted along with the provision data to the provision device. The provision device has also been equipped with a parser for the AES IV. The upgrade is applicable for all applications and users of ESPTouch v2 component from ESP-IDF. As it is implemented in the ESP Wi-Fi stack, there is no workaround for the user to fix the application layer without upgrading the underlying firmware.

RPKI Relying Parties (such as Fort) are supposed to maintain a backup cache of the remote RPKI data. This can be employed as a fallback in case a new fetch fails or yields incorrect files. However, the product currently uses its cache merely as a bandwidth saving tool (because fetching is performed through deltas). If a fetch fails midway or yields incorrect files, there is no viable fallback. This leads to incomplete route origin validation data.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N		
CVE-2024-56170	2024-12-18T05:15:09.093	2025-04-22T15:35:05.487	A validation integrity issue was discovered in Fort through 1.6.4 before 2.0.0. RPKI manifests are listings of relevant files that clients are supposed to verify. Assuming everything else is correct, the most recent version of a manifest should be prioritized over other versions, to prevent replays, accidental or otherwise. Manifests contain the manifestNumber and thisUpdate fields, which can be used to gauge the relevance of a given manifest, when compared to other manifests. The former is a serial-like sequential number, and the latter is the date on which the manifest was created. However, the product does not compare the up-to-dateness of the most recently fetched manifest against the cached manifest. As such, it's prone to a rollback to a previous version if it's served a valid outdated manifest. This leads to outdated route origin validation.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

CVE-2024-56128	2024-12-18T14:15:23.277	2025-06-20T18:13:13.550	"Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm in Apache Kafka's SCRAM implementation.

Issue Summary:
Apache Kafka's implementation of the Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) did not fully adhere to the requirements of RFC 5802 [1].
Specifically, as per RFC 5802, the server must verify that the nonce sent by the client in the second message matches the nonce sent by the server in its first message.
However, Kafka's SCRAM implementation did not perform this validation.

Impact:
This vulnerability is exploitable only when an attacker has plaintext access to the SCRAM authentication exchange. However, the usage of SCRAM over plaintext is strongly
discouraged as it is considered an insecure practice [2]. Apache Kafka recommends deploying SCRAM exclusively with TLS encryption to protect SCRAM exchanges from interception [3].
Deployments using SCRAM with TLS are not affected by this issue.

How to Detect If You Are Impacted:
If your deployment uses SCRAM authentication over plaintext communication channels (without TLS encryption), you are likely impacted.
To check if TLS is enabled, review your server.properties configuration file for listeners property. If you have SASL_PLAINTEXT in the listeners, then you are likely impacted.

Fix Details:
The issue has been addressed by introducing nonce verification in the final message of the SCRAM authentication exchange to ensure compliance with RFC 5802.

Affected Versions:
Apache Kafka versions 0.10.2.0 through 3.9.0, excluding the fixed versions below.

Fixed Versions:
3.9.0
3.8.1
3.7.2

Users are advised to upgrade to 3.7.2 or later to mitigate this issue.

Recommendations for Mitigation:
Users unable to upgrade to the fixed versions can mitigate the issue by:
- Using TLS with SCRAM Authentication:
Always deploy SCRAM over TLS to encrypt authentication exchanges and protect against interception.
- Considering Alternative Authentication Mechanisms:
Evaluate alternative authentication mechanisms, such as PLAIN, Kerberos or OAuth with TLS, which provide additional layers of security."	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

CVE-2024-55603	2024-12-19T00:15:06.713	2025-03-12T17:42:31.367	"Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. In affected versions sessions are still usable even though their lifetime has exceeded. Kanboard implements a cutom session handler (`app/Core/Session/SessionHandler.php`), to store the session data in a database. Therefore, when a `session_id` is given, kanboard queries the data from the `sessions` sql table. At this point, it does not correctly verify, if a given `session_id` has already exceeded its lifetime (`expires_at`).
Thus, a session which's lifetime is already `> time()`, is still queried from the database and hence a valid login. The implemented **SessionHandlerInterface::gc** function, that does remove invalid sessions, is called only **with a certain probability** (_Cleans up expired sessions. Called by `session_start()`, based on `session.gc_divisor`, `session.gc_probability` and `session.gc_maxlifetime` settings_) accordingly to the php documentation. In the official Kanboard docker image these values default to: session.gc_probability=1, session.gc_divisor=1000. Thus, an expired session is only terminated with probability 1/1000. This issue has been addressed in release 1.2.43 and all users are advised to upgrade.

guests, when the (virtual) VGA is in ""standard"" mode.  Locking involved
there has an unusual discipline, leaving a lock acquired past the
return from the function that acquired it.  This behavior results in a
problem when emulating an instruction with two memory accesses, both of
which touch VGA memory (plus some further constraints which aren't
relevant here).  When emulating the 2nd access, the lock that is already
being held would be attempted to be re-acquired, resulting in a
deadlock.

This deadlock was already found when the code was first introduced, but
was analysed incorrectly and the fix was incomplete.  Analysis in light
of the new finding cannot find a way to make the existing locking
discipline work.

In staging, this logic has all been removed because it was discovered
to be accidentally disabled since Xen 4.7.  Therefore, we are fixing the
locking problem by backporting the removal of most of the feature.  Note
that even with the feature disabled, the lock would still be acquired
for any accesses to the VGA MMIO region."	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

If the system doesn't differentiate between an HMAC signed token and an RS/EC/PS signed token during verification, it becomes vulnerable to this kind of attack. For instance, an attacker could craft a token with the alg field set to ""HS256"" while the server expects an asymmetric algorithm like ""RS256"". The server might mistakenly use the wrong verification method, such as using a public key as the HMAC secret, leading to unauthorised access. For RSA, the key can be computed from a few signatures. For Elliptic Curve (EC), two potential keys can be recovered from one signature. This can be used to bypass the signature mechanism if an application relies on asymmetrically signed tokens. This issue has been addressed in version 2.3.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

CVE-2024-56159	2024-12-19T19:15:08.123	2024-12-20T21:15:09.940	Astro is a web framework for content-driven websites. A bug in the build process allows any unauthenticated user to read parts of the server source code. During build, along with client assets such as css and font files, the sourcemap files **for the server code** are moved to a publicly-accessible folder. Any outside party can read them with an unauthorized HTTP GET request to the same server hosting the rest of the website. While some server files are hashed, making their access obscure, the files corresponding to the file system router (those in `src/pages`) are predictably named. For example. the sourcemap file for `src/pages/index.astro` gets named `dist/client/pages/index.astro.mjs.map`. This vulnerability is the root cause of issue #12703, which links to a simple stackblitz project demonstrating the vulnerability. Upon build, notice the contents of the `dist/client` (referred to as `config.build.client` in astro code) folder. All astro servers make the folder in question accessible to the public internet without any authentication. It contains `.map` files corresponding to the code that runs on the server. All **server-output** projects on Astro 5 versions **v5.0.3** through **v5.0.7**, that have **sourcemaps enabled**, either directly or through an add-on such as `sentry`, are affected. The fix for **server-output** projects was released in **astro@5.0.8**. Additionally, all **static-output** projects built using Astro 4 versions **4.16.17 or older**, or Astro 5 versions **5.0.8 or older**, that have **sourcemaps enabled** are also affected. The fix for **static-output** projects was released in **astro@5.0.9**, and backported to Astro v4 in **astro@4.16.18**. The immediate impact is limited to source code. Any secrets or environment variables are not exposed unless they are present verbatim in the source code. There is no immediate loss of integrity within the the vulnerable server. However, it is possible to subsequently discover another vulnerability via the revealed source code . There is no immediate impact to availability of the vulnerable server. However, the presence of an unsafe regular expression, for example, can quickly be exploited to subsequently compromise the availability. The fix for **server-output** projects was released in **astro@5.0.8**, and the fix for **static-output** projects was released in **astro@5.0.9** and backported to Astro v4 in **astro@4.16.18**. Users are advised to update immediately if they are using sourcemaps or an integration that enables sourcemaps.

This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.1, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.33, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.97.
The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are 
known to be affected: 8.5.0 though 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions 
may also be affected.


The mitigation for CVE-2024-50379 was incomplete.

Users running Tomcat on a case insensitive file system with the default servlet write enabled (readonly initialisation 
parameter set to the non-default value of false) may need additional configuration to fully mitigate CVE-2024-50379 depending on which version of Java they are using with Tomcat:
- running on Java 8 or Java 11: the system property sun.io.useCanonCaches must be explicitly set to false (it defaults to true)
- running on Java 17: the system property sun.io.useCanonCaches, if set, must be set to false (it defaults to false)
- running on Java 21 onwards: no further configuration is required (the system property and the problematic cache have been removed)

Tomcat 11.0.3, 10.1.35 and 9.0.99 onwards will include checks that sun.io.useCanonCaches is set appropriately before allowing the default servlet to be write enabled on a case insensitive file system. Tomcat will also set sun.io.useCanonCaches to false by default where it can."	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2024-56331	2024-12-20T20:15:24.337	2024-12-20T20:15:24.337	"Uptime Kuma is an open source, self-hosted monitoring tool. An **Improper URL Handling Vulnerability** allows an attacker to access sensitive local files on the server by exploiting the `file:///` protocol. This vulnerability is triggered via the **""real-browser""** request type, which takes a screenshot of the URL provided by the attacker. By supplying local file paths, such as `file:///etc/passwd`, an attacker can read sensitive data from the server. This vulnerability arises because the system does not properly validate or sanitize the user input for the URL field. Specifically: 1. The URL input (`<input data-v-5f5c86d7="""" id=""url"" type=""url"" class=""form-control"" pattern=""https?://.+"" required="""">`) allows users to input arbitrary file paths, including those using the `file:///` protocol, without server-side validation. 2. The server then uses the user-provided URL to make a request, passing it to a browser instance that performs the ""real-browser"" request, which takes a screenshot of the content at the given URL. If a local file path is entered (e.g., `file:///etc/passwd`), the browser fetches and captures the file’s content. Since the user input is not validated, an attacker can manipulate the URL to request local files (e.g., `file:///etc/passwd`), and the system will capture a screenshot of the file's content, potentially exposing sensitive data. Any **authenticated user** who can submit a URL in ""real-browser"" mode is at risk of exposing sensitive data through screenshots of these files. This issue has been addressed in version 1.23.16 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."	6.8	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVE-2024-56335	2024-12-20T21:15:10.277	2025-08-19T13:46:58.837	vaultwarden is an unofficial Bitwarden compatible server written in Rust, formerly known as bitwarden_rs. In affected versions an attacker is capable of updating or deleting groups from an organization given a few conditions: 1. The attacker has a user account in the server. 2. The attacker's account has admin or owner permissions in an unrelated organization. 3. The attacker knows the target organization's UUID and the target group's UUID. Note that this vulnerability is related to group functionality and as such is only applicable for servers who have enabled the `ORG_GROUPS_ENABLED` setting, which is disabled by default. This attack can lead to different situations: 1. Denial of service, the attacker can limit users from accessing the organization's data by removing their membership from the group. 2. Privilege escalation, if the attacker is part of the victim organization, they can escalate their own privileges by joining a group they wouldn't normally have access to. For attackers that aren't part of the organization, this shouldn't lead to any possible plain-text data exfiltration as all the data is encrypted client side. This vulnerability is patched in Vaultwarden `1.32.7`, and users are recommended to update as soon as possible. If it's not possible to update to `1.32.7`,  some possible workarounds are: 1. Disabling `ORG_GROUPS_ENABLED`, which would disable groups functionality on the server. 2. Disabling `SIGNUPS_ALLOWED`, which would not allow an attacker to create new accounts on the server.	7.6	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L

In versions on the 3.x branch prior to 3.1.5, a bug in the Jinja compiler allows an attacker that controls both the content and filename of a template to execute arbitrary Python code, regardless of if Jinja's sandbox is used. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control both the filename and the contents of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates where the template author can also choose the template filename.

Prior to 3.1.5, An oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to store a reference to a malicious string's format method, then pass that to a filter that calls it. No such filters are built-in to Jinja, but could be present through custom filters in an application. After the fix, such indirect calls are also handled by the sandbox.

CVE-2024-53275	2024-12-23T18:15:07.143	2025-02-18T22:15:12.430	Home-Gallery.org is a self-hosted open-source web gallery to browse personal photos and videos. In 1.15.0 and earlier, the default setup of home-gallery is vulnerable to DNS rebinding. Home-gallery is set up without TLS and user authentication by default, leaving it vulnerable to DNS rebinding. In this attack, an attacker will ask a user to visit their website. The attacker website will then change the DNS records of their domain from their IP address to the internal IP address of the home-gallery instance. To tell which IP addresses are valid, we can rebind a subdomain to each IP address we want to check, and see if there is a response. Once potential candidates have been found, the attacker can launch the attack by reading the response of the web server after the IP address has changed. When the attacker domain is fetched, the response will be from the home-gallery instance, not the attacker website, because the IP address has been changed. Due to a lack of authentication, home-gallery photos can then be extracted by the attacker website.

In 1.15.0 and earlier, an open CORS policy in app.js may allow an attacker to view the images of home-gallery when it is using the default settings. The following express middleware allows any website to make a cross site request to home-gallery, thus allowing them to read any endpoint on home-gallery. Home-gallery is mostly safe from cross-site requests due to most of its pages requiring JavaScript, and cross-site requests such as fetch() do not render javascript. If an attacker is able to get the path of the preview images which are randomized, an attacker will be able to view such a photo. If any static files or endpoints are introduced in the future that contain sensitive information, they will be accessible to an attacker website.

In 1.0, there is a vulnerability in the web application's handling of user-supplied input that is incorporated into a Jinja2 template. Specifically, when user input is improperly sanitized or validated, an attacker can inject Jinja2 syntax into the template, causing the server to execute arbitrary code. For example, an attacker might be able to inject expressions like {{ config }}, {{ self.class.mro[1].subclasses() }}, or more dangerous payloads that trigger execution of arbitrary Python code. The vulnerability can be reproduced by submitting crafted input to all the template fields handled by ckeditor, that are passed directly to a Jinja2 template. If the input is rendered without sufficient sanitization, it results in the execution of malicious Jinja2 code on the server.	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

The current USB-audio driver code doesn't check bLength of each

might hit out-of-bounds reads.

For addressing it, this patch adds sanity checks to the validator

length is shorter than expected, it's skipped in the loop.

For the clock source and clock multiplier descriptors, we can just
check bLength against the sizeof() of each descriptor type.

PCI: tegra194: Move controller cleanups to pex_ep_event_pex_rst_deassert()

Currently, the endpoint cleanup function dw_pcie_ep_cleanup() and EPF
deinit notify function pci_epc_deinit_notify() are called during the
execution of pex_ep_event_pex_rst_assert() i.e., when the host has asserted
PERST#. But quickly after this step, refclk will also be disabled by the
host.

All of the tegra194 endpoint SoCs supported as of now depend on the refclk
from the host for keeping the controller operational. Due to this
limitation, any access to the hardware registers in the absence of refclk
will result in a whole endpoint crash. Unfortunately, most of the
controller cleanups require accessing the hardware registers (like eDMA
cleanup performed in dw_pcie_ep_cleanup(), etc...). So these cleanup
functions can cause the crash in the endpoint SoC once host asserts PERST#.

One way to address this issue is by generating the refclk in the endpoint
itself and not depending on the host. But that is not always possible as
some of the endpoint designs do require the endpoint to consume refclk from
the host.

Thus, fix this crash by moving the controller cleanups to the start of
the pex_ep_event_pex_rst_deassert() function. This function is called
whenever the host has deasserted PERST# and it is guaranteed that the
refclk would be active at this point. So at the start of this function

This issue affects MINA core versions 2.0.X, 2.1.X and 2.2.X, and will be fixed by the releases 2.0.27, 2.1.10 and 2.2.4.





It's also important to note that an application using MINA core library will only be affected if the IoBuffer#getObject() method is called, and this specific method is potentially called when adding a ProtocolCodecFilter instance using the ObjectSerializationCodecFactory class in the filter chain. If your application is specifically using those classes, you have to upgrade to the latest version of MINA core library.




Upgrading will  not be enough: you also need to explicitly allow the classes the decoder will accept in the ObjectSerializationDecoder instance, using one of the three new methods:




    /**

     * Accept class names where the supplied ClassNameMatcher matches for

     * deserialization, unless they are otherwise rejected.

     *

     * @param classNameMatcher the matcher to use

     */

    public void accept(ClassNameMatcher classNameMatcher)




    /**

     * Accept class names that match the supplied pattern for

     * deserialization, unless they are otherwise rejected.

     *

     * @param pattern standard Java regexp

     */

    public void accept(Pattern pattern) 





    /**

     * Accept the wildcard specified classes for deserialization,

     * unless they are otherwise rejected.

     *

     * @param patterns Wildcard file name patterns as defined by

     *                  {@link org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils#wildcardMatch(String, String) FilenameUtils.wildcardMatch}

     */

    public void accept(String... patterns)







By default, the decoder will reject *all* classes that will be present in the incoming data.

Reproduction script:

mkdir -p /mnt/nfsshare
mkdir -p /mnt/nfs/netns_1
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb
mount /dev/sdb /mnt/nfsshare
systemctl restart nfs-server
chmod 777 /mnt/nfsshare
exportfs -i -o rw,no_root_squash *:/mnt/nfsshare

ip netns add netns_1
ip link add name veth_1_peer type veth peer veth_1
ifconfig veth_1_peer 11.11.0.254 up
ip link set veth_1 netns netns_1
ip netns exec netns_1 ifconfig veth_1 11.11.0.1

ip netns exec netns_1 /root/iptables -A OUTPUT -d 11.11.0.254 -p tcp \
	--tcp-flags FIN FIN  -j DROP

(note: In my environment, a DESTROY_CLIENTID operation is always sent
 immediately, breaking the nfs tcp connection.)
ip netns exec netns_1 timeout -s 9 300 mount -t nfs -o proto=tcp,vers=4.1 \
	11.11.0.254:/mnt/nfsshare /mnt/nfs/netns_1

ip netns del netns_1

The reason here is that the tcp socket in netns_1 (nfs side) has been
shutdown and closed (done in xs_destroy), but the FIN message (with ack)
is discarded, and the nfsd side keeps sending retransmission messages.
As a result, when the tcp sock in netns_1 processes the received message,
it sends the message (FIN message) in the sending queue, and the tcp timer
is re-established. When the network namespace is deleted, the net structure
accessed by tcp's timer handler function causes problems.

To fix this problem, let's hold netns refcnt for the tcp kernel socket as
done in other modules. This is an ugly hack which can easily be backported
to earlier kernels. A proper fix which cleans up the interfaces will
follow, but may not be so easy to backport."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2024-53169	2024-12-27T14:15:24.057	2025-10-01T21:16:39.040	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme-fabrics: fix kernel crash while shutting down controller

The nvme keep-alive operation, which executes at a periodic interval,
could potentially sneak in while shutting down a fabric controller.
This may lead to a race between the fabric controller admin queue
destroy code path (invoked while shutting down controller) and hw/hctx
queue dispatcher called from the nvme keep-alive async request queuing
operation. This race could lead to the kernel crash shown below:

Call Trace:
    autoremove_wake_function+0x0/0xbc (unreliable)
    __blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests+0x114/0x24c
    blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests+0x44/0x84

    worker_thread+0x340/0x504
    kthread+0x138/0x140
    start_kernel_thread+0x14/0x18

While shutting down fabric controller, if nvme keep-alive request sneaks
in then it would be flushed off. The nvme_keep_alive_end_io function is
then invoked to handle the end of the keep-alive operation which
decrements the admin->q_usage_counter and assuming this is the last/only
request in the admin queue then the admin->q_usage_counter becomes zero.
If that happens then blk-mq destroy queue operation (blk_mq_destroy_
queue()) which could be potentially running simultaneously on another
cpu (as this is the controller shutdown code path) would forward
progress and deletes the admin queue. So, now from this point onward
we are not supposed to access the admin queue resources. However the
issue here's that the nvme keep-alive thread running hw/hctx queue
dispatch operation hasn't yet finished its work and so it could still
potentially access the admin queue resource while the admin queue had
been already deleted and that causes the above crash.

The above kernel crash is regression caused due to changes implemented
in commit a54a93d0e359 (""nvme: move stopping keep-alive into
nvme_uninit_ctrl()""). Ideally we should stop keep-alive before destroyin
g the admin queue and freeing the admin tagset so that it wouldn't sneak
in during the shutdown operation. However we removed the keep alive stop
operation from the beginning of the controller shutdown code path in commit
a54a93d0e359 (""nvme: move stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl()"")
and added it under nvme_uninit_ctrl() which executes very late in the
shutdown code path after the admin queue is destroyed and its tagset is
removed. So this change created the possibility of keep-alive sneaking in
and interfering with the shutdown operation and causing observed kernel
crash.

To fix the observed crash, we decided to move nvme_stop_keep_alive() from
nvme_uninit_ctrl() to nvme_remove_admin_tag_set(). This change would ensure
that we don't forward progress and delete the admin queue until the keep-
alive operation is finished (if it's in-flight) or cancelled and that would
help contain the race condition explained above and hence avoid the crash.

Moving nvme_stop_keep_alive() to nvme_remove_admin_tag_set() instead of
adding nvme_stop_keep_alive() to the beginning of the controller shutdown
code path in nvme_stop_ctrl(), as was the case earlier before commit
a54a93d0e359 (""nvme: move stopping keep-alive into nvme_uninit_ctrl()""),
would help save one callsite of nvme_stop_keep_alive()."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

ubifs: authentication: Fix use-after-free in ubifs_tnc_end_commit

After an insertion in TNC, the tree might split and cause a node to
change its `znode->parent`. A further deletion of other nodes in the
tree (which also could free the nodes), the aforementioned node's
`znode->cparent` could still point to a freed node. This
`znode->cparent` may not be updated when getting nodes to commit in
`ubifs_tnc_start_commit()`. This could then trigger a use-after-free

This can be triggered by running

  rm -f /etc/test-file.bin

The offending `memcpy()` in `ubifs_copy_hash()` has a use-after-free
when a node becomes root in TNC but still has a `cparent` to an already
freed node. More specifically, consider the following TNC:

         zroot
         /
        /
      zp1
      /
     /
    zn

Inserting a new node `zn_new` with a key smaller then `zn` will trigger
a split in `tnc_insert()` if `zp1` is full:

         zroot
         /   \
        /     \
      zp1     zp2
      /         \
     /           \
  zn_new          zn

`zn->parent` has now been moved to `zp2`, *but* `zn->cparent` still
points to `zp1`.

Now, consider a removal of all the nodes _except_ `zn`. Just when
`tnc_delete()` is about to delete `zroot` and `zp2`:

         zroot
             \
              \
              zp2
                \
                 \
                 zn

`zroot` and `zp2` get freed and the tree collapses:

           zn

`zn` now becomes the new `zroot`.

`get_znodes_to_commit()` will now only find `zn`, the new `zroot`, and
`write_index()` will check its `znode->cparent` that wrongly points to
the already freed `zp1`. `ubifs_copy_hash()` thus gets wrongly called
with `znode->cparent->zbranch[znode->iip].hash` that triggers the
use-after-free!

Fix this by explicitly setting `znode->cparent` to `NULL` in
`get_znodes_to_commit()` for the root node. The search for the dirty
nodes

smb: During unmount, ensure all cached dir instances drop their dentry

The unmount process (cifs_kill_sb() calling close_all_cached_dirs()) can
race with various cached directory operations, which ultimately results
in dentries not being dropped and these kernel BUGs:

BUG: Dentry ffff88814f37e358{i=1000000000080,n=/}  still in use (2) [unmount of cifs cifs]

kernel BUG at fs/super.c:661!

This happens when a cfid is in the process of being cleaned up when, and
has been removed from the cfids->entries list, including:

- Receiving a lease break from the server
- Server reconnection triggers invalidate_all_cached_dirs(), which
  removes all the cfids from the list
- The laundromat thread decides to expire an old cfid.

To solve these problems, dropping the dentry is done in queued work done
in a newly-added cfid_put_wq workqueue, and close_all_cached_dirs()
flushes that workqueue after it drops all the dentries of which it's
aware. This is a global workqueue (rather than scoped to a mount), but
the queued work is minimal.

The final cleanup work for cleaning up a cfid is performed via work
queued in the serverclose_wq workqueue; this is done separate from
dropping the dentries so that close_all_cached_dirs() doesn't block on
any server operations.

Both of these queued works expect to invoked with a cfid reference and
a tcon reference to avoid those objects from being freed while the work
is ongoing.

While we're here, add proper locking to close_all_cached_dirs(), and
locking around the freeing of cfid->dentry."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Update open_cached_dir() to drop refs rather than directly freeing the

Have cached_dir_lease_break(), cfids_laundromat_worker(), and
invalidate_all_cached_dirs() clear has_lease immediately while still
holding cfids->cfid_list_lock, and then use this to also simplify the
reference counting in cfids_laundromat_worker() and

smb: Don't leak cfid when reconnect races with open_cached_dir

open_cached_dir() may either race with the tcon reconnection even before
compound_send_recv() or directly trigger a reconnection via
SMB2_open_init() or SMB_query_info_init().

The reconnection process invokes invalidate_all_cached_dirs() via
cifs_mark_open_files_invalid(), which removes all cfids from the
cfids->entries list but doesn't drop a ref if has_lease isn't true. This
results in the currently-being-constructed cfid not being on the list,
but still having a refcount of 2. It leaks if returned from
open_cached_dir().

Fix this by setting cfid->has_lease when the ref is actually taken; the
cfid will not be used by other threads until it has a valid time.

smb: client: fix use-after-free of signing key

Customers have reported use-after-free in @ses->auth_key.response with
SMB2.1 + sign mounts which occurs due to following race:

task A                         task B
cifs_mount()
 dfs_mount_share()
  get_session()
   cifs_mount_get_session()    cifs_send_recv()
    cifs_get_smb_ses()          compound_send_recv()
     cifs_setup_session()        smb2_setup_request()
      kfree_sensitive()           smb2_calc_signature()
                                   crypto_shash_setkey() *UAF*

Fix this by ensuring that we have a valid @ses->auth_key.response by
checking whether @ses->ses_status is SES_GOOD or SES_EXITING with
@ses->ses_lock held.  After commit 24a9799aa8ef (""smb: client: fix UAF
in smb2_reconnect_server()""), we made sure to call ->logoff() only
when @ses was known to be good (e.g. valid ->auth_key.response), so
it's safe to access signing key when @ses->ses_status == SES_EXITING."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

ksmbd: fix use-after-free in SMB request handling

A race condition exists between SMB request handling in
`ksmbd_conn_handler_loop()` and the freeing of `ksmbd_conn` in the
workqueue handler `handle_ksmbd_work()`. This leads to a UAF.
- KASAN: slab-use-after-free Read in handle_ksmbd_work
- KASAN: slab-use-after-free in rtlock_slowlock_locked

This race condition arises as follows:
- `ksmbd_conn_handler_loop()` waits for `conn->r_count` to reach zero:
  `wait_event(conn->r_count_q, atomic_read(&conn->r_count) == 0);`
- Meanwhile, `handle_ksmbd_work()` decrements `conn->r_count` using
  `atomic_dec_return(&conn->r_count)`, and if it reaches zero, calls
  `ksmbd_conn_free()`, which frees `conn`.
- However, after `handle_ksmbd_work()` decrements `conn->r_count`,
  it may still access `conn->r_count_q` in the following line:
  `waitqueue_active(&conn->r_count_q)` or `wake_up(&conn->r_count_q)`
  This results in a UAF, as `conn` has already been freed.

wifi: rtlwifi: Drastically reduce the attempts to read efuse in case of failures

Syzkaller reported a hung task with uevent_show() on stack trace. That
specific issue was addressed by another commit [0], but even with that
fix applied (for example, running v6.12-rc5) we face another type of hung
task that comes from the same reproducer [1]. By investigating that, we
could narrow it to the following path:

(a) Syzkaller emulates a Realtek USB WiFi adapter using raw-gadget and
dummy_hcd infrastructure.

(b) During the probe of rtl8192cu, the driver ends-up performing an efuse
read procedure (which is related to EEPROM load IIUC), and here lies the
issue: the function read_efuse() calls read_efuse_byte() many times, as
loop iterations depending on the efuse size (in our example, 512 in total).

This procedure for reading efuse bytes relies in a loop that performs an
I/O read up to *10k* times in case of failures. We measured the time of
the loop inside read_efuse_byte() alone, and in this reproducer (which
involves the dummy_hcd emulation layer), it takes 15 seconds each. As a
consequence, we have the driver stuck in its probe routine for big time,
exposing a stack trace like below if we attempt to reboot the system, for
example:

 [...]

We propose hereby to drastically reduce the attempts of doing the I/O
reads in case of failures, restricted to USB devices (given that
they're inherently slower than PCIe ones). By retrying up to 10 times
(instead of 10000), we got reponsiveness in the reproducer, while seems
reasonable to believe that there's no sane USB device implementation in
the field requiring this amount of retries at every I/O read in order
to properly work. Based on that assumption, it'd be good to have it
backported to stable but maybe not since driver implementation (the 10k
number comes from day 0), perhaps up to 6.x series makes sense.

clk: clk-loongson2: Fix potential buffer overflow in flexible-array member access

Flexible-array member `hws` in `struct clk_hw_onecell_data` is annotated
with the `counted_by()` attribute. This means that when memory is
allocated for this array, the _counter_, which in this case is member
`num` in the flexible structure, should be set to the maximum number of
elements the flexible array can contain, or fewer.

In this case, the total number of elements for the flexible array is
determined by variable `clks_num` when allocating heap space via
`devm_kzalloc()`, as shown below:

289         struct loongson2_clk_provider *clp;
	...
296         for (p = data; p->name; p++)
297                 clks_num++;

300                            GFP_KERNEL);

So, `clp->clk_data.num` should be set to `clks_num` or less, and not
exceed `clks_num`, as is currently the case. Otherwise, if data is
written into `clp->clk_data.hws[clks_num]`, the instrumentation
provided by the compiler won't detect the overflow, leading to a
memory corruption bug at runtime.

Fix this issue by setting `clp->clk_data.num` to `clks_num`."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

clk: clk-loongson2: Fix memory corruption bug in struct loongson2_clk_provider

Some heap space is allocated for the flexible structure `struct
clk_hw_onecell_data` and its flexible-array member `hws` through
the composite structure `struct loongson2_clk_provider` in function
`loongson2_clk_probe()`, as shown below:

289         struct loongson2_clk_provider *clp;
	...
296         for (p = data; p->name; p++)
297                 clks_num++;

300                            GFP_KERNEL);

Then some data is written into the flexible array:

350                 clp->clk_data.hws[p->id] = hw;

This corrupts `clk_lock`, which is the spinlock variable immediately
following the `clk_data` member in `struct loongson2_clk_provider`:

struct loongson2_clk_provider {
	void __iomem *base;
	struct device *dev;
	struct clk_hw_onecell_data clk_data;
	spinlock_t clk_lock;	/* protect access to DIV registers */
};

The problem is that the flexible structure is currently placed in the
middle of `struct loongson2_clk_provider` instead of at the end.

Fix this by moving `struct clk_hw_onecell_data clk_data;` to the end of
`struct loongson2_clk_provider`. Also, add a code comment to help
prevent this from happening again in case new members are added to the
structure in the future.

PCI: Fix use-after-free of slot->bus on hot remove

Dennis reports a boot crash on recent Lenovo laptops with a USB4 dock.

Since commit 0fc70886569c (""thunderbolt: Reset USB4 v2 host router"") and
commit 59a54c5f3dbd (""thunderbolt: Reset topology created by the boot
firmware""), USB4 v2 and v1 Host Routers are reset on probe of the
thunderbolt driver.

The reset clears the Presence Detect State and Data Link Layer Link Active
bits at the USB4 Host Router's Root Port and thus causes hot removal of the
dock.

The crash occurs when pciehp is unbound from one of the dock's Downstream
Ports:  pciehp creates a pci_slot on bind and destroys it on unbind.  The
pci_slot contains a pointer to the pci_bus below the Downstream Port, but
a reference on that pci_bus is never acquired.  The pci_bus is destroyed
before the pci_slot, so a use-after-free ensues when pci_slot_release()
accesses slot->bus.

In principle this should not happen because pci_stop_bus_device() unbinds
pciehp (and therefore destroys the pci_slot) before the pci_bus is
destroyed by pci_remove_bus_device().

However the stacktrace provided by Dennis shows that pciehp is unbound from
pci_remove_bus_device() instead of pci_stop_bus_device().  To understand
the significance of this, one needs to know that the PCI core uses a two
step process to remove a portion of the hierarchy:  It first unbinds all
drivers in the sub-hierarchy in pci_stop_bus_device() and then actually
removes the devices in pci_remove_bus_device().  There is no precaution to
prevent driver binding in-between pci_stop_bus_device() and
pci_remove_bus_device().

In Dennis' case, it seems removal of the hierarchy by pciehp races with
driver binding by pci_bus_add_devices().  pciehp is bound to the
Downstream Port after pci_stop_bus_device() has run, so it is unbound by
pci_remove_bus_device() instead of pci_stop_bus_device().  Because the
pci_bus has already been destroyed at that point, accesses to it result in
a use-after-free.

One might conclude that driver binding needs to be prevented after
pci_stop_bus_device() has run.  However it seems risky that pci_slot points
to pci_bus without holding a reference.  Solely relying on correct ordering
of driver unbind versus pci_bus destruction is certainly not defensive
programming.

If pci_slot has a need to access data in pci_bus, it ought to acquire a
reference.  Amend pci_create_slot() accordingly.  Dennis reports that the
crash is not reproducible with this change.

The following sequence led to the scenario:
 - Userspace creates a VM and a vCPU.
 - The vCPU is initialized with KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3 during
   KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT.
 - Without any other setup, such as vGIC or vPMU, userspace issues
   KVM_RUN on the vCPU. Since the vPMU is requested, but not setup,
   kvm_arm_pmu_v3_enable() fails in kvm_arch_vcpu_run_pid_change().
   As a result, KVM_RUN returns after enabling the timer, but before
   incrementing 'userspace_irqchip_in_use':
   kvm_arch_vcpu_run_pid_change()
       ret = kvm_arm_pmu_v3_enable()
           if (!vcpu->arch.pmu.created)
               return -EINVAL;
       if (ret)
           return ret;
       [...]
       if (!irqchip_in_kernel(kvm))
           static_branch_inc(&userspace_irqchip_in_use);
 - Userspace ignores the error and issues KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT again.
   Since the timer is already enabled, control moves through the
   following flow, ultimately hitting the WARN_ON():
   kvm_timer_vcpu_reset()
       if (timer->enabled)
          kvm_timer_update_irq()
              if (!userspace_irqchip())
                  ret = kvm_vgic_inject_irq()
                      ret = vgic_lazy_init()
                          if (unlikely(!vgic_initialized(kvm)))
                              if (kvm->arch.vgic.vgic_model !=
                                  KVM_DEV_TYPE_ARM_VGIC_V2)
                                      return -EBUSY;
                  WARN_ON(ret);

Theoretically, since userspace_irqchip_in_use's functionality can be
simply replaced by '!irqchip_in_kernel()', get rid of the static key
to avoid the mismanagement, which also helps with the syzbot issue."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

KVM: arm64: Don't retire aborted MMIO instruction

Returning an abort to the guest for an unsupported MMIO access is a
documented feature of the KVM UAPI. Nevertheless, it's clear that this
plumbing has seen limited testing, since userspace can trivially cause a
WARN in the MMIO return:

The splat is complaining that KVM is advancing PC while an exception is
pending, i.e. that KVM is retiring the MMIO instruction despite a
pending synchronous external abort. Womp womp.

Fix the glaring UAPI bug by skipping over all the MMIO emulation in
case there is a pending synchronous exception. Note that while userspace
is capable of pending an asynchronous exception (SError, IRQ, or FIQ),
it is still safe to retire the MMIO instruction in this case as (1) they
are by definition asynchronous, and (2) KVM relies on hardware support
for pending/delivering these exceptions instead of the software state
machine for advancing PC."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

xen: Fix the issue of resource not being properly released in xenbus_dev_probe()

This patch fixes an issue in the function xenbus_dev_probe(). In the
xenbus_dev_probe() function, within the if (err) branch at line 313, the
program incorrectly returns err directly without releasing the resources
allocated by err = drv->probe(dev, id). As the return value is non-zero,
the upper layers assume the processing logic has failed. However, the probe
operation was performed earlier without a corresponding remove operation.
Since the probe actually allocates resources, failing to perform the remove
operation could lead to problems.

To fix this issue, we followed the resource release logic of the
xenbus_dev_remove() function by adding a new block fail_remove before the
fail_put block. After entering the branch if (err) at line 313, the
function will use a goto statement to jump to the fail_remove block,
ensuring that the previously acquired resources are correctly released,
thus preventing the reference count leak.

This bug was identified by an experimental static analysis tool developed
by our team. The tool specializes in analyzing reference count operations
and detecting potential issues where resources are not properly managed.
In this case, the tool flagged the missing release operation as a
potential problem, which led to the development of this patch."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Passing MSG_PEEK flag to skb_recv_datagram() increments skb refcount

This results in skb memory leak in skb_queue_purge() and WARN_ON in

By forcing memory allocation failures in idr_alloc_32, syzbot is able
to provoke a condition where idr_is_empty returns false despite there
being no items in the IDR. This turns out to be because the radix tree
of the IDR contains only internal radix-tree nodes and it is this that
causes idr_is_empty to return false. The internal nodes are cleaned by
idr_destroy.

Use idr_for_each to check that the IDR is empty instead of

netlink: fix false positive warning in extack during dumps

Commit under fixes extended extack reporting to dumps.
It works under normal conditions, because extack errors are
usually reported during ->start() or the first ->dump(),
it's quite rare that the dump starts okay but fails later.
If the dump does fail later, however, the input skb will
already have the initiating message pulled, so checking
if bad attr falls within skb->data will fail.

Switch the check to using nlh, which is always valid.

syzbot found a way to hit that scenario by filling up
the receive queue. In this case we initiate a dump
but don't call ->dump() until there is read space for
an skb.

In lan78xx_probe(), the buffer `buf` was being freed twice: once
implicitly through `usb_free_urb(dev->urb_intr)` with the

a double free issue.

To resolve this, reordered `kmalloc()` and `usb_alloc_urb()` calls to
simplify the initialization sequence and removed the redundant
`kfree(buf)`.  Now, `buf` is allocated after `usb_alloc_urb()`, ensuring

vfio/pci: Properly hide first-in-list PCIe extended capability

There are cases where a PCIe extended capability should be hidden from
the user. For example, an unknown capability (i.e., capability with ID
greater than PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_MAX) or a capability that is intentionally
chosen to be hidden from the user.

Hiding a capability is done by virtualizing and modifying the 'Next
Capability Offset' field of the previous capability so it points to the
capability after the one that should be hidden.

The special case where the first capability in the list should be hidden
is handled differently because there is no previous capability that can
be modified. In this case, the capability ID and version are zeroed
while leaving the next pointer intact. This hides the capability and
leaves an anchor for the rest of the capability list.

However, today, hiding the first capability in the list is not done
properly if the capability is unknown, as struct
vfio_pci_core_device->pci_config_map is set to the capability ID during
initialization but the capability ID is not properly checked later when
used in vfio_config_do_rw(). This leads to the following warning [1] and
to an out-of-bounds access to ecap_perms array.

Fix it by checking cap_id in vfio_config_do_rw(), and if it is greater
than PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_MAX, use an alternative struct perm_bits for direct
read only access instead of the ecap_perms array.

Note that this is safe since the above is the only case where cap_id can
exceed PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_MAX (except for the special capabilities, which
are already checked before).

The warning is triggered as follows:

1) syscall finit_module() handles the module insertion and it invokes
kernel_read_file() to read the content of the module first.

2) kernel_read_file() allocates a 10MB buffer by using vmalloc() and
passes it to kernel_read(). kernel_read() constructs a kvec iter by
using iov_iter_kvec() and passes it to fuse_file_read_iter().

3) virtio-fs disables the cache, so fuse_file_read_iter() invokes
fuse_direct_io(). As for now, the maximal read size for kvec iter is
only limited by fc->max_read. For virtio-fs, max_read is UINT_MAX, so
fuse_direct_io() doesn't split the 10MB buffer. It saves the address and
the size of the 10MB-sized buffer in out_args[0] of a fuse request and
passes the fuse request to virtio_fs_wake_pending_and_unlock().

4) virtio_fs_wake_pending_and_unlock() uses virtio_fs_enqueue_req() to
queue the request. Because virtiofs need DMA-able address, so
virtio_fs_enqueue_req() uses kmalloc() to allocate a bounce buffer for
all fuse args, copies these args into the bounce buffer and passed the
physical address of the bounce buffer to virtiofsd. The total length of
these fuse args for the passed fuse request is about 10MB, so
copy_args_to_argbuf() invokes kmalloc() with a 10MB size parameter and
it triggers the warning in __alloc_pages():

	if (WARN_ON_ONCE_GFP(order > MAX_PAGE_ORDER, gfp))
		return NULL;

5) virtio_fs_enqueue_req() will retry the memory allocation in a
kworker, but it won't help, because kmalloc() will always return NULL
due to the abnormal size and finit_module() will hang forever.

A feasible solution is to limit the value of max_read for virtio-fs, so
the length passed to kmalloc() will be limited. However it will affect
the maximal read size for normal read. And for virtio-fs write initiated
from kernel, it has the similar problem but now there is no way to limit
fc->max_write in kernel.

So instead of limiting both the values of max_read and max_write in
kernel, introducing use_pages_for_kvec_io in fuse_conn and setting it as
true in virtiofs. When use_pages_for_kvec_io is enabled, fuse will use
pages instead of pointer to pass the KVEC_IO data.

After switching to pages for KVEC_IO data, these pages will be used for
DMA through virtio-fs. If these pages are backed by vmalloc(),
{flush|invalidate}_kernel_vmap_range() are necessary to flush or
invalidate the cache before the DMA operation. So add two new fields in
fuse_args_pages to record the base address of vmalloc area and the
condition indicating whether invalidation is needed. Perform the flush
in fuse_get_user_pages() for write operations and the invalidation in
fuse_release_user_pages() for read operations.

The root cause is if checkpoint_disabling and lfs_mode are both on,
it will trigger OPU for all overwritten data, it may cost more free
segment than expected, so f2fs must account those data correctly to
calculate cosumed free segments later, and return ENOSPC earlier to
avoid run out of free segment during block allocation.

This fixes a crash when surprise hot-unplugging a PCI device. This crash
happens because during hot-unplug __iommu_group_set_domain_nofail()
attaching the default domain fails when the platform no longer
recognizes the device as it has already been removed and we end up with
a NULL domain pointer and UAF. This is exactly the case referred to in
the second comment in __iommu_device_set_domain() and just as stated
there if we can instead attach the blocking domain the UAF is prevented

For example, in the get_tree_bdev_flags function,when

Commit 24de1b7b231c (""wifi: ath12k: fix flush failure in recovery
scenarios"") added the change to decrement the pending packets count
in case of recovery which make sense as ah->hw as well all
ar's in it are intact during recovery, but during core deinit there
is no use in decrementing packets count or waking up the empty waitq
as the module is going to be removed also ar's from pending skb's
can't be used and the packets should just be released back.

To fix this, avoid accessing ar from skb->cb when driver is being
unregistered.

And the issue seems to be that the corresponding devres group is not
allocated. Normally, devres_open_group() is called from
__hid_device_probe() but Hyper-V HID driver overrides 'hid_dev->driver'
with 'mousevsc_hid_driver' stub and basically re-implements
__hid_device_probe() by calling hid_parse() and hid_hw_start() but not
devres_open_group(). hid_device_probe() does not call __hid_device_probe()
for it. Later, when the driver is removed, hid_device_remove() calls
devres_release_group() as it doesn't check whether hdev->driver was
initially overridden or not.

The issue seems to be related to the commit 62c68e7cee33 (""HID: ensure
timely release of driver-allocated resources"") but the commit itself seems
to be correct.

Fix the issue by dropping the 'hid_dev->driver' override and using
hid_register_driver()/hid_unregister_driver() instead. Alternatively, it
would have been possible to rely on the default handling but
HID_CONNECT_DEFAULT implies HID_CONNECT_HIDRAW and it doesn't seem to work
for mousevsc as-is."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

The above scenario will not only trigger a WARN_ON_ONCE(), but also
trigger a deadlock.

Thanks to nocb locking, a second racing rcu_barrier() on an offline CPU
will either observe the decremented callback counter down to 0 and spare
the callback enqueue, or rcuo will observe the new callback and keep
rdp->nocb_cb_sleep to false.

Therefore check rdp->nocb_cb_sleep before parking to make sure no
further rcu_barrier() is waiting on the rdp."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2024-56548	2024-12-27T14:15:34.603	2025-10-01T20:17:27.087	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hfsplus: don't query the device logical block size multiple times

Devices block sizes may change. One of these cases is a loop device by
using ioctl LOOP_SET_BLOCK_SIZE.

While this may cause other issues like IO being rejected, in the case of
hfsplus, it will allocate a block by using that size and potentially write
out-of-bounds when hfsplus_read_wrapper calls hfsplus_submit_bio and the
latter function reads a different io_size.

Using a new min_io_size initally set to sb_min_blocksize works for the
purposes of the original fix, since it will be set to the max between
HFSPLUS_SECTOR_SIZE and the first seen logical block size. We still use the
max between HFSPLUS_SECTOR_SIZE and min_io_size in case the latter is not
initialized.

Tested by mounting an hfsplus filesystem with loop block sizes 512, 1024
and 4096.

The produced KASAN report before the fix looks like this:

It looks like we try to suspend the queue (opcode=3), setting
suspend_pending and triggering a disable_scheduling. The user then
closes the queue. However the close will also forcefully signal the
suspend fence after killing the queue, later when the G2H response for
disable_scheduling comes back we have now cleared suspend_pending when
signalling the suspend fence, so the disable_scheduling now incorrectly
tries to also deregister the queue. This leads to warnings since the queue
has yet to even be marked for destruction. We also seem to trigger
errors later with trying to double unregister the same queue.

To fix this tweak the ordering when handling the response to ensure we
don't race with a disable_scheduling that didn't actually intend to
perform an unregister.  The destruction path should now also correctly
wait for any pending_disable before marking as destroyed.

Debugging Analysis:

  1. The following ftrace log shows that the lockup CPU spends too much
     time iterating vmap_nodes and flushing TLB when purging vm_area
     structures. (Some info is trimmed).

     kworker: funcgraph_entry:              |  drain_vmap_area_work() {
     kworker: funcgraph_entry:              |   mutex_lock() {
     kworker: funcgraph_entry:  1.092 us    |     __cond_resched();
     kworker: funcgraph_exit:   3.306 us    |   }
     ...                                        ...
     kworker: funcgraph_entry:              |    flush_tlb_kernel_range() {
     ...                                          ...
     kworker: funcgraph_exit: # 7533.649 us |    }
     ...                                         ...
     kworker: funcgraph_entry:  2.344 us    |   mutex_unlock();
     kworker: funcgraph_exit: $ 23871554 us | }

     The drain_vmap_area_work() spends over 23 seconds.

     There are 2805 flush_tlb_kernel_range() calls in the ftrace log.
       * One is called in __purge_vmap_area_lazy().
       * Others are called by purge_vmap_node->kasan_release_vmalloc.
         purge_vmap_node() iteratively releases kasan vmalloc
         allocations and flushes TLB for each vmap_area.
           - [Rough calculation] Each flush_tlb_kernel_range() runs
             about 7.5ms.
               -- 2804 * 7.5ms = 21.03 seconds.
               -- That's why a soft lock is triggered.

The minimal alignment of an integral type may differ from its size,
hence is not safe to assume that an arbitrary freeptr_t (which is
basically an unsigned long) is always aligned to 4 or 8 bytes.

As nothing seems to require the additional alignment, it is safe to fix
this by relaxing the check to the actual minimum alignment of freeptr_t."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

mm/slub: Avoid list corruption when removing a slab from the full list

Boot with slub_debug=UFPZ.

If allocated object failed in alloc_consistency_checks, all objects of
the slab will be marked as used, and then the slab will be removed from
the partial list.

When an object belonging to the slab got freed later, the remove_full()
function is called. Because the slab is neither on the partial list nor
on the full list, it eventually lead to a list corruption (actually a
list poison being detected).

So we need to mark and isolate the slab page with metadata corruption,
do not put it back in circulation.

Because the debug caches avoid all the fastpaths, reusing the frozen bit
to mark slab page with metadata corruption seems to be fine.

iommu/arm-smmu: Defer probe of clients after smmu device bound

Null pointer dereference occurs due to a race between smmu
driver probe and client driver probe, when of_dma_configure()
for client is called after the iommu_device_register() for smmu driver
probe has executed but before the driver_bound() for smmu driver
has been called.

Following is how the race occurs:

T1:Smmu device probe		T2: Client device probe

really_probe()
arm_smmu_device_probe()
iommu_device_register()
					really_probe()
					platform_dma_configure()
					of_dma_configure()
					of_dma_configure_id()
					of_iommu_configure()
					iommu_probe_device()
					iommu_init_device()
					arm_smmu_probe_device()
					arm_smmu_get_by_fwnode()
						driver_find_device_by_fwnode()
						driver_find_device()
						next_device()
						klist_next()
						    /* null ptr
						       assigned to smmu */
					/* null ptr dereference
					   while smmu->streamid_mask */
driver_bound()
	klist_add_tail()

When this null smmu pointer is dereferenced later in
arm_smmu_probe_device, the device crashes.

Fix this by deferring the probe of the client device
until the smmu device has bound to the arm smmu driver.

There is a chance to meet runtime issues during configuration of CAMSS

a platform CAMCC driver is simply not built.

btrfs: ref-verify: fix use-after-free after invalid ref action

At btrfs_ref_tree_mod() after we successfully inserted the new ref entry
(local variable 'ref') into the respective block entry's rbtree (local
variable 'be'), if we find an unexpected action of BTRFS_DROP_DELAYED_REF,
we error out and free the ref entry without removing it from the block
entry's rbtree. Then in the error path of btrfs_ref_tree_mod() we call
btrfs_free_ref_cache(), which iterates over all block entries and then
calls free_block_entry() for each one, and there we will trigger a
use-after-free when we are called against the block entry to which we
added the freed ref entry to its rbtree, since the rbtree still points
to the block entry, as we didn't remove it from the rbtree before freeing
it in the error path at btrfs_ref_tree_mod(). Fix this by removing the
new ref entry from the rbtree before freeing it.

The root cause is: creating large files during disable checkpoint
period results in not enough free segments, so when writing back root
inode will failed in f2fs_enable_checkpoint. When umount the file
system after enabling checkpoint, the root inode is dirty in
f2fs_evict_inode function, which triggers BUG_ON. The steps to
reproduce are as follows:

dd if=/dev/zero of=f2fs.img bs=1M count=55
mount f2fs.img f2fs_dir -o checkpoint=disable:10%
dd if=/dev/zero of=big bs=1M count=50

This is because in the hisi_sas driver, both the hardware interrupt
handler and the interrupt thread are executed on the same CPU. In the
performance test scenario, function irq_wait_for_interrupt() will always
return 0 if lots of interrupts occurs and the CPU will be continuously
consumed. As a result, the CPU cannot run the watchdog thread. When the
watchdog time exceeds the specified time, call trace occurs.

To fix it, add cond_resched() to execute the watchdog thread."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

One way to fix the lockdep warning is using raw_spinlock_t for
map_idr_lock as well. However, bpf_map_alloc_id() invokes
idr_alloc_cyclic() after acquiring map_idr_lock, it will trigger a
similar lockdep warning because the slab's lock (s->cpu_slab->lock) is
still a spinlock.

Instead of changing map_idr_lock's type, fix the issue by invoking
htab_put_fd_value() after htab_unlock_bucket(). However, only deferring
the invocation of htab_put_fd_value() is not enough, because the old map
pointers in htab of maps can not be saved during batched deletion.
Therefore, also defer the invocation of free_htab_elem(), so these
to-be-freed elements could be linked together similar to lru map.

There are four callers for ->map_fd_put_ptr:

(1) alloc_htab_elem() (through htab_put_fd_value())
It invokes ->map_fd_put_ptr() under a raw_spinlock_t. The invocation of
htab_put_fd_value() can not simply move after htab_unlock_bucket(),
because the old element has already been stashed in htab->extra_elems.
It may be reused immediately after htab_unlock_bucket() and the
invocation of htab_put_fd_value() after htab_unlock_bucket() may release
the newly-added element incorrectly. Therefore, saving the map pointer
of the old element for htab of maps before unlocking the bucket and
releasing the map_ptr after unlock. Beside the map pointer in the old
element, should do the same thing for the special fields in the old
element as well.

(2) free_htab_elem() (through htab_put_fd_value())
Its caller includes __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_elem(),
htab_map_delete_elem() and __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_batch().

For htab_map_delete_elem(), simply invoke free_htab_elem() after
htab_unlock_bucket(). For __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_batch(), just
like lru map, linking the to-be-freed element into node_to_free list
and invoking free_htab_elem() for these element after unlock. It is safe
to reuse batch_flink as the link for node_to_free, because these
elements have been removed from the hash llist.

Because htab of maps doesn't support lookup_and_delete operation,
__htab_map_lookup_and_delete_elem() doesn't have the problem, so kept
it as

wifi: brcmfmac: Fix oops due to NULL pointer dereference in brcmf_sdiod_sglist_rw()

This patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference bug in brcmfmac that occurs
when a high 'sd_sgentry_align' value applies (e.g. 512) and a lot of queued SKBs
are sent from the pkt queue.

The problem is the number of entries in the pre-allocated sgtable, it is
nents = max(rxglom_size, txglom_size) + max(rxglom_size, txglom_size) >> 4 + 1.
Given the default [rt]xglom_size=32 it's actually 35 which is too small.
Worst case, the pkt queue can end up with 64 SKBs. This occurs when a new SKB
is added for each original SKB if tailroom isn't enough to hold tail_pad.
At least one sg entry is needed for each SKB. So, eventually the ""skb_queue_walk loop""
in brcmf_sdiod_sglist_rw may run out of sg entries. This makes sg_next return
NULL and this causes the oops.

The patch sets nents to max(rxglom_size, txglom_size) * 2 to be able handle
the worst-case.
Btw. this requires only 64-35=29 * 16 (or 20 if CONFIG_NEED_SG_DMA_LENGTH) = 464

This is because during 'rmmod ath10k', ath10k_sdio_remove() will call
ath10k_core_destroy() before destroy_workqueue(). wiphy_dev_release()
will finally be called in ath10k_core_destroy(). This function will free
struct cfg80211_registered_device *rdev and all its members, including
wiphy, dev and the pointer of sdio workqueue. Then the pointer of sdio
workqueue will be set to NULL due to CONFIG_INIT_ON_FREE_DEFAULT_ON.

After device release, destroy_workqueue() will use NULL pointer then the
kernel panic happen.

Call trace:
ath10k_sdio_remove
  ->ath10k_core_unregister
    ……
    ->ath10k_core_stop
      ->ath10k_hif_stop
        ->ath10k_sdio_irq_disable

      ->ieee80211_free_hw
        ->wiphy_free
    ……
          ->wiphy_dev_release
  ->destroy_workqueue

Need to call destroy_workqueue() before ath10k_core_destroy(), free
the work queue buffer first and then free pointer of work queue by
ath10k_core_destroy(). This order matches the error path order in
ath10k_sdio_probe().

No work will be queued on sdio workqueue between it is destroyed and
ath10k_core_destroy() is called. Based on the call_stack above, the
reason is:
Only ath10k_sdio_sleep_timer_handler(), ath10k_sdio_hif_tx_sg() and
ath10k_sdio_irq_disable() will queue work on sdio workqueue.
Sleep timer will be deleted before ath10k_core_destroy() in
ath10k_hif_power_down().
ath10k_sdio_irq_disable() only be called in ath10k_hif_stop().
ath10k_core_unregister() will call ath10k_hif_power_down() to stop hif
bus, so ath10k_sdio_hif_tx_sg() won't be called anymore.

When I try to manually set bitrates:

I get sleeping from invalid context error, see below. Fix that by switching to
use recently introduced ieee80211_iterate_stations_mtx().

Do note that WCN6855 firmware is still crashing, I'm not sure if that firmware
even supports bitrate WMI commands and should we consider disabling
ath12k_mac_op_set_bitrate_mask() for WCN6855? But that's for another patch.

drm/amd/display: Fix out-of-bounds access in 'dcn21_link_encoder_create'

An issue was identified in the dcn21_link_encoder_create function where
an out-of-bounds access could occur when the hpd_source index was used
to reference the link_enc_hpd_regs array. This array has a fixed size
and the index was not being checked against the array's bounds before
accessing it.

This fix adds a conditional check to ensure that the hpd_source index is
within the valid range of the link_enc_hpd_regs array. If the index is
out of bounds, the function now returns NULL to prevent undefined
behavior.

On a detected data race, KCSAN's reporting logic checks if it should
filter the report. That list is protected by the report_filterlist_lock
*non-raw* spinlock which may sleep on RT kernels.

Since KCSAN may report data races in any context, convert it to a
raw_spinlock.

This requires being careful about when to allocate memory for the filter
list itself which can be done via KCSAN's debugfs interface. Concurrent
modification of the filter list via debugfs should be rare: the chosen
strategy is to optimistically pre-allocate memory before the critical
section and discard if unused."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

We currently assume that there is at least one VMA in a MM, which isn't

So we might end up having find_vma() return NULL, to then de-reference
NULL.  So properly handle find_vma() returning NULL.

mm/gup: handle NULL pages in unpin_user_pages()

flaw: it assumes that unpin_user_pages() handles NULL pages in the pages**

Fix this by skipping NULL pages in unpin_user_pages(), just like
unpin_folios() already does.

sched/numa: fix memory leak due to the overwritten vma->numab_state

  ...

This issue can be consistently reproduced on three different servers:
  * a 448-core server
  * a 256-core server
  * a 192-core server

[Root Cause]
Since multiple threads are created by the hackbench program (along with
the command argument 'thread'), a shared vma might be accessed by two or
more cores simultaneously. When two or more cores observe that
vma->numab_state is NULL at the same time, vma->numab_state will be
overwritten.

Although current code ensures that only one thread scans the VMAs in a
single 'numa_scan_period', there might be a chance for another thread
to enter in the next 'numa_scan_period' while we have not gotten till
numab_state allocation [1].

Note that the command `/opt/ltp/testcases/bin/hackbench 50 process 1000`
cannot the reproduce the issue. It is verified with 200+ test runs.

[Solution]
Use the cmpxchg atomic operation to ensure that only one thread executes
the vma->numab_state assignment.

xsk: fix OOB map writes when deleting elements

Jordy says:

""
In the xsk_map_delete_elem function an unsigned integer
(map->max_entries) is compared with a user-controlled signed integer
(k). Due to implicit type conversion, a large unsigned value for
map->max_entries can bypass the intended bounds check:

	if (k >= map->max_entries)
		return -EINVAL;

This allows k to hold a negative value (between -2147483648 and -2),
which is then used as an array index in m->xsk_map[k], which results
in an out-of-bounds access.

	spin_lock_bh(&m->lock);
	map_entry = &m->xsk_map[k]; // Out-of-bounds map_entry
	old_xs = unrcu_pointer(xchg(map_entry, NULL));  // Oob write
	if (old_xs)
		xsk_map_sock_delete(old_xs, map_entry);
	spin_unlock_bh(&m->lock);

The xchg operation can then be used to cause an out-of-bounds write.
Moreover, the invalid map_entry passed to xsk_map_sock_delete can lead
to further memory corruption.
""

It indeed results in following splat:

Jordy reported issue against XSKMAP which also applies to DEVMAP - the
index used for accessing map entry, due to being a signed integer,
causes the OOB writes. Fix is simple as changing the type from int to
u32, however, when compared to XSKMAP case, one more thing needs to be
addressed.

When map is released from system via dev_map_free(), we iterate through
all of the entries and an iterator variable is also an int, which
implies OOB accesses. Again, change it to be u32.

Example splat below:

cacheinfo: Allocate memory during CPU hotplug if not done from the primary CPU

Commit

  5944ce092b97 (""arch_topology: Build cacheinfo from primary CPU"")

adds functionality that architectures can use to optionally allocate and
build cacheinfo early during boot. Commit

  6539cffa9495 (""cacheinfo: Add arch specific early level initializer"")

lets secondary CPUs correct (and reallocate memory) cacheinfo data if
needed.

If the early build functionality is not used and cacheinfo does not need
correction, memory for cacheinfo is never allocated. x86 does not use
the early build functionality. Consequently, during the cacheinfo CPU
hotplug callback, last_level_cache_is_valid() attempts to dereference
a NULL pointer:

Allocate memory for cacheinfo during the cacheinfo CPU hotplug callback
if not done earlier.

Moreover, before determining the validity of the last-level cache info,
ensure that it has been allocated. Simply checking for non-zero
cache_leaves() is not sufficient, as some architectures (e.g., Intel
processors) have non-zero cache_leaves() before allocation.

Dereferencing NULL cacheinfo can occur in update_per_cpu_data_slice_size().
This function iterates over all online CPUs. However, a CPU may have come
online recently, but its cacheinfo may not have been allocated yet.

While here, remove an unnecessary indentation in allocate_cache_info().

nilfs2: fix potential out-of-bounds memory access in nilfs_find_entry()

Syzbot reported that when searching for records in a directory where the
inode's i_size is corrupted and has a large value, memory access outside
the folio/page range may occur, or a use-after-free bug may be detected if
KASAN is enabled.

This is because nilfs_last_byte(), which is called by nilfs_find_entry()
and others to calculate the number of valid bytes of directory data in a
page from i_size and the page index, loses the upper 32 bits of the 64-bit
size information due to an inappropriate type of local variable to which
the i_size value is assigned.

This caused a large byte offset value due to underflow in the end address
calculation in the calling nilfs_find_entry(), resulting in memory access
that exceeds the folio/page size.

Fix this issue by changing the type of the local variable causing the bit
loss from ""unsigned int"" to ""u64"".  The return value of nilfs_last_byte()
is also of type ""unsigned int"", but it is truncated so as not to exceed
PAGE_SIZE and no bit loss occurs, so no change is required."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

 BUG: non-zero pgtables_bytes on freeing mm: -16384

On LoongArch system, invalid huge pte entry should be invalid_pte_table
or a single _PAGE_HUGE bit rather than a zero value. And it should be
the same with invalid pmd entry, since pmd_none() is called by function
free_pgd_range() and pmd_none() return 0 by huge_pte_clear(). So single
_PAGE_HUGE bit is also treated as a valid pte table and free_pte_range()
will be called in free_pmd_range().

  free_pmd_range()
        pmd = pmd_offset(pud, addr);
        do {
                next = pmd_addr_end(addr, end);
                if (pmd_none_or_clear_bad(pmd))
                        continue;
                free_pte_range(tlb, pmd, addr);
        } while (pmd++, addr = next, addr != end);

Here invalid_pte_table is used for both invalid huge pte entry and
pmd entry."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

scsi: sg: Fix slab-use-after-free read in sg_release()

Fix a use-after-free bug in sg_release(), detected by syzbot with KASAN:

BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in lock_release+0x151/0xa30
kernel/locking/lockdep.c:5838
__mutex_unlock_slowpath+0xe2/0x750 kernel/locking/mutex.c:912
sg_release+0x1f4/0x2e0 drivers/scsi/sg.c:407

In sg_release(), the function kref_put(&sfp->f_ref, sg_remove_sfp) is
called before releasing the open_rel_lock mutex. The kref_put() call may
decrement the reference count of sfp to zero, triggering its cleanup
through sg_remove_sfp(). This cleanup includes scheduling deferred work
via sg_remove_sfp_usercontext(), which ultimately frees sfp.

After kref_put(), sg_release() continues to unlock open_rel_lock and may
reference sfp or sdp. If sfp has already been freed, this results in a
slab-use-after-free error.

Move the kref_put(&sfp->f_ref, sg_remove_sfp) call after unlocking the
open_rel_lock mutex. This ensures:

 - No references to sfp or sdp occur after the reference count is
   decremented.

 - Cleanup functions such as sg_remove_sfp() and
   sg_remove_sfp_usercontext() can safely execute without impacting the
   mutex handling in sg_release().

The fix has been tested and validated by syzbot. This patch closes the
bug reported at the following syzkaller link and ensures proper
sequencing of resource cleanup and mutex operations, eliminating the
risk of use-after-free errors in sg_release()."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

In __SK_REDIRECT, a more concise way is delaying the uncharging after sent
bytes are finalized, and uncharge this value. When (ret < 0), we shall
invoke sk_msg_free.

Same thing happens in case __SK_DROP, when tosend is set to apply_bytes,
we may miss uncharging (msg->sg.size - apply_bytes) bytes. The same
warning will be reported in selftest.

[...]
468 case __SK_DROP:
469 default:
470 sk_msg_free_partial(sk, msg, tosend);
471 sk_msg_apply_bytes(psock, tosend);

473 return -EACCES;

So instead of sk_msg_free_partial we can do sk_msg_free here."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

net: avoid potential UAF in default_operstate()

syzbot reported an UAF in default_operstate() [1]

Issue is a race between device and netns dismantles.

After calling __rtnl_unlock() from netdev_run_todo(),
we can not assume the netns of each device is still alive.

Make sure the device is not in NETREG_UNREGISTERED state,
and add an ASSERT_RTNL() before the call to
__dev_get_by_index().

We might move this ASSERT_RTNL() in __dev_get_by_index()
in the future.

It is caused by repeated release of LGR/link refcnt. One suspect is that
smc_conn_free() is called repeatedly because some smc_conn_free() from
server listening path are not protected by sock lock.

e.g.

Calls under socklock        | smc_listen_work
-------------------------------------------------------
lock_sock(sk)               | smc_conn_abort
smc_conn_free               | \- smc_conn_free
\- smcr_link_put            |    \- smcr_link_put (duplicated)

tipc: Fix use-after-free of kernel socket in cleanup_bearer().

syzkaller reported a use-after-free of UDP kernel socket
in cleanup_bearer() without repro. [0][1]

When bearer_disable() calls tipc_udp_disable(), cleanup
of the UDP kernel socket is deferred by work calling
cleanup_bearer().

tipc_exit_net() waits for such works to finish by checking
tipc_net(net)->wq_count.  However, the work decrements the
count too early before releasing the kernel socket,
unblocking cleanup_net() and resulting in use-after-free.

Let's move the decrement after releasing the socket in
cleanup_bearer().

CVE-2024-56644	2024-12-27T15:15:24.163	2025-09-26T16:49:02.120	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/ipv6: release expired exception dst cached in socket

Dst objects get leaked in ip6_negative_advice() when this function is
executed for an expired IPv6 route located in the exception table. There
are several conditions that must be fulfilled for the leak to occur:
* an ICMPv6 packet indicating a change of the MTU for the path is received,
  resulting in an exception dst being created
* a TCP connection that uses the exception dst for routing packets must
  start timing out so that TCP begins retransmissions
* after the exception dst expires, the FIB6 garbage collector must not run
  before TCP executes ip6_negative_advice() for the expired exception dst

When TCP executes ip6_negative_advice() for an exception dst that has
expired and if no other socket holds a reference to the exception dst, the
refcount of the exception dst is 2, which corresponds to the increment
made by dst_init() and the increment made by the TCP socket for which the
connection is timing out. The refcount made by the socket is never
released. The refcount of the dst is decremented in sk_dst_reset() but
that decrement is counteracted by a dst_hold() intentionally placed just
before the sk_dst_reset() in ip6_negative_advice(). After
ip6_negative_advice() has finished, there is no other object tied to the
dst. The socket lost its reference stored in sk_dst_cache and the dst is
no longer in the exception table. The exception dst becomes a leaked
object.

As a result of this dst leak, an unbalanced refcount is reported for the
loopback device of a net namespace being destroyed under kernels that do
not contain e5f80fcf869a (""ipv6: give an IPv6 dev to blackhole_netdev""):
unregister_netdevice: waiting for lo to become free. Usage count = 2

Fix the dst leak by removing the dst_hold() in ip6_negative_advice(). The
patch that introduced the dst_hold() in ip6_negative_advice() was
92f1655aa2b22 (""net: fix __dst_negative_advice() race""). But 92f1655aa2b22
merely refactored the code with regards to the dst refcount so the issue
was present even before 92f1655aa2b22. The bug was introduced in
54c1a859efd9f (""ipv6: Don't drop cache route entry unless timer actually
expired."") where the expired cached route is deleted and the sk_dst_cache
member of the socket is set to NULL by calling dst_negative_advice() but
the refcount belonging to the socket is left unbalanced.

The IPv4 version - ipv4_negative_advice() - is not affected by this bug.
When the TCP connection times out ipv4_negative_advice() merely resets the
sk_dst_cache of the socket while decrementing the refcount of the
exception dst."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

net: enetc: Do not configure preemptible TCs if SIs do not support

Both ENETC PF and VF drivers share enetc_setup_tc_mqprio() to configure
MQPRIO. And enetc_setup_tc_mqprio() calls enetc_change_preemptible_tcs()
to configure preemptible TCs. However, only PF is able to configure
preemptible TCs. Because only PF has related registers, while VF does not
have these registers. So for VF, its hw->port pointer is NULL. Therefore,

nf_tables_chain_destroy can sleep, it can't be used from call_rcu

Moreover, nf_tables_rule_release() is only safe for error unwinding,
while transaction mutex is held and the to-be-desroyed rule was not
exposed to either dataplane or dumps, as it deactives+frees without
the required synchronize_rcu() in-between.

nft_rule_expr_deactivate() callbacks will change ->use counters
of other chains/sets, see e.g. nft_lookup .deactivate callback, these
must be serialized via transaction mutex.

Also add a few lockdep asserts to make this more explicit.

Calling synchronize_rcu() isn't ideal, but fixing this without is hard

In case the synchronize_rcu becomes an issue, we can explore alternatives.

One way would be to allocate nft_trans_rule objects + one nft_trans_chain

ALSA: control: Avoid WARN() for symlink errors

Using WARN() for showing the error of symlink creations don't give
more information than telling that something goes wrong, since the
usual code path is a lregister callback from each control element
creation.  More badly, the use of WARN() rather confuses fuzzer as if
it were serious issues.

This patch downgrades the warning messages to use the normal dev_err()
instead of WARN().  For making it clearer, add the function name to
the prefix, too."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

net: defer final 'struct net' free in netns dismantle

Ilya reported a slab-use-after-free in dst_destroy [1]

Issue is in xfrm6_net_init() and xfrm4_net_init() :

They copy xfrm[46]_dst_ops_template into net->xfrm.xfrm[46]_dst_ops.

But net structure might be freed before all the dst callbacks are
called. So when dst_destroy() calls later :

if (dst->ops->destroy)
    dst->ops->destroy(dst);

dst->ops points to the old net->xfrm.xfrm[46]_dst_ops, which has been freed.

See a relevant issue fixed in :

ac888d58869b (""net: do not delay dst_entries_add() in dst_release()"")

A fix is to queue the 'struct net' to be freed after one
another cleanup_net() round (and existing rcu_barrier())

Then close(map) enqueues bpf_map_free_deferred, which finally calls
sock_map_free(). This results in some refcount_t warnings along with
a KASAN splat [1].

Fix __sock_map_delete(), do not allow sock_map_unref() on elements that
may have been replaced.

bpf,perf: Fix invalid prog_array access in perf_event_detach_bpf_prog

Syzbot reported [1] crash that happens for following tracing scenario:

  - create tracepoint perf event with attr.inherit=1, attach it to the
    process and set bpf program to it
  - attached process forks -> chid creates inherited event

    the new child event shares the parent's bpf program and tp_event
    (hence prog_array) which is global for tracepoint

  - exit both process and its child -> release both events
  - first perf_event_detach_bpf_prog call will release tp_event->prog_array
    and second perf_event_detach_bpf_prog will crash, because
    tp_event->prog_array is NULL

The fix makes sure the perf_event_detach_bpf_prog checks prog_array
is valid before it tries to remove the bpf program from it.

usb: gadget: u_serial: Fix the issue that gs_start_io crashed due to accessing null pointer

Considering that in some extreme cases,
when u_serial driver is accessed by multiple threads,
Thread A is executing the open operation and calling the gs_open,
Thread B is executing the disconnect operation and calling the
gserial_disconnect function,The port->port_usb pointer will be set to NULL.

    gs_free_requests(port->port_usb->in)     spin_unlock(&port->port_lock)

This causes thread A to access a null pointer (port->port_usb is null)
when calling the gs_free_requests function, causing a crash.

If port_usb is NULL, the release request will be skipped as it
will be done by gserial_disconnect.

So add a null pointer check to gs_start_io before attempting

create_pgd_mapping()/alloc_pmd_late(). Instead, the vmemmap page table
code allocates a page, and calls vmemmap_set_pmd(). This results in
that the pmd ctor is *not* called, nor would it make sense to do so.

Now, when tearing down a vmemmap page table pmd, the cleanup code
would unconditionally, and incorrectly call the pmd dtor, which
results in a crash (best case).

CVE-2024-56674	2024-12-27T15:15:27.313	2025-10-01T20:17:39.950	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

virtio_net: correct netdev_tx_reset_queue() invocation point

When virtnet_close is followed by virtnet_open, some TX completions can
possibly remain unconsumed, until they are finally processed during the
first NAPI poll after the netdev_tx_reset_queue(), resulting in a crash
[1]. Commit b96ed2c97c79 (""virtio_net: move netdev_tx_reset_queue() call
before RX napi enable"") was not sufficient to eliminate all BQL crash
cases for virtio-net.

This issue can be reproduced with the latest net-next master by running:
`while :; do ip l set DEV down; ip l set DEV up; done` under heavy network
TX load from inside the machine.

netdev_tx_reset_queue() can actually be dropped from virtnet_open path;
the device is not stopped in any case. For BQL core part, it's just like
traffic nearly ceases to exist for some period. For stall detector added
to BQL, even if virtnet_close could somehow lead to some TX completions
delayed for long, followed by virtnet_open, we can just take it as stall
as mentioned in commit 6025b9135f7a (""net: dqs: add NIC stall detector
based on BQL""). Note also that users can still reset stall_max via sysfs.

So, drop netdev_tx_reset_queue() from virtnet_enable_queue_pair(). This
eliminates the BQL crashes. As a result, netdev_tx_reset_queue() is now
explicitly required in freeze/restore path. This patch adds it to
immediately after free_unused_bufs(), following the rule of thumb:
netdev_tx_reset_queue() should follow any SKB freeing not followed by
netdev_tx_completed_queue(). This seems the most consistent and
streamlined approach, and now netdev_tx_reset_queue() runs whenever
free_unused_bufs() is done.

Uprobes always use bpf_prog_run_array_uprobe() under tasks-trace-RCU

uprobe, and non-sleepable BPF programs are freed via normal RCU (see

powerpc/fadump: Move fadump_cma_init to setup_arch() after initmem_init()

During early init CMA_MIN_ALIGNMENT_BYTES can be PAGE_SIZE,
since pageblock_order is still zero and it gets initialized
later during initmem_init() e.g.
setup_arch() -> initmem_init() -> sparse_init() -> set_pageblock_order()

One such use case where this causes issue is -
early_setup() -> early_init_devtree() -> fadump_reserve_mem() -> fadump_cma_init()

This causes CMA memory alignment check to be bypassed in
cma_init_reserved_mem(). Then later cma_activate_area() can hit
a VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(pfn & ((1 << order) - 1)) if the reserved memory
area was not pageblock_order aligned.

Fix it by moving the fadump_cma_init() after initmem_init(),
where other such cma reservations also gets called.

powerpc/mm/fault: Fix kfence page fault reporting

copy_from_kernel_nofault() can be called when doing read of /proc/kcore.
/proc/kcore can have some unmapped kfence objects which when read via
copy_from_kernel_nofault() can cause page faults. Since *_nofault()
functions define their own fixup table for handling fault, use that
instead of asking kfence to handle such faults.

Hence we search the exception tables for the nip which generated the
fault. If there is an entry then we let the fixup table handler handle the
page fault by returning an error from within ___do_page_fault().

This can be easily triggered if someone tries to do dd from /proc/kcore.
eg. dd if=/proc/kcore of=/dev/null bs=1M

ASoC: mediatek: Check num_codecs is not zero to avoid panic during probe

Following commit 13f58267cda3 (""ASoC: soc.h: don't create dummy
Component via COMP_DUMMY()""), COMP_DUMMY() became an array with zero
length, and only gets populated with the dummy struct after the card is
registered. Since the sound card driver's probe happens before the card
registration, accessing any of the members of a dummy component during
probe will result in undefined behavior.

This can be observed in the mt8188 and mt8195 machine sound drivers. By
omitting a dai link subnode in the sound card's node in the Devicetree,
the default uninitialized dummy codec is used, and when its dai_name
pointer gets passed to strcmp() it results in a null pointer dereference
and a kernel panic.

In addition to that, set_card_codec_info() in the generic helpers file,
mtk-soundcard-driver.c, will populate a dai link with a dummy codec when
a dai link node is present in DT but with no codec property.

The result is that at probe time, a dummy codec can either be
uninitialized with num_codecs = 0, or be an initialized dummy codec,
with num_codecs = 1 and dai_name = ""snd-soc-dummy-dai"". In order to
accommodate for both situations, check that num_codecs is not zero
before accessing the codecs' fields but still check for the codec's dai
name against ""snd-soc-dummy-dai"" as needed.

While at it, also drop the check that dai_name is not null in the mt8192
driver, introduced in commit 4d4e1b6319e5 (""ASoC: mediatek: mt8192:
Check existence of dai_name before dereferencing""), as it is actually
redundant given the preceding num_codecs != 0 check."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

usb: musb: Fix hardware lockup on first Rx endpoint request

There is a possibility that a request's callback could be invoked from
usb_ep_queue() (call trace below, supplemented with missing calls):

req->complete from usb_gadget_giveback_request
	(drivers/usb/gadget/udc/core.c:999)
usb_gadget_giveback_request from musb_g_giveback
	(drivers/usb/musb/musb_gadget.c:147)
musb_g_giveback from rxstate
	(drivers/usb/musb/musb_gadget.c:784)
rxstate from musb_ep_restart
	(drivers/usb/musb/musb_gadget.c:1169)
musb_ep_restart from musb_ep_restart_resume_work
	(drivers/usb/musb/musb_gadget.c:1176)
musb_ep_restart_resume_work from musb_queue_resume_work
	(drivers/usb/musb/musb_core.c:2279)
musb_queue_resume_work from musb_gadget_queue
	(drivers/usb/musb/musb_gadget.c:1241)
musb_gadget_queue from usb_ep_queue
	(drivers/usb/gadget/udc/core.c:300)

According to the docstring of usb_ep_queue(), this should not happen:

""Note that @req's ->complete() callback must never be called from within
usb_ep_queue() as that can create deadlock situations.""

In fact, a hardware lockup might occur in the following sequence:

1. The gadget is initialized using musb_gadget_enable().
2. Meanwhile, a packet arrives, and the RXPKTRDY flag is set, raising an
   interrupt.
3. If IRQs are enabled, the interrupt is handled, but musb_g_rx() finds an
   empty queue (next_request() returns NULL). The interrupt flag has
   already been cleared by the glue layer handler, but the RXPKTRDY flag
   remains set.
4. The first request is enqueued using usb_ep_queue(), leading to the call
   of req->complete(), as shown in the call trace above.
5. If the callback enables IRQs and another packet is waiting, step (3)
   repeats. The request queue is empty because usb_g_giveback() removes the
   request before invoking the callback.
6. The endpoint remains locked up, as the interrupt triggered by hardware
   setting the RXPKTRDY flag has been handled, but the flag itself remains
   set.

For this scenario to occur, it is only necessary for IRQs to be enabled at
some point during the complete callback. This happens with the USB Ethernet
gadget, whose rx_complete() callback calls netif_rx(). If called in the
task context, netif_rx() disables the bottom halves (BHs). When the BHs are
re-enabled, IRQs are also enabled to allow soft IRQs to be processed. The
gadget itself is initialized at module load (or at boot if built-in), but
the first request is enqueued when the network interface is brought up,
triggering rx_complete() in the task context via ioctl(). If a packet
arrives while the interface is down, it can prevent the interface from
receiving any further packets from the USB host.

The situation is quite complicated with many parties involved. This
particular issue can be resolved in several possible ways:

1. Ensure that callbacks never enable IRQs. This would be difficult to
   enforce, as discovering how netif_rx() interacts with interrupts was
   already quite challenging and u_ether is not the only function driver.
   Similar ""bugs"" could be hidden in other drivers as well.
2. Disable MUSB interrupts in musb_g_giveback() before calling the callback
   and re-enable them afterwars (by calling musb_{dis,en}able_interrupts(),
   for example). This would ensure that MUSB interrupts are not handled
   during the callback, even if IRQs are enabled. In fact, it would allow
   IRQs to be enabled when releasing the lock. However, this feels like an
   inelegant hack.
3. Modify the interrupt handler to clear the RXPKTRDY flag if the request
   queue is empty. While this approach also feels like a hack, it wastes
   CPU time by attempting to handle incoming packets when the software is
   not ready to process them.
4. Flush the Rx FIFO instead of calling rxstate() in musb_ep_restart().
   This ensures that the hardware can receive packets when there is at
   least one request in the queue. Once I

Consider a scenario where, after passing the validity check within the

CVE-2024-56702	2024-12-28T10:15:17.980	2025-10-01T20:17:41.867	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Mark raw_tp arguments with PTR_MAYBE_NULL

Arguments to a raw tracepoint are tagged as trusted, which carries the
semantics that the pointer will be non-NULL.  However, in certain cases,
a raw tracepoint argument may end up being NULL. More context about this
issue is available in [0].

Thus, there is a discrepancy between the reality, that raw_tp arguments
can actually be NULL, and the verifier's knowledge, that they are never
NULL, causing explicit NULL checks to be deleted, and accesses to such
pointers potentially crashing the kernel.

To fix this, mark raw_tp arguments as PTR_MAYBE_NULL, and then special
case the dereference and pointer arithmetic to permit it, and allow
passing them into helpers/kfuncs; these exceptions are made for raw_tp
programs only. Ensure that we don't do this when ref_obj_id > 0, as in
that case this is an acquired object and doesn't need such adjustment.

The reason we do mask_raw_tp_trusted_reg logic is because other will
recheck in places whether the register is a trusted_reg, and then
consider our register as untrusted when detecting the presence of the
PTR_MAYBE_NULL flag.

To allow safe dereference, we enable PROBE_MEM marking when we see loads
into trusted pointers with PTR_MAYBE_NULL.

While trusted raw_tp arguments can also be passed into helpers or kfuncs
where such broken assumption may cause issues, a future patch set will
tackle their case separately, as PTR_TO_BTF_ID (without PTR_TRUSTED) can
already be passed into helpers and causes similar problems. Thus, they
are left alone for now.

It is possible that these checks also permit passing non-raw_tp args
that are trusted PTR_TO_BTF_ID with null marking. In such a case,
allowing dereference when pointer is NULL expands allowed behavior, so
won't regress existing programs, and the case of passing these into
helpers is the same as above and will be dealt with later.

Also update the failure case in tp_btf_nullable selftest to capture the
new behavior, as the verifier will no longer cause an error when
directly dereference a raw tracepoint argument marked as __nullable.

ipv6: Fix soft lockups in fib6_select_path under high next hop churn

Soft lockups have been observed on a cluster of Linux-based edge routers
located in a highly dynamic environment. Using the `bird` service, these
routers continuously update BGP-advertised routes due to frequently
changing nexthop destinations, while also managing significant IPv6
traffic. The lockups occur during the traversal of the multipath
circular linked-list in the `fib6_select_path` function, particularly
while iterating through the siblings in the list. The issue typically
arises when the nodes of the linked list are unexpectedly deleted
concurrently on a different core—indicated by their 'next' and
'previous' elements pointing back to the node itself and their reference
count dropping to zero. This results in an infinite loop, leading to a
soft lockup that triggers a system panic via the watchdog timer.

Apply RCU primitives in the problematic code sections to resolve the
issue. Where necessary, update the references to fib6_siblings to
annotate or use the RCU APIs.

Include a test script that reproduces the issue. The script
periodically updates the routing table while generating a heavy load
of outgoing IPv6 traffic through multiple iperf3 clients. It
consistently induces infinite soft lockups within a couple of minutes.

can give it different error handling.

Note that the shape of this code changed a lot in commit 5e72b2b41a21

There are some FW error handling paths that can cause us to

we're checking for that.

The case where this popped up was in an AER event where the

The second time through the workqueue was already destroyed,
and destroy_workqueue() choked on the bad wq pointer.

with ""x"", it calls with BIT_ULL(x), but the field is not a port mask,

net: stmmac: fix TSO DMA API usage causing oops

Commit 66600fac7a98 (""net: stmmac: TSO: Fix unbalanced DMA map/unmap
for non-paged SKB data"") moved the assignment of tx_skbuff_dma[]'s
members to be later in stmmac_tso_xmit().

The buf (dma cookie) and len stored in this structure are passed to
dma_unmap_single() by stmmac_tx_clean(). The DMA API requires that
the dma cookie passed to dma_unmap_single() is the same as the value
returned from dma_map_single(). However, by moving the assignment
later, this is not the case when priv->dma_cap.addr64 > 32 as ""des""
is offset by proto_hdr_len.

This causes problems such as:

  dwc-eth-dwmac 2490000.ethernet eth0: Tx DMA map failed

and with DMA_API_DEBUG enabled:

  DMA-API: dwc-eth-dwmac 2490000.ethernet: device driver tries to +free DMA memory it has not allocated [device address=0x000000ffffcf65c0] [size=66 bytes]

netfs/fscache: Add a memory barrier for FSCACHE_VOLUME_CREATING

In fscache_create_volume(), there is a missing memory barrier between the
bit-clearing operation and the wake-up operation. This may cause a
situation where, after a wake-up, the bit-clearing operation hasn't been
detected yet, leading to an indefinite wait. The triggering process is as
follows:

  [cookie1]                [cookie2]                  [volume_work]
fscache_perform_lookup
  fscache_create_volume
                        fscache_perform_lookup
                          fscache_create_volume
			                        fscache_create_volume_work
                                                  cachefiles_acquire_volume

    test_and_set_bit
                            test_and_set_bit
                              goto maybe_wait
      goto no_wait

In the above process, cookie1 and cookie2 has the same volume. When cookie1
enters the -no_wait- process, it will clear the bit and wake up the waiting
process. If a barrier is missing, it may cause cookie2 to remain in the
-wait- process indefinitely.

In commit 3288666c7256 (""fscache: Use clear_and_wake_up_bit() in
fscache_create_volume_work()""), barriers were added to similar operations
in fscache_create_volume_work(), but fscache_create_volume() was missed.

By combining the clear and wake operations into clear_and_wake_up_bit() to

This vulnerability hinges on the attacker's ability to access the session cookie during an active session, either through a man-in-the-middle attack, by exploiting another vulnerability like XSS, or via direct access to the victim's device. Although there is no direct resolution to this vulnerability, it is recommended to always use the latest version of Password Pusher to best mitigate risk. If self-hosting, ensure Password Pusher is hosted exclusively over SSL connections to encrypt traffic and prevent session cookies from being intercepted in transit. Additionally, implement best practices in local security to safeguard user systems, browsers, and data against unauthorized access.	5.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2024-56734	2024-12-30T17:15:10.133	2024-12-30T17:15:10.133	Better Auth is an authentication library for TypeScript. An open redirect vulnerability has been identified in the verify email endpoint of all versions of Better Auth prior to v1.1.6, potentially allowing attackers to redirect users to malicious websites. This issue affects users relying on email verification links generated by the library. The verify email callback endpoint accepts a `callbackURL` parameter. Unlike other verification methods, email verification only uses JWT to verify and redirect without proper validation of the target domain. The origin checker is bypassed in this scenario because it only checks for `POST` requests. An attacker can manipulate this parameter to redirect users to arbitrary URLs controlled by the attacker. Version 1.1.6 contains a patch for the issue.

CVE-2024-56800	2024-12-30T19:15:08.333	2024-12-30T19:15:08.333	Firecrawl is a web scraper that allows users to extract the content of a webpage for a large language model. Versions prior to 1.1.1 contain a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. The scraping engine could be exploited by crafting a malicious site that redirects to a local IP address. This allowed exfiltration of local network resources through the API. The cloud service was patched on December 27th, 2024, and the maintainers have checked that no user data was exposed by this vulnerability. Scraping engines used in the open sourced version of Firecrawl were patched on December 29th, 2024, except for the playwright services which the maintainers have determined to be un-patchable. All users of open-source software (OSS) Firecrawl should upgrade to v1.1.1. As a workaround, OSS Firecrawl users should supply the playwright services with a secure proxy. A proxy can be specified through the `PROXY_SERVER` env in the environment variables. Please refer to the documentation for instructions. Ensure that the proxy server one is using is setup to block all traffic going to link-local IP addresses.	7.4	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L
