CVE-2025-30210	2025-04-01T15:16:05.647	2025-09-23T17:01:46.283	Bruno is an open source IDE for exploring and testing APIs. Prior to 1.39.1, the custom tool-tip components which internally use react-tooltip were setting the content (in this case the Environment name) as raw HTML which then gets injected into DOM on hover. This, combined with loose Content Security Policy restrictions, allowed any valid HTML text containing inline script to get executed on hovering over the respective Environment's name. This vulnerability's attack surface is limited strictly to scenarios where users import collections from untrusted or malicious sources. The exploit requires deliberate action from the user—specifically, downloading and opening an externally provided malicious Bruno or Postman collection export and the user hovers on the environment name.

The MySQL C client library (libmysqlclient) allows authenticated remote actors to read arbitrary files from client systems via a crafted server response to LOAD LOCAL INFILE query, leading to sensitive information disclosure when clients connect to untrusted MySQL servers without explicitly disabling the local infile capability. Mydumper has the local infile option enabled by default and does not have an option to disable it. This can lead to an unexpected arbitrary file read if the Mydumper tool connects to an untrusted server. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.18.2-8.

perf/core: Order the PMU list to fix warning about unordered pmu_ctx_list

Syskaller triggers a warning due to prev_epc->pmu != next_epc->pmu in
perf_event_swap_task_ctx_data(). vmcore shows that two lists have the same
perf_event_pmu_context, but not in the same order.

The problem is that the order of pmu_ctx_list for the parent is impacted by
the time when an event/PMU is added. While the order for a child is
impacted by the event order in the pinned_groups and flexible_groups. So
the order of pmu_ctx_list in the parent and child may be different.

To fix this problem, insert the perf_event_pmu_context to its proper place
after iteration of the pmu_ctx_list.

The follow testcase can trigger above warning:

 # perf record -e cycles --call-graph lbr -- taskset -c 3 ./a.out &
 # perf stat -e cpu-clock,cs -p xxx // xxx is the pid of a.out

 test.c

 void main() {
        int count = 0;
        pid_t pid;

        printf(""%d running\n"", getpid());
        sleep(30);
        printf(""running\n"");

        pid = fork();
        if (pid == -1) {
                printf(""fork error\n"");
                return;
        }
        if (pid == 0) {
                while (1) {
                        count++;

                        count++;
                }
        }
 }

The testcase first opens an LBR event, so it will allocate task_ctx_data,
and then open tracepoint and software events, so the parent context will
have 3 different perf_event_pmu_contexts. On inheritance, child ctx will
insert the perf_event_pmu_context in another order and the warning will
trigger.

fuse: revert back to __readahead_folio() for readahead

In commit 3eab9d7bc2f4 (""fuse: convert readahead to use folios""), the
logic was converted to using the new folio readahead code, which drops
the reference on the folio once it is locked, using an inferred
reference on the folio. Previously we held a reference on the folio for
the entire duration of the readpages call.

This is fine, however for the case for splice pipe responses where we
will remove the old folio and splice in the new folio (see
fuse_try_move_page()), we assume that there is a reference held on the
folio for ap->folios, which is no longer the case.

To fix this, revert back to __readahead_folio() which allows us to hold
the reference on the folio for the duration of readpages until either we
drop the reference ourselves in fuse_readpages_end() or the reference is
dropped after it's replaced in the page cache in the splice case.
This will fix the UAF bug that was reported."

sched_ext: Fix pick_task_scx() picking non-queued tasks when it's called without balance()

a6250aa251ea (""sched_ext: Handle cases where pick_task_scx() is called
without preceding balance_scx()"") added a workaround to handle the cases
where pick_task_scx() is called without prececing balance_scx() which is due
to a fair class bug where pick_taks_fair() may return NULL after a true
return from balance_fair().

The workaround detects when pick_task_scx() is called without preceding
balance_scx() and emulates SCX_RQ_BAL_KEEP and triggers kicking to avoid
stalling. Unfortunately, the workaround code was testing whether @prev was
on SCX to decide whether to keep the task running. This is incorrect as the
task may be on SCX but no longer runnable.

This could lead to a non-runnable task to be returned from pick_task_scx()
which cause interesting confusions and failures. e.g. A common failure mode
is the task ending up with (!on_rq && on_cpu) state which can cause
potential wakers to busy loop, which can easily lead to deadlocks.

Fix it by testing whether @prev has SCX_TASK_QUEUED set. This makes
@prev_on_scx only used in one place. Open code the usage and improve the
comment while at it."

acpi: typec: ucsi: Introduce a ->poll_cci method

For the ACPI backend of UCSI the UCSI ""registers"" are just a memory copy
of the register values in an opregion. The ACPI implementation in the
BIOS ensures that the opregion contents are synced to the embedded
controller and it ensures that the registers (in particular CCI) are
synced back to the opregion on notifications. While there is an ACPI call
that syncs the actual registers to the opregion there is rarely a need to
do this and on some ACPI implementations it actually breaks in various
interesting ways.

The only reason to force a sync from the embedded controller is to poll
CCI while notifications are disabled. Only the ucsi core knows if this

Patch series ""mm: memory_failure: unmap poisoned folio during migrate

Fix two bugs during folio migration if the folio is poisoned.


This patch (of 3):

Commit 6da6b1d4a7df (""mm/hwpoison: convert TTU_IGNORE_HWPOISON to
TTU_HWPOISON"") introduce TTU_HWPOISON to replace TTU_IGNORE_HWPOISON in
order to stop send SIGBUS signal when accessing an error page after a
memory error on a clean folio.  However during page migration, anon folio
must be set with TTU_HWPOISON during unmap_*().  For pagecache we need
some policy just like the one in hwpoison_user_mappings to set this flag. 
So move this policy from hwpoison_user_mappings to unmap_poisoned_folio to
handle this warning properly.

Warning will be produced during unamp poison folio with the following log:

CVE-2025-21910	2025-04-01T16:15:21.550	2025-04-01T20:26:01.990	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: cfg80211: regulatory: improve invalid hints checking

Syzbot keeps reporting an issue [1] that occurs when erroneous symbols
sent from userspace get through into user_alpha2[] via
regulatory_hint_user() call. Such invalid regulatory hints should be
rejected.

While a sanity check from commit 47caf685a685 (""cfg80211: regulatory:
reject invalid hints"") looks to be enough to deter these very cases,
there is a way to get around it due to 2 reasons.

1) The way isalpha() works, symbols other than latin lower and
upper letters may be used to determine a country/domain.
For instance, greek letters will also be considered upper/lower
letters and for such characters isalpha() will return true as well.
However, ISO-3166-1 alpha2 codes should only hold latin
characters.

2) While processing a user regulatory request, between
reg_process_hint_user() and regulatory_hint_user() there happens to
be a call to queue_regulatory_request() which modifies letters in
request->alpha2[] with toupper(). This works fine for latin symbols,
less so for weird letter characters from the second part of _ctype[].

Syzbot triggers a warning in is_user_regdom_saved() by first sending
over an unexpected non-latin letter that gets malformed by toupper()
into a character that ends up failing isalpha() check.

Prevent this by enhancing is_an_alpha2() to ensure that incoming
symbols are latin letters and nothing else.

cdx: Fix possible UAF error in driver_override_show()

Fixed a possible UAF problem in driver_override_show() in drivers/cdx/cdx.c

This function driver_override_show() is part of DEVICE_ATTR_RW, which
includes both driver_override_show() and driver_override_store().
These functions can be executed concurrently in sysfs.

The driver_override_store() function uses driver_set_override() to
update the driver_override value, and driver_set_override() internally
locks the device (device_lock(dev)). If driver_override_show() reads
cdx_dev->driver_override without locking, it could potentially access
a freed pointer if driver_override_store() frees the string
concurrently. This could lead to printing a kernel address, which is a
security risk since DEVICE_ATTR can be read by all users.

Additionally, a similar pattern is used in drivers/amba/bus.c, as well
as many other bus drivers, where device_lock() is taken in the show
function, and it has been working without issues.

This potential bug was detected by our experimental static analysis
tool, which analyzes locking APIs and paired functions to identify

usb: atm: cxacru: fix a flaw in existing endpoint checks

Syzbot once again identified a flaw in usb endpoint checking, see [1].
This time the issue stems from a commit authored by me (2eabb655a968
(""usb: atm: cxacru: fix endpoint checking in cxacru_bind()"")).

While using usb_find_common_endpoints() may usually be enough to
discard devices with wrong endpoints, in this case one needs more
than just finding and identifying the sufficient number of endpoints
of correct types - one needs to check the endpoint's address as well.

Since cxacru_bind() fills URBs with CXACRU_EP_CMD address in mind,
switch the endpoint verification approach to usb_check_XXX_endpoints()
instead to fix incomplete ep testing.

sched/fair: Fix potential memory corruption in child_cfs_rq_on_list

child_cfs_rq_on_list attempts to convert a 'prev' pointer to a cfs_rq.
This 'prev' pointer can originate from struct rq's leaf_cfs_rq_list,
making the conversion invalid and potentially leading to memory
corruption. Depending on the relative positions of leaf_cfs_rq_list and
the task group (tg) pointer within the struct, this can cause a memory
fault or access garbage data.

The issue arises in list_add_leaf_cfs_rq, where both
cfs_rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list and rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list are added to the same
leaf list. Also, rq->tmp_alone_branch can be set to rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list.

This adds a check `if (prev == &rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list)` after the main
conditional in child_cfs_rq_on_list. This ensures that the container_of
operation will convert a correct cfs_rq struct.

This check is sufficient because only cfs_rqs on the same CPU are added
to the list, so verifying the 'prev' pointer against the current rq's list
head is enough.

vlan: enforce underlying device type

Currently, VLAN devices can be created on top of non-ethernet devices.

Besides the fact that it doesn't make much sense, this also causes a
bug which leaks the address of a kernel function to usermode.

When creating a VLAN device, we initialize GARP (garp_init_applicant)
and MRP (mrp_init_applicant) for the underlying device.

As part of the initialization process, we add the multicast address of
each applicant to the underlying device, by calling dev_mc_add.

__dev_mc_add uses dev->addr_len to determine the length of the new
multicast address.

This causes an out-of-bounds read if dev->addr_len is greater than 6,
since the multicast addresses provided by GARP and MRP are only 6
bytes long.

This behaviour can be reproduced using the following commands:

ip tunnel add gretest mode ip6gre local ::1 remote ::2 dev lo
ip l set up dev gretest
ip link add link gretest name vlantest type vlan id 100

Then, the following command will display the address of garp_pdu_rcv:

ip maddr show | grep 01:80:c2:00:00:21

net: ethtool: netlink: Allow NULL nlattrs when getting a phy_device

ethnl_req_get_phydev() is used to lookup a phy_device, in the case an
ethtool netlink command targets a specific phydev within a netdev's
topology.

It takes as a parameter a const struct nlattr *header that's used for

       if (!phydev) {
               NL_SET_ERR_MSG_ATTR(extack, header,

In the notify path after a ->set operation however, there's no request
attributes available.

The typical callsite for the above function looks like:

	phydev = ethnl_req_get_phydev(req_base, tb[ETHTOOL_A_XXX_HEADER],
				      info->extack);

So, when tb is NULL (such as in the ethnl notify path), we have a nice
crash.

It turns out that there's only the PLCA command that is in that case, as
the other phydev-specific commands don't have a notification.

This commit fixes the crash by passing the cmd index and the nlattr
array separately, allowing NULL-checking it directly inside the helper."

ppp: Fix KMSAN uninit-value warning with bpf

Syzbot caught an ""KMSAN: uninit-value"" warning [1], which is caused by the
ppp driver not initializing a 2-byte header when using socket filter.

The following code can generate a PPP filter BPF program:
'''
struct bpf_program fp;
pcap_t *handle;
handle = pcap_open_dead(DLT_PPP_PPPD, 65535);
pcap_compile(handle, &fp, ""ip and outbound"", 0, 0);
bpf_dump(&fp, 1);
'''
Its output is:
'''
(000) ldh [2]
(001) jeq #0x21 jt 2 jf 5
(002) ldb [0]
(003) jeq #0x1 jt 4 jf 5
(004) ret #65535
(005) ret #0
'''
Wen can find similar code at the following link:
https://github.com/ppp-project/ppp/blob/master/pppd/options.c#L1680
The maintainer of this code repository is also the original maintainer
of the ppp driver.

As you can see the BPF program skips 2 bytes of data and then reads the
'Protocol' field to determine if it's an IP packet. Then it read the first
byte of the first 2 bytes to determine the direction.

The issue is that only the first byte indicating direction is initialized
in current ppp driver code while the second byte is not initialized.

For normal BPF programs generated by libpcap, uninitialized data won't be
used, so it's not a problem. However, for carefully crafted BPF programs,
such as those generated by syzkaller [2], which start reading from offset
0, the uninitialized data will be used and caught by KMSAN.

CVE-2025-21932	2025-04-01T16:15:24.040	2025-04-01T20:26:01.990	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: abort vma_modify() on merge out of memory failure

The remainder of vma_modify() relies upon the vmg state remaining pristine
after a merge attempt.

Usually this is the case, however in the one edge case scenario of a merge
attempt failing not due to the specified range being unmergeable, but
rather due to an out of memory error arising when attempting to commit the
merge, this assumption becomes untrue.

This results in vmg->start, end being modified, and thus the proceeding
attempts to split the VMA will be done with invalid start/end values.

Thankfully, it is likely practically impossible for us to hit this in
reality, as it would require a maple tree node pre-allocation failure that
would likely never happen due to it being 'too small to fail', i.e.  the
kernel would simply keep retrying reclaim until it succeeded.

However, this scenario remains theoretically possible, and what we are
doing here is wrong so we must correct it.

The safest option is, when this scenario occurs, to simply give up the
operation.  If we cannot allocate memory to merge, then we cannot allocate
memory to split either (perhaps moreso!).

Any scenario where this would be happening would be under very extreme
(likely fatal) memory pressure, so it's best we give up early.

So there is no doubt it is appropriate to simply bail out in this
scenario.

However, in general we must if at all possible never assume VMG state is
stable after a merge attempt, since merge operations update VMG fields. 
As a result, additionally also make this clear by storing start, end in
local variables.

The issue was reported originally by syzkaller, and by Brad Spengler (via
an off-list discussion), and in both instances it manifested as a
triggering of the assert:

	VM_WARN_ON_VMG(start >= end, vmg);

In vma_merge_existing_range().

It seems at least one scenario in which this is occurring is one in which
the merge being attempted is due to an madvise() across multiple VMAs
which looks like this:

        start     end
          |<------>|
     |----------|------|
     |   vma    | next |
     |----------|------|

When madvise_walk_vmas() is invoked, we first find vma in the above
(determining prev to be equal to vma as we are offset into vma), and then
enter the loop.

We determine the end of vma that forms part of the range we are
madvise()'ing by setting 'tmp' to this value:

		/* Here vma->vm_start <= start < (end|vma->vm_end) */
		tmp = vma->vm_end;

We then invoke the madvise() operation via visit(), letting prev get
updated to point to vma as part of the operation:

		/* Here vma->vm_start <= start < tmp <= (end|vma->vm_end). */
		error = visit(vma, &prev, start, tmp, arg);

Where the visit() function pointer in this instance is
madvise_vma_behavior().

As observed in syzkaller reports, it is ultimately madvise_update_vma()
that is invoked, calling vma_modify_flags_name() and vma_modify() in turn.

Then, in vma_modify(), we attempt the merge:

	merged = vma_merge_existing_range(vmg);
	if (merged)
		return merged;

We invoke this with vmg->start, end set to start, tmp as such:

        start  tmp
          |<--->|
     |----------|------|
     |   vma    | next |
     |----------|------|

We find ourselves in the merge right scenario, but the one in which we
cannot remove the middle (we are offset into vma).

Here we have a special case where vmg->start, end get set to perhaps
unintuitive values - we intended to shrink the middle VMA and expand the
next.

This means vmg->start, end are set to...  vma->vm_start, start.

Now the commit_merge() fails, and vmg->start, end are left like this. 
This means we return to the rest of vma_modify() with vmg->start, end
(here denoted as start', end') set as:

  start' end'
     |<-->|
     |----------|------|
     |   vma    | next |
     |----------|------|

So we now erroneously try to split accordingly.  This is where the
unfortunate

This problem seems particularly prevalent if the user advertises an
endpoint that has a different external vs internal address.  In the case
where the external address is advertised and multiple connections
already exist, multiple subflow SYNs arrive in parallel which tends to
trigger the race during creation of the first local_addr_list entries
which have the internal address instead.

Fix by skipping the replacement of an existing implicit local address if

drm/xe/hmm: Don't dereference struct page pointers without notifier lock

The pnfs that we obtain from hmm_range_fault() point to pages that
we don't have a reference on, and the guarantee that they are still
in the cpu page-tables is that the notifier lock must be held and the
notifier seqno is still valid.

So while building the sg table and marking the pages accesses / dirty
we need to hold this lock with a validated seqno.

However, the lock is reclaim tainted which makes
sg_alloc_table_from_pages_segment() unusable, since it internally
allocates memory.

Instead build the sg-table manually. For the non-iommu case
this might lead to fewer coalesces, but if that's a problem it can
be fixed up later in the resource cursor code. For the iommu case,
the whole sg-table may still be coalesced to a single contigous
device va region.

This avoids marking pages that we don't own dirty and accessed, and
it also avoid dereferencing struct pages that we don't own.

v2:
- Use assert to check whether hmm pfns are valid (Matthew Auld)
- Take into account that large pages may cross range boundaries

v3:
- Don't unnecessarily check for a non-freed sg-table. (Matthew Auld)
- Add a missing up_read() in an error path. (Matthew Auld)

This happens because we have another success path for the zoned mode. When
there is no active zone available, btrfs_reserve_extent() returns
-EAGAIN. In this case, we have two reactions.

(1) If the given range is never allocated, we can only wait for someone
    to finish a zone, so wait on BTRFS_FS_NEED_ZONE_FINISH bit and retry
    afterward.

(2) Or, if some allocations are already done, we must bail out and let
    the caller to send IOs for the allocation. This is because these IOs
    may be necessary to finish a zone.

The commit 06f364284794 (""btrfs: do proper folio cleanup when
cow_file_range() failed"") moved the unlock code from the inside of the
loop to the outside. So, previously, the allocated extents are unlocked
just after the allocation and so before returning from the function.
However, they are no longer unlocked on the case (2) above. That caused
the hang issue.

Fix the issue by modifying the 'end' to the end of the allocated
range. Then, we can exit the loop and the same unlock code can properly
handle the case."

This happens due to the malformed report items sent by the emulated device
which results in a report, that has no fields, being added to the report list.
Due to this appleir_input_configured() is never called, hidinput_connect()
fails which results in the HID_CLAIMED_INPUT flag is not being set. However,
it  does not make appleir_probe() fail and lets the event callback to be
called without the associated input device.

Thus, add a check for the HID_CLAIMED_INPUT flag and leave the event hook
early if the driver didn't claim any input_dev for some reason. Moreover,
some other hid drivers accessing input_dev in their event callbacks do have
similar checks, too.

CVE-2025-21951	2025-04-01T16:15:26.297	2025-10-01T18:15:39.530	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bus: mhi: host: pci_generic: Use pci_try_reset_function() to avoid deadlock

There are multiple places from where the recovery work gets scheduled
asynchronously. Also, there are multiple places where the caller waits
synchronously for the recovery to be completed. One such place is during
the PM shutdown() callback.

If the device is not alive during recovery_work, it will try to reset the
device using pci_reset_function(). This function internally will take the
device_lock() first before resetting the device. By this time, if the lock
has already been acquired, then recovery_work will get stalled while
waiting for the lock. And if the lock was already acquired by the caller
which waits for the recovery_work to be completed, it will lead to
deadlock.

This is what happened on the X1E80100 CRD device when the device died
before shutdown() callback. Driver core calls the driver's shutdown()
callback while holding the device_lock() leading to deadlock.

And this deadlock scenario can occur on other paths as well, like during
the PM suspend() callback, where the driver core would hold the
device_lock() before calling driver's suspend() callback. And if the
recovery_work was already started, it could lead to deadlock. This is also
observed on the X1E80100 CRD.

So to fix both issues, use pci_try_reset_function() in recovery_work. This
function first checks for the availability of the device_lock() before
trying to reset the device. If the lock is available, it will acquire it
and reset the device. Otherwise, it will return -EAGAIN. If that happens,
recovery_work will fail with the error message ""Recovery failed"" as not
much could be done."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

netmem: prevent TX of unreadable skbs

Currently on stable trees we have support for netmem/devmem RX but not
TX. It is not safe to forward/redirect an RX unreadable netmem packet
into the device's TX path, as the device may call dma-mapping APIs on
dma addrs that should not be passed to it.

Fix this by preventing the xmit of unreadable skbs.

Tested by configuring tc redirect:

sudo tc qdisc add dev eth1 ingress
sudo tc filter add dev eth1 ingress protocol ip prio 1 flower ip_proto \
	tcp src_ip 192.168.1.12 action mirred egress redirect dev eth1

Before, I see unreadable skbs in the driver's TX path passed to dma
mapping APIs.

After, I don't see unreadable skbs in the driver's TX path passed to dma
mapping APIs."

[WHY & HOW]
A warning message ""WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 459 at ... /dc_resource.c:3397

display_color_depth == COLOR_DEPTH_141414 is not handled. This is
observed in Radeon RX 6600 XT.

It is fixed by assigning pix_clk * (14 * 3) / 24 - same as the rests.

Also fixes the indentation in get_norm_pix_clk.

Revert ""openvswitch: switch to per-action label counting in conntrack""

Currently, ovs_ct_set_labels() is only called for confirmed conntrack
entries (ct) within ovs_ct_commit(). However, if the conntrack entry
does not have the labels_ext extension, attempting to allocate it in
ovs_ct_get_conn_labels() for a confirmed entry triggers a warning in
nf_ct_ext_add():

This happens when the conntrack entry is created externally before OVS
increments net->ct.labels_used. The issue has become more likely since
commit fcb1aa5163b1 (""openvswitch: switch to per-action label counting
in conntrack""), which changed to use per-action label counting and
increment net->ct.labels_used when a flow with ct action is added.

netfilter: nf_conncount: Fully initialize struct nf_conncount_tuple in insert_tree()

Since commit b36e4523d4d5 (""netfilter: nf_conncount: fix garbage
collection confirm race""), `cpu` and `jiffies32` were introduced to
the struct nf_conncount_tuple.

The commit made nf_conncount_add() initialize `conn->cpu` and
`conn->jiffies32` when allocating the struct.
In contrast, count_tree() was not changed to initialize them.

By commit 34848d5c896e (""netfilter: nf_conncount: Split insert and
traversal""), count_tree() was split and the relevant allocation
code now resides in insert_tree().
Initialize `conn->cpu` and `conn->jiffies32` in insert_tree().

eth: bnxt: do not update checksum in bnxt_xdp_build_skb()

The bnxt_rx_pkt() updates ip_summed value at the end if checksum offload
is enabled.
When the XDP-MB program is attached and it returns XDP_PASS, the
bnxt_xdp_build_skb() is called to update skb_shared_info.
The main purpose of bnxt_xdp_build_skb() is to update skb_shared_info,
but it updates ip_summed value too if checksum offload is enabled.
This is actually duplicate work.

When the bnxt_rx_pkt() updates ip_summed value, it checks if ip_summed
is CHECKSUM_NONE or not.
It means that ip_summed should be CHECKSUM_NONE at this moment.
But ip_summed may already be updated to CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY in the
XDP-MB-PASS path.
So the by skb_checksum_none_assert() WARNS about it.

This is duplicate work and updating ip_summed in the
bnxt_xdp_build_skb() is not needed.

Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix slab-use-after-free Read in l2cap_send_cmd

After the hci sync command releases l2cap_conn, the hci receive data work
queue references the released l2cap_conn when sending to the upper layer.
Add hci dev lock to the hci receive data work queue to synchronize the two.

CVE-2025-21970	2025-04-01T16:15:28.323	2025-04-10T13:15:48.327	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: Bridge, fix the crash caused by LAG state check

When removing LAG device from bridge, NETDEV_CHANGEUPPER event is
triggered. Driver finds the lower devices (PFs) to flush all the
offloaded entries. And mlx5_lag_is_shared_fdb is checked, it returns
false if one of PF is unloaded. In such case,
mlx5_esw_bridge_lag_rep_get() and its caller return NULL, instead of
the alive PF, and the flush is skipped.

Besides, the bridge fdb entry's lastuse is updated in mlx5 bridge
event handler. But this SWITCHDEV_FDB_ADD_TO_BRIDGE event can be
ignored in this case because the upper interface for bond is deleted,
and the entry will never be aged because lastuse is never updated.

To make things worse, as the entry is alive, mlx5 bridge workqueue
keeps sending that event, which is then handled by kernel bridge
notifier. It causes the following crash when accessing the passed bond
netdev which is already destroyed.

To fix this issue, remove such checks. LAG state is already checked in
commit 15f8f168952f (""net/mlx5: Bridge, verify LAG state when adding
bond to bridge""), driver still need to skip offload if LAG becomes
invalid state after initialization.

net_sched: Prevent creation of classes with TC_H_ROOT

The function qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() uses TC_H_ROOT as a termination
condition when traversing up the qdisc tree to update parent backlog
counters. However, if a class is created with classid TC_H_ROOT, the
traversal terminates prematurely at this class instead of reaching the
actual root qdisc, causing parent statistics to be incorrectly maintained.
In case of DRR, this could lead to a crash as reported by Mingi Cho.

Prevent the creation of any Qdisc class with classid TC_H_ROOT

eth: bnxt: fix kernel panic in the bnxt_get_queue_stats{rx | tx}

When qstats-get operation is executed, callbacks of netdev_stats_ops
are called. The bnxt_get_queue_stats{rx | tx} collect per-queue stats
from sw_stats in the rings.
But {rx | tx | cp}_ring are allocated when the interface is up.
So, these rings are not allocated when the interface is down.

The qstats-get is allowed even if the interface is down. However,
the bnxt_get_queue_stats{rx | tx}() accesses cp_ring and tx_ring
without null check.
So, it needs to avoid accessing rings if the interface is down.

Reproducer:
 ip link set $interface down
 ./cli.py --spec netdev.yaml --dump qstats-get
OR
 ip link set $interface down
 python ./stats.py

CVE-2025-21977	2025-04-01T16:15:29.077	2025-04-01T20:26:01.990	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev: hyperv_fb: Fix hang in kdump kernel when on Hyper-V Gen 2 VMs

Gen 2 Hyper-V VMs boot via EFI and have a standard EFI framebuffer
device. When the kdump kernel runs in such a VM, loading the efifb
driver may hang because of accessing the framebuffer at the wrong
memory address.

The scenario occurs when the hyperv_fb driver in the original kernel
moves the framebuffer to a different MMIO address because of conflicts
with an already-running efifb or simplefb driver. The hyperv_fb driver
then informs Hyper-V of the change, which is allowed by the Hyper-V FB
VMBus device protocol. However, when the kexec command loads the kdump
kernel into crash memory via the kexec_file_load() system call, the
system call doesn't know the framebuffer has moved, and it sets up the
kdump screen_info using the original framebuffer address. The transition
to the kdump kernel does not go through the Hyper-V host, so Hyper-V
does not reset the framebuffer address like it would do on a reboot.
When efifb tries to run, it accesses a non-existent framebuffer
address, which traps to the Hyper-V host. After many such accesses,
the Hyper-V host thinks the guest is being malicious, and throttles
the guest to the point that it runs very slowly or appears to have hung.

When the kdump kernel is loaded into crash memory via the kexec_load()
system call, the problem does not occur. In this case, the kexec command
builds the screen_info table itself in user space from data returned
by the FBIOGET_FSCREENINFO ioctl against /dev/fb0, which gives it the
new framebuffer location.

This problem was originally reported in 2020 [1], resulting in commit
3cb73bc3fa2a (""hyperv_fb: Update screen_info after removing old
framebuffer""). This commit solved the problem by setting orig_video_isVGA
to 0, so the kdump kernel was unaware of the EFI framebuffer. The efifb
driver did not try to load, and no hang occurred. But in 2024, commit
c25a19afb81c (""fbdev/hyperv_fb: Do not clear global screen_info"")
effectively reverted 3cb73bc3fa2a. Commit c25a19afb81c has no reference
to 3cb73bc3fa2a, so perhaps it was done without knowing the implications
that were reported with 3cb73bc3fa2a. In any case, as of commit
c25a19afb81c, the original problem came back again.

Interestingly, the hyperv_drm driver does not have this problem because
it never moves the framebuffer. The difference is that the hyperv_drm
driver removes any conflicting framebuffers *before* allocating an MMIO
address, while the hyperv_fb drivers removes conflicting framebuffers
*after* allocating an MMIO address. With the ""after"" ordering, hyperv_fb
may encounter a conflict and move the framebuffer to a different MMIO
address. But the conflict is essentially bogus because it is removed
a few lines of code later.

Rather than fix the problem with the approach from 2020 in commit
3cb73bc3fa2a, instead slightly reorder the steps in hyperv_fb so
conflicting framebuffers are removed before allocating an MMIO address.
Then the default framebuffer MMIO address should always be available, and
there's never any confusion about which framebuffer address the kdump
kernel should use -- it's always the original address provided by
the Hyper-V host. This approach is already used by the hyperv_drm
driver, and is consistent with the usage guidelines at the head of
the module with the function aperture_remove_conflicting_devices().

This approach also solves a related minor problem when kexec_load()
is used to load the kdump kernel. With current code, unbinding and
rebinding the hyperv_fb driver could result in the framebuffer moving
back to the default framebuffer address, because on the rebind there
are no conflicts. If such a move is done after the kdump kernel is
loaded with the new framebuffer address, at kdump time it could again
have the wrong address.

This problem and fix are described in terms of the kdump kernel, but
it can also occur

CVE-2025-21984	2025-04-01T16:15:29.810	2025-10-01T18:15:41.730	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: fix kernel BUG when userfaultfd_move encounters swapcache

userfaultfd_move() checks whether the PTE entry is present or a
swap entry.

- If the PTE entry is present, move_present_pte() handles folio
  migration by setting:

  src_folio->index = linear_page_index(dst_vma, dst_addr);

- If the PTE entry is a swap entry, move_swap_pte() simply copies
  the PTE to the new dst_addr.

This approach is incorrect because, even if the PTE is a swap entry,
it can still reference a folio that remains in the swap cache.

This creates a race window between steps 2 and 4.
 1. add_to_swap: The folio is added to the swapcache.
 2. try_to_unmap: PTEs are converted to swap entries.
 3. pageout: The folio is written back.
 4. Swapcache is cleared.
If userfaultfd_move() occurs in the window between steps 2 and 4,
after the swap PTE has been moved to the destination, accessing the
destination triggers do_swap_page(), which may locate the folio in
the swapcache. However, since the folio's index has not been updated
to match the destination VMA, do_swap_page() will detect a mismatch.

This can result in two critical issues depending on the system
configuration.

If KSM is disabled, both small and large folios can trigger a BUG
during the add_rmap operation due to:

 page_pgoff(folio, page) != linear_page_index(vma, address)

net: switchdev: Convert blocking notification chain to a raw one

A blocking notification chain uses a read-write semaphore to protect the
integrity of the chain. The semaphore is acquired for writing when
adding / removing notifiers to / from the chain and acquired for reading
when traversing the chain and informing notifiers about an event.

In case of the blocking switchdev notification chain, recursive
notifications are possible which leads to the semaphore being acquired
twice for reading and to lockdep warnings being generated [1].

Specifically, this can happen when the bridge driver processes a
SWITCHDEV_BRPORT_UNOFFLOADED event which causes it to emit notifications
about deferred events when calling switchdev_deferred_process().

Fix this by converting the notification chain to a raw notification
chain in a similar fashion to the netdev notification chain. Protect
the chain using the RTNL mutex by acquiring it when modifying the chain.
Events are always informed under the RTNL mutex, but add an assertion in
call_switchdev_blocking_notifiers() to make sure this is not violated in
the future.

Maintain the ""blocking"" prefix as events are always emitted from process
context and listeners are allowed to block.

x86/microcode/AMD: Fix out-of-bounds on systems with CPU-less NUMA nodes

Currently, load_microcode_amd() iterates over all NUMA nodes, retrieves their
CPU masks and unconditionally accesses per-CPU data for the first CPU of each
mask.

According to Documentation/admin-guide/mm/numaperf.rst:

  ""Some memory may share the same node as a CPU, and others are provided as
  memory only nodes.""

Therefore, some node CPU masks may be empty and wouldn't have a ""first CPU"".

On a machine with far memory (and therefore CPU-less NUMA nodes):
- cpumask_of_node(nid) is 0
- cpumask_first(0) is CONFIG_NR_CPUS
- cpu_data(CONFIG_NR_CPUS) accesses the cpu_info per-CPU array at an
  index that is 1 out of bounds

This does not have any security implications since flashing microcode is
a privileged operation but I believe this has reliability implications by
potentially corrupting memory while flashing a microcode update.

When booting with CONFIG_UBSAN_BOUNDS=y on an AMD machine that flashes
a microcode update. I get the following splat:

  UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in arch/x86/kernel/cpu/microcode/amd.c:X:Y
  index 512 is out of range for type 'unsigned long[512]'

   ksys_write
   do_syscall_64
   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe

Change the loop to go over only NUMA nodes which have CPUs before determining
whether the first CPU on the respective node needs microcode update.

A Self Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified within the Arduino-IDE prior to version v2.3.5. The vulnerability occurs in the Additional Board Manager URLs field, which can be found in the Preferences -> Settings section of the Arduino IDE interface. In the vulnerable versions, any values entered in this field are directly displayed to the user through a notification tooltip object, without a proper output encoding routine, due to the underlying ElectronJS engine interpretation.

Prior to 2.2.1, the Tauri shell plugin exposes functionality to execute code and open programs on the system. The open endpoint of this plugin is designed to allow open functionality with the system opener (e.g. xdg-open on Linux). This was meant to be restricted to a reasonable number of protocols like https or mailto by default. This default restriction was not functional due to improper validation of the allowed protocols, allowing for potentially dangerous protocols like file://, smb://, or nfs:// and others to be opened by the system registered protocol handler. By passing untrusted user input to the open endpoint these potentially dangerous protocols can be abused to gain remote code execution on the system. This either requires direct exposure of the endpoint to application users or code execution in the frontend of a Tauri application.

Prior to 1.0.1, if the get-workflow-version-action step fails, the exception output may include the GITHUB_TOKEN. If the full token is included in the exception output, GitHub will automatically redact the secret from the GitHub Actions logs. However, the token may be truncated—causing part of the GITHUB_TOKEN to be displayed in plaintext in the GitHub Actions logs. Anyone with read access to the GitHub repository can view GitHub Actions logs. For public repositories, anyone can view the GitHub Actions logs. The opportunity to exploit this vulnerability is limited—the GITHUB_TOKEN is automatically revoked when the job completes. However, there is an opportunity for an attack in the time between the GITHUB_TOKEN being displayed in the logs and the completion of the job. Users using the github-token input are impacted.

is a bug unless use_pde/unuse_pde() pair has been used.

use_pde/unuse_pde can be avoided (2 atomic ops!) because pde->proc_ops

CVE-2025-22003	2025-04-03T08:15:15.840	2025-10-01T17:15:41.077	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: ucan: fix out of bound read in strscpy() source

Commit 7fdaf8966aae (""can: ucan: use strscpy() to instead of strncpy()"")
unintentionally introduced a one byte out of bound read on strscpy()'s
source argument (which is kind of ironic knowing that strscpy() is meant
to be a more secure alternative :)).

Let's consider below buffers:

  dest[len + 1]; /* will be NUL terminated */
  src[len]; /* may not be NUL terminated */

When doing:

  strncpy(dest, src, len);
  dest[len] = '\0';

strncpy() will read up to len bytes from src.

On the other hand:

  strscpy(dest, src, len + 1);

will read up to len + 1 bytes from src, that is to say, an out of bound
read of one byte will occur on src if it is not NUL terminated. Note
that the src[len] byte is never copied, but strscpy() still needs to
read it to check whether a truncation occurred or not.

This exact pattern happened in ucan.

The root cause is that the source is not NUL terminated. Instead of
doing a copy in a local buffer, directly NUL terminate it as soon as
usb_control_msg() returns. With this, the local firmware_str[] variable
can be removed.

On top of this do a couple refactors:

  - ucan_ctl_payload->raw is only used for the firmware string, so
    rename it to ucan_ctl_payload->fw_str and change its type from u8 to
    char.

  - ucan_device_request_in() is only used to retrieve the firmware
    string, so rename it to ucan_get_fw_str() and refactor it to make it
    directly handle all the string termination logic."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

A race condition exists in the AWS4-HMAC (compatible with S3) authorization method of the HTTP component of the FTP server. The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account."	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2025-31492	2025-04-06T20:15:15.063	2025-04-17T11:15:48.567	mod_auth_openidc is an OpenID Certified authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that implements the OpenID Connect Relying Party functionality. Prior to 2.4.16.11, a bug in a mod_auth_openidc results in disclosure of protected content to unauthenticated users. The conditions for disclosure are an OIDCProviderAuthRequestMethod POST, a valid account, and there mustn't be any application-level gateway (or load balancer etc) protecting the server. When you request a protected resource, the response includes the HTTP status, the HTTP headers, the intended response (the self-submitting form), and the protected resource (with no headers). This is an example of a request for a protected resource, including all the data returned. In the case where mod_auth_openidc returns a form, it has to return OK from check_userid so as not to go down the error path in httpd. This means httpd will try to issue the protected resource. oidc_content_handler is called early, which has the opportunity to prevent the normal output being issued by httpd. oidc_content_handler has a number of checks for when it intervenes, but it doesn't check for this case, so the handler returns DECLINED. Consequently, httpd appends the protected content to the response. The issue has been patched in mod_auth_openidc versions >= 2.4.16.11.

CVE-2025-31496	2025-04-07T21:15:42.720	2025-04-08T18:13:53.347	apollo-compiler is a query-based compiler for the GraphQL query language. Prior to 1.27.0, a vulnerability in Apollo Compiler allowed queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments to be prohibitively expensive to validate. Named fragments were being processed once per fragment spread in some cases during query validation, leading to exponential resource usage when deeply nested and reused fragments were involved. This could lead to excessive resource consumption and denial of service in applications. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.27.0.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2025-32029	2025-04-07T21:15:42.880	2025-04-08T18:13:53.347	ts-asn1-der is a collection of utility classes to encode ASN.1 data following DER rule. Incorrect number DER encoding can lead to denial on service for absolute values in the range 2**31 -- 2**32 - 1. The arithmetic in the numBitLen didn't take into account that values in this range could result in a negative result upon applying the >> operator, leading to an infinite loop. The issue is patched in version 1.0.4. If upgrading is not an option, the issue can be mitigated by validating inputs to Asn1Integer to ensure that they are not smaller than -2**31 + 1 and no larger than 2**31 - 1.					
CVE-2025-32030	2025-04-07T21:15:43.037	2025-08-01T16:52:41.117	Apollo Gateway provides utilities for combining multiple GraphQL microservices into a single GraphQL endpoint. Prior to 2.10.1, a vulnerability in Apollo Gateway allowed queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments to be prohibitively expensive to query plan, specifically during named fragment expansion.

This could lead to excessive resource consumption and denial of service. This has been remediated in @apollo/gateway version 2.10.1.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2025-32031	2025-04-07T21:15:43.220	2025-08-01T16:50:52.737	Apollo Gateway provides utilities for combining multiple GraphQL microservices into a single GraphQL endpoint. Prior to 2.10.1, a vulnerability in Apollo Gateway allowed queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments to be prohibitively expensive to query plan, specifically due to internal optimizations being frequently bypassed. The query planner includes an optimization that significantly speeds up planning for applicable GraphQL selections. However, queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments can generate many selections where this optimization does not apply, leading to significantly longer planning times. Because the query planner does not enforce a timeout, a small number of such queries can render gateway inoperable. This could lead to excessive resource consumption and denial of service. This has been remediated in @apollo/gateway version 2.10.1.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

A vulnerability in Apollo Router allowed queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments to be prohibitively expensive to query plan, specifically due to internal optimizations being frequently bypassed. The query planner includes an optimization that significantly speeds up planning for applicable GraphQL selections. However, queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments can generate many selections where this optimization does not apply, leading to significantly longer planning times. Because the query planner does not enforce a timeout, a small number of such queries can exhaust router's thread pool, rendering it inoperable. This could lead to excessive resource consumption and denial of service. This has been remediated in apollo-router versions 1.61.2 and 2.1.1.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2025-32033	2025-04-07T21:15:43.527	2025-04-08T18:13:53.347	The Apollo Router Core is a configurable, high-performance graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation 2. Prior to 1.61.2 and 2.1.1, the operation limits plugin uses unsigned 32-bit integers to track limit counters (e.g. for a query's height). If a counter exceeded the maximum value for this data type (4,294,967,295), it wrapped around to 0, unintentionally allowing queries to bypass configured thresholds. This could occur for large queries if the payload limit were sufficiently increased, but could also occur for small queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments. This has been remediated in apollo-router versions 1.61.2 and 2.1.1.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

KVM: arm64: Unconditionally save+flush host FPSIMD/SVE/SME state

There are several problems with the way hyp code lazily saves the host's
FPSIMD/SVE state, including:

* Host SVE being discarded unexpectedly due to inconsistent
  configuration of TIF_SVE and CPACR_ELx.ZEN. This has been seen to
  result in QEMU crashes where SVE is used by memmove(), as reported by
  Eric Auger:

  https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-68997

* Host SVE state is discarded *after* modification by ptrace, which was an
  unintentional ptrace ABI change introduced with lazy discarding of SVE state.

* The host FPMR value can be discarded when running a non-protected VM,
  where FPMR support is not exposed to a VM, and that VM uses
  FPSIMD/SVE. In these cases the hyp code does not save the host's FPMR
  before unbinding the host's FPSIMD/SVE/SME state, leaving a stale
  value in memory.

Avoid these by eagerly saving and ""flushing"" the host's FPSIMD/SVE/SME
state when loading a vCPU such that KVM does not need to save any of the
host's FPSIMD/SVE/SME state. For clarity, fpsimd_kvm_prepare() is
removed and the necessary call to fpsimd_save_and_flush_cpu_state() is
placed in kvm_arch_vcpu_load_fp(). As 'fpsimd_state' and 'fpmr_ptr'
should not be used, they are set to NULL; all uses of these will be
removed in subsequent patches.

Historical problems go back at least as far as v5.17, e.g. erroneous
assumptions about TIF_SVE being clear in commit:

  8383741ab2e773a9 (""KVM: arm64: Get rid of host SVE tracking/saving"")

... and so this eager save+flush probably needs to be backported to ALL
stable trees."

mm/migrate: fix shmem xarray update during migration

A shmem folio can be either in page cache or in swap cache, but not at the
same time.  Namely, once it is in swap cache, folio->mapping should be
NULL, and the folio is no longer in a shmem mapping.

In __folio_migrate_mapping(), to determine the number of xarray entries to
update, folio_test_swapbacked() is used, but that conflates shmem in page
cache case and shmem in swap cache case.  It leads to xarray multi-index
entry corruption, since it turns a sibling entry to a normal entry during
xas_store() (see [1] for a userspace reproduction).  Fix it by only using
folio_test_swapcache() to determine whether xarray is storing swap cache
entries or not to choose the right number of xarray entries to update.

Note:
In __split_huge_page(), folio_test_anon() && folio_test_swapcache() is

swap cache case.  It could lead to NULL pointer dereferencing when a

!folio_test_anon() is true and folio->mapping is NULL.  But fortunately,
its caller split_huge_page_to_list_to_order() bails out early with EBUSY

From 1.32.3 through 1.34.4, there is a use-after-free in read_answers() when process_answer() may re-enqueue a query either due to a DNS Cookie Failure or when the upstream server does not properly support EDNS, or possibly on TCP queries if the remote closed the connection immediately after a response. If there was an issue trying to put that new transaction on the wire, it would close the connection handle, but read_answers() was still expecting the connection handle to be available to possibly dequeue other responses. In theory a remote attacker might be able to trigger this by flooding the target with ICMP UNREACHABLE packets if they also control the upstream nameserver and can return a result with one of those conditions, this has been untested. Otherwise only a local attacker might be able to change system behavior to make send()/write() return a failure condition. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.34.5.

CVE-2025-32018	2025-04-08T16:15:27.487	2025-04-08T18:13:53.347	Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions 0.45.0 through 0.48.6, the Cursor app introduced a regression affecting the set of file paths the Cursor Agent is permitted to modify automatically. Under specific conditions, the agent could be prompted, either directly by the user or via maliciously crafted context, to automatically write to files outside of the opened workspace. This behavior required deliberate prompting, making successful exploitation highly impractical in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, the edited file was still displayed in the UI as usual for user review, making it unlikely for the edit to go unnoticed by the user.

A vulnerability in Apollo Router's usage of Apollo Compiler allowed queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments to be prohibitively expensive to validate. This could lead to excessive resource consumption and denial of service.  Apollo Router's usage of Apollo Compiler has been updated so that validation logic processes each named fragment only once, preventing redundant traversal. This has been remediated in apollo-router versions 1.61.2 and 2.1.1.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Prior to 0.1.18, Xgrammar includes a cache for compiled grammars to increase performance with repeated use of the same grammar. This cache is held in memory.

Due to the nature of the heap-based overflow, exploitation of this vulnerability could also lead to remote code execution within the FPC, resulting in complete control of the vulnerable component.

Prior to 6.2.6, 6.1.5, 6.0.15, 5.4.18, and 4.5.13, the contents of arbitrary files can be returned to the browser if the dev server is running on Node or Bun. HTTP 1.1 spec (RFC 9112) does not allow # in request-target. Although an attacker can send such a request. For those requests with an invalid request-line (it includes request-target), the spec recommends to reject them with 400 or 301. The same can be said for HTTP 2. On Node and Bun, those requests are not rejected internally and is passed to the user land. For those requests, the value of http.IncomingMessage.url contains #. Vite assumed req.url won't contain # when checking server.fs.deny, allowing those kinds of requests to bypass the check. Only apps explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network (using --host or server.host config option) and running the Vite dev server on runtimes that are not Deno (e.g. Node, Bun) are affected.

When admins change Snowflake connection details in Metabase (either updating a password or changing password to private key or vice versa), Metabase would not always purge older Snowflake connection details from the application database. In order to remove older and stale connection details, Metabase would try one connection method at a time and purge all the other connection methods from the application database. When Metabase found a connection that worked, it would log (log/infof ""Successfully connected, migrating to: %s"" (pr-str test-details)) which would then print the username and password to the logger. This is fixed in 52.17.1, 53.9.5 and 54.1.5 in both the OSS and enterprise editions. Versions 51 and lower are not impacted."

CVE-2025-0123	2025-04-11T18:15:38.610	2025-04-15T18:39:43.697	"A vulnerability in the Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS® software enables unlicensed administrators to view clear-text data captured using the  packet capture feature https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-0/pan-os-admin/monitoring/take-packet-captures/take-a-custom-packet-capture  in decrypted HTTP/2 data streams traversing network interfaces on the firewall. HTTP/1.1 data streams are not impacted.

In normal conditions, decrypted packet captures are available to firewall administrators after they obtain and install a free Decryption Port Mirror license. The license requirement ensures that this feature can only be used after approved personnel purposefully activate the license. For more information, review how to  configure decryption port mirroring https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/decryption/administration/monitoring-decryption/configure-decryption-port-mirroring .

The administrator must obtain network access to the management interface (web, SSH, console, or telnet) and successfully authenticate to exploit this issue. Risk of this issue can be greatly reduced by restricting access to the management interface to only trusted administrators and from only internal IP addresses according to our recommended  critical deployment guidelines https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/community-blogs/tips-amp-tricks-how-to-secure-the-management-access-of-your-palo/ba-p/464431 .

Customer firewall administrators do not have access to the packet capture feature in Cloud NGFW. This feature is available only to authorized Palo Alto Networks personnel permitted to perform troubleshooting.

Prior to 0.6.1, AutoGPT allows SSRF due to DNS Rebinding in requests wrapper. AutoGPT is built with a wrapper around Python's requests library, hardening the application against SSRF. The code for this wrapper can be found in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/util/request.py. The requested hostname of a URL which is being requested is validated, ensuring that it does not resolve to any local ipv4 or ipv6 addresses. However, this check is not sufficient, as a DNS server may initially respond with a non-blocked address, with a TTL of 0. This means that the initial resolution would appear as a non-blocked address. In this case, validate_url() will return the url as successful. After validate_url() has successfully returned the url, the url is then passed to the real request() function. When the real request() function is called with the validated url, request() will once again resolve the address of the hostname, because the record will not have been cached (due to TTL 0). This resolution may be in the ""invalid range"". This type of attack is called a ""DNS Rebinding Attack"".

CVE-2025-31491	2025-04-15T00:15:14.607	2025-08-05T17:04:15.657	AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. Prior to 0.6.1, AutoGPT allows of leakage of cross-domain cookies and protected headers in requests redirect. AutoGPT uses a wrapper around the requests python library, located in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/util/request.py. In this wrapper, redirects are specifically NOT followed for the first request. If the wrapper is used with allow_redirects set to True (which is the default), any redirect is not followed by the initial request, but rather re-requested by the wrapper using the new location. However, there is a fundamental flaw in manually re-requesting the new location: it does not account for security-sensitive headers which should not be sent cross-origin, such as the Authorization and Proxy-Authorization header, and cookies. For example in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/blocks/github/_api.py, an Authorization header is set when retrieving data from the GitHub API. However, if GitHub suffers from an open redirect vulnerability (such as the made-up example of https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/{comment_id}/../../../../../redirect/?url=https://joshua.hu/), and the script can be coerced into visiting it with the Authorization header, the GitHub credentials in the Authorization header will be leaked. This allows leaking auth headers and private cookies. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.1.	8.6	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

The AutoGPT Platform's WebSocket API transmitted node execution updates to subscribers based on the graph_id+graph_version. Additionally, there was no check prohibiting users from subscribing with another user's graph_id+graph_version. As a result, node execution updates from one user's graph execution could be received by another user within the same instance. This vulnerability does not occur between different instances or between users and non-users of the platform. Single-user instances are not affected. In private instances with a user white-list, the impact is limited by the fact that all potential unintended recipients of these node execution updates must have been admitted by the administrator.

CVE-2025-30206	2025-04-15T20:15:39.127	2025-04-16T13:25:59.640	Dpanel is a Docker visualization panel system which provides complete Docker management functions. The Dpanel service contains a hardcoded JWT secret in its default configuration, allowing attackers to generate valid JWT tokens and compromise the host machine. This security flaw allows attackers to analyze the source code, discover the embedded secret, and craft legitimate JWT tokens. By forging these tokens, an attacker can successfully bypass authentication mechanisms, impersonate privileged users, and gain unauthorized administrative access. Consequently, this enables full control over the host machine, potentially leading to severe consequences such as sensitive data exposure, unauthorized command execution, privilege escalation, or further lateral movement within the network environment. This issue is patched in version 1.6.1. A workaround for this vulnerability involves replacing the hardcoded secret with a securely generated value and load it from secure configuration storage.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

The Document Conversion Service contains a critical XML External Entity (XXE) Injection vulnerability in its document conversion functionality. The service processes XML files during the conversion process but fails to disable external entity processing, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. This vulnerability could allow attackers to read sensitive files from the server's filesystem, potentially exposing configuration files, credentials, or other confidential information. Additionally, depending on the server configuration, this could potentially be used to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks by making the server connect to internal services. This issue is patched in version 1.2.4. A workaround for this vulnerability includes disabling external entity processing in the XML parser by setting the appropriate security features (e.g., XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING).	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2025-32012	2025-04-15T20:15:39.400	2025-10-06T16:49:44.703	Jellyfin is an open source self hosted media server. In versions 10.9.0 to before 10.10.7, the /System/Restart endpoint provides administrators the ability to restart their Jellyfin server. This endpoint is intended to be admins-only, but it also authorizes requests from any device in the same local network as the Jellyfin server. Due to the method Jellyfin uses to determine the source IP of a request, an unauthenticated attacker is able to spoof their IP to appear as a LAN IP, allowing them to restart the Jellyfin server process without authentication. This means that an unauthenticated attacker could mount a denial-of-service attack on any default-configured Jellyfin server by simply sending the same spoofed request every few seconds to restart the server over and over. This method of IP spoofing also bypasses some security mechanisms, cause a denial-of-service attack, and possible bypass the admin restart requirement if combined with remote code execution.

Even during normal usage, every track change and playback event would leave behind zombie processes. This leads to inevitable resource exhaustion over time as the system's process table fills up, eventually preventing new processes from being created. The issue is exacerbated if events occur rapidly, whether through normal use (e.g., skipping through a playlist) or potential manipulation of the Deezer Connect protocol traffic.

CVE-2025-31499	2025-04-15T21:16:03.937	2025-10-06T16:42:39.490	Jellyfin is an open source self hosted media server. Versions before 10.10.7 are vulnerable to argument injection in FFmpeg. This can be leveraged to possibly achieve remote code execution by anyone with credentials to a low-privileged user. This vulnerability was previously reported in CVE-2023-49096 and patched in version 10.8.13, but the patch can be bypassed. The original fix sanitizes some parameters to make injection impossible, but certain unsanitized parameters can still be used for argument injection. The same unauthenticated endpoints are vulnerable: /Videos/<itemId>/stream and /Videos/<itemId>/stream.<container>, likely alongside similar endpoints in AudioController. This argument injection can be exploited to achieve arbitrary file write, leading to possible remote code execution through the plugin system. While the unauthenticated endpoints are vulnerable, a valid itemId is required for exploitation and any authenticated attacker could easily retrieve a valid itemId to make the exploit work.

A command injection vulnerability exists in the screenshot API of the Web Check project (Lissy93/web-check). The issue stems from user-controlled input (url) being passed unsanitized into a shell command using exec(), allowing attackers to execute arbitrary system commands on the underlying host. This could be exploited by sending crafted url parameters to extract files or even establish remote access. The vulnerability has been patched by replacing exec() with execFile(), which avoids using a shell and properly isolates arguments.

The confirmation flow for account creation currently uses a GET request triggered by clicking a link sent via email. Some email clients and security tools (e.g., Outlook, virus scanners, and email previewers) may automatically follow these links, unintentionally confirming the account. This allows an attacker to register an account using another user’s email and potentially have it auto-confirmed by the victim’s email client. This does not allow attackers to take over or access existing accounts or private data. It is limited to account confirmation of new accounts only.

CVE-2025-32784	2025-04-15T22:15:28.157	2025-04-16T13:25:37.340	conda-forge-webservices is the web app deployed to run conda-forge admin commands and linting. In versions prior to 2025.4.10, a race condition vulnerability has been identified in the conda-forge-webservices component used within the shared build infrastructure. This vulnerability, categorized as a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) issue, can be exploited to introduce unauthorized modifications to build artifacts stored in the cf-staging Anaconda channel. Exploitation may result in the unauthorized publication of malicious artifacts to the production conda-forge channel. The core vulnerability results from the absence of atomicity between the hash validation and the artifact copy operation. This gap allows an attacker, with access to the cf-staging token, to overwrite the validated artifact with a malicious version immediately after hash verification, but before the copy action is executed. As the cf-staging channel permits artifact overwrites, such an operation can be carried out using the anaconda upload --force command. This vulnerability is fixed in 2025.4.10.

netfilter: socket: Lookup orig tuple for IPv6 SNAT

nf_sk_lookup_slow_v4 does the conntrack lookup for IPv4 packets to
restore the original 5-tuple in case of SNAT, to be able to find the
right socket (if any). Then socket_match() can correctly check whether
the socket was transparent.

However, the IPv6 counterpart (nf_sk_lookup_slow_v6) lacks this
conntrack lookup, making xt_socket fail to match on the socket when the
packet was SNATed. Add the same logic to nf_sk_lookup_slow_v6.

IPv6 SNAT is used in Kubernetes clusters for pod-to-world packets, as
pods' addresses are in the fd00::/8 ULA subnet and need to be replaced
with the node's external address. Cilium leverages Envoy to enforce L7
policies, and Envoy uses transparent sockets. Cilium inserts an iptables
prerouting rule that matches on `-m socket --transparent` and redirects
the packets to localhost, but it fails to match SNATed IPv6 packets due
to that missing conntrack lookup."

usb: xhci: Apply the link chain quirk on NEC isoc endpoints

Two clearly different specimens of NEC uPD720200 (one with start/stop
bug, one without) were seen to cause IOMMU faults after some Missed
Service Errors. Faulting address is immediately after a transfer ring
segment and patched dynamic debug messages revealed that the MSE was
received when waiting for a TD near the end of that segment:

It gets even funnier if the next page is a ring segment accessible to
the HC. Below, it reports MSE in segment at ff1e8000, plows through a
zero-filled page at ff1e9000 and starts reporting events for TRBs in
page at ff1ea000 every microframe, instead of jumping to seg ff1e6000.

It's possible that data from the isochronous device were written to
random buffers of pending TDs on other endpoints (either IN or OUT),
other devices or even other HCs in the same IOMMU domain.

Lastly, an error from a different USB device on another HC. Was it
caused by the above? I don't know, but it may have been. The disk
was working without any other issues and generated PCIe traffic to
starve the NEC of upstream BW and trigger those MSEs. The two HCs
shared one x1 slot by means of a commercial ""PCIe splitter"" board.

Fortunately, it appears that this ridiculous bug is avoided by setting
the chain bit of Link TRBs on isochronous rings. Other ancient HCs are
known which also expect the bit to be set and they ignore Link TRBs if
it's not. Reportedly, 0.95 spec guaranteed that the bit is set.

The bandwidth-starved NEC HC running a 32KB/uframe UVC endpoint reports
tens of MSEs per second and runs into the bug within seconds. Chaining
Link TRBs allows the same workload to run for many minutes, many times.

CVE-2025-22023	2025-04-16T11:15:42.987	2025-04-16T13:25:37.340	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: xhci: Don't skip on Stopped - Length Invalid

Up until commit d56b0b2ab142 (""usb: xhci: ensure skipped isoc TDs are
returned when isoc ring is stopped"") in v6.11, the driver didn't skip
missed isochronous TDs when handling Stoppend and Stopped - Length
Invalid events. Instead, it erroneously cleared the skip flag, which
would cause the ring to get stuck, as future events won't match the
missed TD which is never removed from the queue until it's cancelled.

This buggy logic seems to have been in place substantially unchanged
since the 3.x series over 10 years ago, which probably speaks first
and foremost about relative rarity of this case in normal usage, but
by the spec I see no reason why it shouldn't be possible.

After d56b0b2ab142, TDs are immediately skipped when handling those
Stopped events. This poses a potential problem in case of Stopped -
Length Invalid, which occurs either on completed TDs (likely already
given back) or Link and No-Op TRBs. Such event won't be recognized
as matching any TD (unless it's the rare Link TRB inside a TD) and
will result in skipping all pending TDs, giving them back possibly
before they are done, risking isoc data loss and maybe UAF by HW.

As a compromise, don't skip and don't clear the skip flag on this
kind of event. Then the next event will skip missed TDs. A downside
of not handling Stopped - Length Invalid on a Link inside a TD is
that if the TD is cancelled, its actual length will not be updated
to account for TRBs (silently) completed before the TD was stopped.

I had no luck producing this sequence of completion events so there
is no compelling demonstration of any resulting disaster. It may be
a very rare, obscure condition. The sole motivation for this patch
is that if such unlikely event does occur, I'd rather risk reporting
a cancelled partially done isoc frame as empty than gamble with UAF.

This will be fixed more properly by looking at Stopped event's TRB
pointer when making skipping decisions, but such rework is unlikely
to be backported to v6.12, which will stay around for a few years."

PCI/ASPM: Fix link state exit during switch upstream function removal

Before 456d8aa37d0f (""PCI/ASPM: Disable ASPM on MFD function removal to
avoid use-after-free""), we would free the ASPM link only after the last
function on the bus pertaining to the given link was removed.

That was too late. If function 0 is removed before sibling function,
link->downstream would point to free'd memory after.

After above change, we freed the ASPM parent link state upon any function
removal on the bus pertaining to a given link.

That is too early. If the link is to a PCIe switch with MFD on the upstream
port, then removing functions other than 0 first would free a link which
still remains parent_link to the remaining downstream ports.

The resulting GPFs are especially frequent during hot-unplug, because
pciehp removes devices on the link bus in reverse order.

On that switch, function 0 is the virtual P2P bridge to the internal bus.
Free exactly when function 0 is removed -- before the parent link is
obsolete, but after all subordinate links are gone.

wifi: ath11k: fix RCU stall while reaping monitor destination ring

While processing the monitor destination ring, MSDUs are reaped from the
link descriptor based on the corresponding buf_id.

However, sometimes the driver cannot obtain a valid buffer corresponding
to the buf_id received from the hardware. This causes an infinite loop
in the destination processing, resulting in a kernel crash.

kernel log:

the same function, which means there is a race condition. It occurs due
to the incorrect order of actions in the streamzap_disconnect() function:
rc_unregister_device() is called before usb_kill_urb(). The dev->raw
pointer is freed and set to NULL in rc_unregister_device(), and only
after that usb_kill_urb() waits for in-progress requests to finish.

If rc_unregister_device() is called while streamzap_callback() handler is
not finished, this can lead to accessing freed resources. Thus
rc_unregister_device() should be called after usb_kill_urb().

media: vimc: skip .s_stream() for stopped entities

Syzbot reported [1] a warning prompted by a check in call_s_stream()

Add a simple fix in vimc_streamer_pipeline_terminate() ensuring that
entities skip a call to .s_stream() unless they have been previously
properly started.

CVE-2025-22030	2025-04-16T15:15:55.607	2025-04-17T20:22:16.240	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: zswap: fix crypto_free_acomp() deadlock in zswap_cpu_comp_dead()

Currently, zswap_cpu_comp_dead() calls crypto_free_acomp() while holding
the per-CPU acomp_ctx mutex.  crypto_free_acomp() then holds scomp_lock
(through crypto_exit_scomp_ops_async()).

On the other hand, crypto_alloc_acomp_node() holds the scomp_lock (through
crypto_scomp_init_tfm()), and then allocates memory.  If the allocation
results in reclaim, we may attempt to hold the per-CPU acomp_ctx mutex.

The above dependencies can cause an ABBA deadlock.  For example in the
following scenario:

(1) Task A running on CPU #1:
    crypto_alloc_acomp_node()
      Holds scomp_lock
      Enters reclaim
      Reads per_cpu_ptr(pool->acomp_ctx, 1)

(2) Task A is descheduled

(3) CPU #1 goes offline
    zswap_cpu_comp_dead(CPU #1)
      Holds per_cpu_ptr(pool->acomp_ctx, 1))
      Calls crypto_free_acomp()
      Waits for scomp_lock

(4) Task A running on CPU #2:
      Waits for per_cpu_ptr(pool->acomp_ctx, 1) // Read on CPU #1
      DEADLOCK

Since there is no requirement to call crypto_free_acomp() with the per-CPU
acomp_ctx mutex held in zswap_cpu_comp_dead(), move it after the mutex is
unlocked.  Also move the acomp_request_free() and kfree() calls for
consistency and to avoid any potential sublte locking dependencies in the
future.

With this, only setting acomp_ctx fields to NULL occurs with the mutex
held.  This is similar to how zswap_cpu_comp_prepare() only initializes
acomp_ctx fields with the mutex held, after performing all allocations
before holding the mutex.

Opportunistically, move the NULL check on acomp_ctx so that it takes place
before the mutex dereference."

PCI/bwctrl: Fix NULL pointer dereference on bus number exhaustion

When BIOS neglects to assign bus numbers to PCI bridges, the kernel
attempts to correct that during PCI device enumeration.  If it runs out
of bus numbers, no pci_bus is allocated and the ""subordinate"" pointer in
the bridge's pci_dev remains NULL.

The PCIe bandwidth controller erroneously does not check for a NULL
subordinate pointer and dereferences it on probe.

Bandwidth control of unusable devices below the bridge is of questionable
utility, so simply error out instead.  This mirrors what PCIe hotplug does
since commit 62e4492c3063 (""PCI: Prevent NULL dereference during pciehp
probe"").

The PCI core emits a message with KERN_INFO severity if it has run out of
bus numbers.  PCIe hotplug emits an additional message with KERN_ERR
severity to inform the user that hotplug functionality is disabled at the
bridge.  A similar message for bandwidth control does not seem merited,
given that its only purpose so far is to expose an up-to-date link speed
in sysfs and throttle the link speed on certain laptops with limited
Thermal Design Power.  So error out silently.

mm/gup: reject FOLL_SPLIT_PMD with hugetlb VMAs

Patch series ""mm: fixes for device-exclusive entries (hmm)"", v2.

Discussing the PageTail() call in make_device_exclusive_range() with
Willy, I recently discovered [1] that device-exclusive handling does not
properly work with THP, making the hmm-tests selftests fail if THPs are
enabled on the system.

Looking into more details, I found that hugetlb is not properly fenced,
and I realized that something that was bugging me for longer -- how
device-exclusive entries interact with mapcounts -- completely breaks
migration/swapout/split/hwpoison handling of these folios while they have
device-exclusive PTEs.

The program below can be used to allocate 1 GiB worth of pages and making
them device-exclusive on a kernel with CONFIG_TEST_HMM.

Once they are device-exclusive, these folios cannot get swapped out
(proc$pid/smaps_rollup will always indicate 1 GiB RSS no matter how much
one forces memory reclaim), and when having a memory block onlined to
ZONE_MOVABLE, trying to offline it will loop forever and complain about
failed migration of a page that should be movable.

This series fixes all issues I found so far.  There is no easy way to fix
without a bigger rework/cleanup.  I have a bunch of cleanups on top (some
previous sent, some the result of the discussion in v1) that I will send
out separately once this landed and I get to it.

I wish we could just use some special present PROT_NONE PTEs instead of
these (non-present, non-none) fake-swap entries; but that just results in
the same problem we keep having (lack of spare PTE bits), and staring at
other similar fake-swap entries, that ship has sailed.

With this series, make_device_exclusive() doesn't actually belong into
mm/rmap.c anymore, but I'll leave moving that for another day.

I only tested this series with the hmm-tests selftests due to lack of HW,
so I'd appreciate some testing, especially if the interaction between two
GPUs wanting a device-exclusive entry works as expected.

tracing: Fix use-after-free in print_graph_function_flags during tracer switching

Kairui reported a UAF issue in print_graph_function_flags() during
ftrace stress testing [1]. This issue can be reproduced if puting a
'mdelay(10)' after 'mutex_unlock(&trace_types_lock)' in s_start(),
and executing the following script:

  $ echo function_graph > current_tracer
  $ cat trace > /dev/null &
  $ sleep 5  # Ensure the 'cat' reaches the 'mdelay(10)' point
  $ echo timerlat > current_tracer

The root cause lies in the two calls to print_graph_function_flags
within print_trace_line during each s_show():

  * One through 'iter->trace->print_line()';
  * Another through 'event->funcs->trace()', which is hidden in
    print_trace_fmt() before print_trace_line returns.

Tracer switching only updates the former, while the latter continues
to use the print_line function of the old tracer, which in the script
above is print_graph_function_flags.

Moreover, when switching from the 'function_graph' tracer to the
'timerlat' tracer, s_start only calls graph_trace_close of the
'function_graph' tracer to free 'iter->private', but does not set
it to NULL. This provides an opportunity for 'event->funcs->trace()'
to use an invalid 'iter->private'.

To fix this issue, set 'iter->private' to NULL immediately after
freeing it in graph_trace_close(), ensuring that an invalid pointer
is not passed to other tracers. Additionally, clean up the unnecessary
'iter->private = NULL' during each 'cat trace' when using wakeup and
irqsoff tracers.

call get_block again.

Syzkaller has reported a warning in to_nfit_bus_uuid(): ""only secondary
bus families can be translated"". This warning is emited if the argument
is equal to NVDIMM_BUS_FAMILY_NFIT == 0. Function acpi_nfit_ctl() first
verifies that a user-provided value call_pkg->nd_family of type u64 is
not equal to 0. Then the value is converted to int, and only after that
is compared to NVDIMM_BUS_FAMILY_MAX. This can lead to passing an invalid
argument to acpi_nfit_ctl(), if call_pkg->nd_family is non-zero, while
the lower 32 bits are zero.

Furthermore, it is best to return EINVAL immediately upon seeing the
invalid user input.  The WARNING is insufficient to prevent further
undefined behavior based on other invalid user input.

All checks of the input value should be applied to the original variable
call_pkg->nd_family.

x86/mm: Fix flush_tlb_range() when used for zapping normal PMDs

On the following path, flush_tlb_range() can be used for zapping normal
PMD entries (PMD entries that point to page tables) together with the PTE
entries in the pointed-to page table:

    collapse_pte_mapped_thp
      pmdp_collapse_flush
        flush_tlb_range

The arm64 version of flush_tlb_range() has a comment describing that it can
be used for page table removal, and does not use any last-level
invalidation optimizations. Fix the X86 version by making it behave the
same way.

Currently, X86 only uses this information for the following two purposes,
which I think means the issue doesn't have much impact:

 - In native_flush_tlb_multi() for checking if lazy TLB CPUs need to be
   IPI'd to avoid issues with speculative page table walks.
 - In Hyper-V TLB paravirtualization, again for lazy TLB stuff.

is currently under review (see

netfilter: nft_tunnel: fix geneve_opt type confusion addition

When handling multiple NFTA_TUNNEL_KEY_OPTS_GENEVE attributes, the
parsing logic should place every geneve_opt structure one by one
compactly. Hence, when deciding the next geneve_opt position, the
pointer addition should be in units of char *.

However, the current implementation erroneously does type conversion
before the addition, which will lead to heap out-of-bounds write.

CVE-2025-22058	2025-04-16T15:15:59.277	2025-04-17T20:22:16.240	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

udp: Fix memory accounting leak.

Matt Dowling reported a weird UDP memory usage issue.

Under normal operation, the UDP memory usage reported in /proc/net/sockstat
remains close to zero.  However, it occasionally spiked to 524,288 pages
and never dropped.  Moreover, the value doubled when the application was
terminated.  Finally, it caused intermittent packet drops.

We can reproduce the issue with the script below [0]:

  1. /proc/net/sockstat reports 0 pages

    # cat /proc/net/sockstat | grep UDP:
    UDP: inuse 1 mem 0

  2. Run the script till the report reaches 524,288

    # python3 test.py & sleep 5
    # cat /proc/net/sockstat | grep UDP:
    UDP: inuse 3 mem 524288  <-- (INT_MAX + 1) >> PAGE_SHIFT

  3. Kill the socket and confirm the number never drops

    # pkill python3 && sleep 5
    # cat /proc/net/sockstat | grep UDP:
    UDP: inuse 1 mem 524288

  4. (necessary since v6.0) Trigger proto_memory_pcpu_drain()

    # python3 test.py & sleep 1 && pkill python3

  5. The number doubles

    # cat /proc/net/sockstat | grep UDP:
    UDP: inuse 1 mem 1048577

The application set INT_MAX to SO_RCVBUF, which triggered an integer
overflow in udp_rmem_release().

When a socket is close()d, udp_destruct_common() purges its receive
queue and sums up skb->truesize in the queue.  This total is calculated
and stored in a local unsigned integer variable.

The total size is then passed to udp_rmem_release() to adjust memory
accounting.  However, because the function takes a signed integer
argument, the total size can wrap around, causing an overflow.

Then, the released amount is calculated as follows:

  1) Add size to sk->sk_forward_alloc.
  2) Round down sk->sk_forward_alloc to the nearest lower multiple of
      PAGE_SIZE and assign it to amount.
  3) Subtract amount from sk->sk_forward_alloc.
  4) Pass amount >> PAGE_SHIFT to __sk_mem_reduce_allocated().

When the issue occurred, the total in udp_destruct_common() was 2147484480
(INT_MAX + 833), which was cast to -2147482816 in udp_rmem_release().

At 1) sk->sk_forward_alloc is changed from 3264 to -2147479552, and
2) sets -2147479552 to amount.  3) reverts the wraparound, so we don't
see a warning in inet_sock_destruct().  However, udp_memory_allocated
ends up doubling at 4).

Since commit 3cd3399dd7a8 (""net: implement per-cpu reserves for
memory_allocated""), memory usage no longer doubles immediately after
a socket is close()d because __sk_mem_reduce_allocated() caches the
amount in udp_memory_per_cpu_fw_alloc.  However, the next time a UDP
socket receives a packet, the subtraction takes effect, causing UDP
memory usage to double.

This issue makes further memory allocation fail once the socket's
sk->sk_rmem_alloc exceeds net.ipv4.udp_rmem_min, resulting in packet
drops.

To prevent this issue, let's use unsigned int for the calculation and
call sk_forward_alloc_add() only once for the small delta.

Note that first_packet_length() also potentially has the same problem.

CVE-2025-22059	2025-04-16T15:15:59.380	2025-10-01T18:15:43.800	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

udp: Fix multiple wraparounds of sk->sk_rmem_alloc.

__udp_enqueue_schedule_skb() has the following condition:

  if (atomic_read(&sk->sk_rmem_alloc) > sk->sk_rcvbuf)
          goto drop;

sk->sk_rcvbuf is initialised by net.core.rmem_default and later can
be configured by SO_RCVBUF, which is limited by net.core.rmem_max,
or SO_RCVBUFFORCE.

If we set INT_MAX to sk->sk_rcvbuf, the condition is always false
as sk->sk_rmem_alloc is also signed int.

Then, the size of the incoming skb is added to sk->sk_rmem_alloc
unconditionally.

This results in integer overflow (possibly multiple times) on
sk->sk_rmem_alloc and allows a single socket to have skb up to
net.core.udp_mem[1].

For example, if we set a large value to udp_mem[1] and INT_MAX to
sk->sk_rcvbuf and flood packets to the socket, we can see multiple
overflows:

  # cat /proc/net/sockstat | grep UDP:
  UDP: inuse 3 mem 7956736  <-- (7956736 << 12) bytes > INT_MAX * 15
                                             ^- PAGE_SHIFT
  # ss -uam
  State  Recv-Q      ...
  UNCONN -1757018048 ...    <-- flipping the sign repeatedly
         skmem:(r2537949248,rb2147483646,t0,tb212992,f1984,w0,o0,bl0,d0)

Previously, we had a boundary check for INT_MAX, which was removed by
commit 6a1f12dd85a8 (""udp: relax atomic operation on sk->sk_rmem_alloc"").

A complete fix would be to revert it and cap the right operand by
INT_MAX:

  rmem = atomic_add_return(size, &sk->sk_rmem_alloc);
  if (rmem > min(size + (unsigned int)sk->sk_rcvbuf, INT_MAX))
          goto uncharge_drop;

but we do not want to add the expensive atomic_add_return() back just
for the corner case.

Casting rmem to unsigned int prevents multiple wraparounds, but we still
allow a single wraparound.

  # cat /proc/net/sockstat | grep UDP:
  UDP: inuse 3 mem 524288  <-- (INT_MAX + 1) >> 12

  # ss -uam
  State  Recv-Q      ...
  UNCONN -2147482816 ...   <-- INT_MAX + 831 bytes
         skmem:(r2147484480,rb2147483646,t0,tb212992,f3264,w0,o0,bl0,d14468947)

So, let's define rmem and rcvbuf as unsigned int and check skb->truesize
only when rcvbuf is large enough to lower the overflow possibility.

Note that we still have a small chance to see overflow if multiple skbs
to the same socket are processed on different core at the same time and
each size does not exceed the limit but the total size does.

Note also that we must ignore skb->truesize for a small buffer as
explained in commit 363dc73acacb (""udp: be less conservative with
sock rmem accounting"")."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Both the TCAM and SRAM tables are indirectly accessed by configuring
an index register that selects the row to read or write to. This means
that operations must be atomic in order to, e.g., avoid spreading
writes across multiple rows. Since the shadow SRAM array is used to
find free rows in the hardware table, it must also be protected in
order to avoid TOCTOU errors where multiple cores allocate the same

This issue was detected in a situation where `mvpp2_set_rx_mode()` ran

netlabel: Fix NULL pointer exception caused by CALIPSO on IPv4 sockets

When calling netlbl_conn_setattr(), addr->sa_family is used
to determine the function behavior. If sk is an IPv4 socket,
but the connect function is called with an IPv6 address,
the function calipso_sock_setattr() is triggered.
Inside this function, the following code is executed:

spufs: fix gang directory lifetimes

prior to ""[POWERPC] spufs: Fix gang destroy leaks"" we used to have
a problem with gang lifetimes - creation of a gang returns opened
gang directory, which normally gets removed when that gets closed,
but if somebody has created a context belonging to that gang and
kept it alive until the gang got closed, removal failed and we
ended up with a leak.

Unfortunately, it had been fixed the wrong way.  Dentry of gang
directory was no longer pinned, and rmdir on close was gone.
One problem was that failure of open kept calling simple_rmdir()
as cleanup, which meant an unbalanced dput().  Another bug was
in the success case - gang creation incremented link count on
root directory, but that was no longer undone when gang got
destroyed.

Fix consists of
	* reverting the commit in question
	* adding a counter to gang, protected by ->i_rwsem
of gang directory inode.
	* having it set to 1 at creation time, dropped
in both spufs_dir_close() and spufs_gang_close() and bumped

CVE-2025-22077	2025-04-16T15:16:01.907	2025-04-25T11:15:45.767	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Revert ""smb: client: fix TCP timers deadlock after rmmod""

This reverts commit e9f2517a3e18a54a3943c098d2226b245d488801.

Commit e9f2517a3e18 (""smb: client: fix TCP timers deadlock after
rmmod"") is intended to fix a null-ptr-deref in LOCKDEP, which is
mentioned as CVE-2024-54680, but is actually did not fix anything;
The issue can be reproduced on top of it. [0]

Also, it reverted the change by commit ef7134c7fc48 (""smb: client:
Fix use-after-free of network namespace."") and introduced a real
issue by reviving the kernel TCP socket.

When a reconnect happens for a CIFS connection, the socket state
transitions to FIN_WAIT_1.  Then, inet_csk_clear_xmit_timers_sync()
in tcp_close() stops all timers for the socket.

If an incoming FIN packet is lost, the socket will stay at FIN_WAIT_1
forever, and such sockets could be leaked up to net.ipv4.tcp_max_orphans.

Usually, FIN can be retransmitted by the peer, but if the peer aborts
the connection, the issue comes into reality.

I warned about this privately by pointing out the exact report [1],
but the bogus fix was finally merged.

So, we should not stop the timers to finally kill the connection on
our side in that case, meaning we must not use a kernel socket for
TCP whose sk->sk_net_refcnt is 0.

The kernel socket does not have a reference to its netns to make it
possible to tear down netns without cleaning up every resource in it.

For example, tunnel devices use a UDP socket internally, but we can
destroy netns without removing such devices and let it complete
during exit.  Otherwise, netns would be leaked when the last application
died.

However, this is problematic for TCP sockets because TCP has timers to
close the connection gracefully even after the socket is close()d.  The
lifetime of the socket and its netns is different from the lifetime of
the underlying connection.

If the socket user does not maintain the netns lifetime, the timer could
be fired after the socket is close()d and its netns is freed up, resulting
in use-after-free.

Actually, we have seen so many similar issues and converted such sockets
to have a reference to netns.

That's why I converted the CIFS client socket to have a reference to
netns (sk->sk_net_refcnt == 1), which is somehow mentioned as out-of-scope
of CIFS and technically wrong in e9f2517a3e18, but **is in-scope and right
fix**.

Regarding the LOCKDEP issue, we can prevent the module unload by
bumping the module refcount when switching the LOCKDDEP key in
sock_lock_init_class_and_name(). [2]

For a while, let's revert the bogus fix.

Note that now we can use sk_net_refcnt_upgrade() for the socket
conversion, but I'll do so later separately to make backport easy."

vhost-scsi: Fix handling of multiple calls to vhost_scsi_set_endpoint

If vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called multiple times without a
vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint between them, we can hit multiple bugs
found by Haoran Zhang:

1. Use-after-free when no tpgs are found:

This fixes a use after free that occurs when vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is
called more than once and calls after the first call do not find any
tpgs to add to the vs_tpg. When vhost_scsi_set_endpoint first finds
tpgs to add to the vs_tpg array match=true, so we will do:

vhost_vq_set_backend(vq, vs_tpg);
...

kfree(vs->vs_tpg);
vs->vs_tpg = vs_tpg;

If vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called again and no tpgs are found
match=false so we skip the vhost_vq_set_backend call leaving the
pointer to the vs_tpg we then free via:

kfree(vs->vs_tpg);
vs->vs_tpg = vs_tpg;

If a scsi request is then sent we do:

vhost_scsi_handle_vq -> vhost_scsi_get_req -> vhost_vq_get_backend

which sees the vs_tpg we just did a kfree on.

2. Tpg dir removal hang:

This patch fixes an issue where we cannot remove a LIO/target layer
tpg (and structs above it like the target) dir due to the refcount
dropping to -1.

The problem is that if vhost_scsi_set_endpoint detects a tpg is already
in the vs->vs_tpg array or if the tpg has been removed so
target_depend_item fails, the undepend goto handler will do
target_undepend_item on all tpgs in the vs_tpg array dropping their
refcount to 0. At this time vs_tpg contains both the tpgs we have added
in the current vhost_scsi_set_endpoint call as well as tpgs we added in
previous calls which are also in vs->vs_tpg.

Later, when vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint runs it will do
target_undepend_item on all the tpgs in the vs->vs_tpg which will drop
their refcount to -1. Userspace will then not be able to remove the tpg
and will hang when it tries to do rmdir on the tpg dir.

3. Tpg leak:

This fixes a bug where we can leak tpgs and cause them to be
un-removable because the target name is overwritten when
vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called multiple times but with different
target names.

The bug occurs if a user has called VHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT and setup
a vhost-scsi device to target/tpg mapping, then calls
VHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT again with a new target name that has tpgs we
haven't seen before (target1 has tpg1 but target2 has tpg2). When this
happens we don't teardown the old target tpg mapping and just overwrite
the target name and the vs->vs_tpg array. Later when we do
vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint, we are passed in either target1 or target2's
name and we will only match that target's tpgs when we loop over the
vs->vs_tpg. We will then return from the function without doing
target_undepend_item on the tpgs.

Because of all these bugs, it looks like being able to call
vhost_scsi_set_endpoint multiple times was never supported. The major
user, QEMU, already has checks to prevent this use case. So to fix the
issues, this patch prevents vhost_scsi_set_endpoint from being called
if it's already successfully added tpgs. To add, remove or change the
tpg config or target name, you must do a vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint
first."

When cur_qp isn't NULL, in order to avoid fetching the QP from

the one we already have.

The bug however is that we are checking if the QP is identical by
checking the QP number inside the CQE against the QP number inside the
mlx5_ib_qp, but that's wrong since the QP number from the CQE is from
FW so it should be matched against mlx5_core_qp which is our FW QP
number.

Otherwise we could use the wrong QP when handling a CQE which could
cause the kernel trace below.

This issue is mainly noticeable over QPs 0 & 1, since for now they are
the only QPs in our driver whereas the QP number inside mlx5_ib_qp
doesn't match the QP number inside mlx5_core_qp.

The problem can be reproduced using the following steps:
  ip netns add foo
  ip netns exec foo bash
  cat /sys/class/infiniband/mlx4_0/hw_counters/*

The panic occurs because of casting the device pointer into an
ib_device pointer using container_of() in hw_stat_device_show() is
wrong and leads to a memory corruption.

However the real problem is that hw counters should never been exposed
outside of the non-init net namespace.

Fix this by saving the index of the corresponding attribute group
(it might be 1 or 2 depending on the presence of driver-specific
attributes) and zeroing the pointer to hw_counters group for compat
devices during the initialization.

With this fix applied hw_counters are not available in a non-init
net namespace:
  find /sys/class/infiniband/mlx4_0/ -name hw_counters
    /sys/class/infiniband/mlx4_0/ports/1/hw_counters
    /sys/class/infiniband/mlx4_0/ports/2/hw_counters
    /sys/class/infiniband/mlx4_0/hw_counters

  ip netns add foo
  ip netns exec foo bash
  find /sys/class/infiniband/mlx4_0/ -name hw_counters"

x86/mm/pat: Fix VM_PAT handling when fork() fails in copy_page_range()

If track_pfn_copy() fails, we already added the dst VMA to the maple
tree. As fork() fails, we'll cleanup the maple tree, and stumble over
the dst VMA for which we neither performed any reservation nor copied
any page tables.

Consequently untrack_pfn() will see VM_PAT and try obtaining the
PAT information from the page table -- which fails because the page
table was not copied.

The easiest fix would be to simply clear the VM_PAT flag of the dst VMA
if track_pfn_copy() fails. However, the whole thing is about ""simply""
clearing the VM_PAT flag is shaky as well: if we passed track_pfn_copy()
and performed a reservation, but copying the page tables fails, we'll
simply clear the VM_PAT flag, not properly undoing the reservation ...
which is also wrong.

So let's fix it properly: set the VM_PAT flag only if the reservation
succeeded (leaving it clear initially), and undo the reservation if
anything goes wrong while copying the page tables: clearing the VM_PAT
flag after undoing the reservation.

Note that any copied page table entries will get zapped when the VMA will
get removed later, after copy_page_range() succeeded; as VM_PAT is not set
then, we won't try cleaning VM_PAT up once more and untrack_pfn() will be
happy. Note that leaving these page tables in place without a reservation
is not a problem, as we are aborting fork(); this process will never run.

A reproducer can trigger this usually at the first try:

net: dsa: sja1105: fix kasan out-of-bounds warning in sja1105_table_delete_entry()

There are actually 2 problems:
- deleting the last element doesn't require the memmove of elements
  [i + 1, end) over it. Actually, element i+1 is out of bounds.
- The memmove itself should move size - i - 1 elements, because the last
  element is out of bounds.

The out-of-bounds element still remains out of bounds after being
accessed, so the problem is only that we touch it, not that it becomes
in active use. But I suppose it can lead to issues if the out-of-bounds
element is part of an unmapped page."

ax25: Remove broken autobind

Binding AX25 socket by using the autobind feature leads to memory leaks
in ax25_connect() and also refcount leaks in ax25_release(). Memory
leak was detected with kmemleak:

When socket is bound, refcounts must be incremented the way it is done

autobind, the refcounts are not incremented.

This bug leads to the following issue reported by Syzkaller:

Considering the issues above and the comments left in the code that say:
""check if we can remove this feature. It is broken.""; ""autobinding in this
may or may not work""; - it is better to completely remove this feature than
to fix it because it is broken and leads to various kinds of memory bugs.

Now calling connect() without first binding socket will result in an
error (-EINVAL). Userspace software that relies on the autobind feature
might get broken. However, this feature does not seem widely used with
this specific driver as it was not reliable at any point of time, and it
is already broken anyway. E.g. ax25-tools and ax25-apps packages for
popular distributions do not use the autobind feature for AF_AX25.

net: Remove RTNL dance for SIOCBRADDIF and SIOCBRDELIF.

SIOCBRDELIF is passed to dev_ioctl() first and later forwarded to
br_ioctl_call(), which causes unnecessary RTNL dance and the splat
below [0] under RTNL pressure.

Let's say Thread A is trying to detach a device from a bridge and
Thread B is trying to remove the bridge.

In dev_ioctl(), Thread A bumps the bridge device's refcnt by
netdev_hold() and releases RTNL because the following br_ioctl_call()
also re-acquires RTNL.

In the race window, Thread B could acquire RTNL and try to remove
the bridge device.  Then, rtnl_unlock() by Thread B will release RTNL
and wait for netdev_put() by Thread A.

Thread A, however, must hold RTNL after the unlock in dev_ifsioc(),
which may take long under RTNL pressure, resulting in the splat by
Thread B.

To avoid blocking SIOCBRDELBR unnecessarily, let's not call
dev_ioctl() for SIOCBRADDIF and SIOCBRDELIF.

In the dev_ioctl() path, we do the following:

  1. Copy struct ifreq by get_user_ifreq in sock_do_ioctl()
  2. Check CAP_NET_ADMIN in dev_ioctl()
  3. Call dev_load() in dev_ioctl()
  4. Fetch the master dev from ifr.ifr_name in dev_ifsioc()

3. can be done by request_module() in br_ioctl_call(), so we move
1., 2., and 4. to br_ioctl_stub().

Note that 2. is also checked later in add_del_if(), but it's better
performed before RTNL.

SIOCBRADDIF and SIOCBRDELIF have been processed in dev_ioctl() since
the pre-git era, and there seems to be no specific reason to process
them there.

ext4: avoid journaling sb update on error if journal is destroying

Presently we always BUG_ON if trying to start a transaction on a journal marked
with JBD2_UNMOUNT, since this should never happen. However, while ltp running
stress tests, it was observed that in case of some error handling paths, it is
possible for update_super_work to start a transaction after the journal is
destroyed eg:

    generic_shutdown_super

      evict_inodes
        /* might start a new txn */

	flush_work(&sbi->s_sb_upd_work) /* flush the workqueue */
        jbd2_journal_destroy
          journal_kill_thread
            journal->j_flags |= JBD2_UNMOUNT;
          jbd2_journal_commit_transaction

              jbd2_journal_bmap

                  ext4_map_blocks

                    ext4_inode_error

                        schedule_work(&sbi->s_sb_upd_work)

                                               /* work queue kicks in */
                                               update_super_work
                                                 jbd2_journal_start

Hence, introduce a new mount flag to indicate journal is destroying and only do
a journaled (and deferred) update of sb if this flag is not set. Otherwise, just
fallback to an un-journaled commit.

Further, in the journal destroy path, we have the following sequence:

  1. Set mount flag indicating journal is destroying
  2. force a commit and wait for it
  3. flush pending sb updates

This sequence is important as it ensures that, after this point, there is no sb
update that might be journaled so it is safe to update the sb outside the
journal. (To avoid race discussed in 2d01ddc86606)

Also, we don't need a similar check in ext4_grp_locked_error since it is only
called from mballoc and AFAICT it would be always valid to schedule work here."

btrfs: fix block group refcount race in btrfs_create_pending_block_groups()

Block group creation is done in two phases, which results in a slightly
unintuitive property: a block group can be allocated/deallocated from
after btrfs_make_block_group() adds it to the space_info with
btrfs_add_bg_to_space_info(), but before creation is completely completed
in btrfs_create_pending_block_groups(). As a result, it is possible for a
block group to go unused and have 'btrfs_mark_bg_unused' called on it
concurrently with 'btrfs_create_pending_block_groups'. This causes a
number of issues, which were fixed with the block group flag
'BLOCK_GROUP_FLAG_NEW'.

However, this fix is not quite complete. Since it does not use the
unused_bg_lock, it is possible for the following race to occur:

btrfs_create_pending_block_groups            btrfs_mark_bg_unused
                                           if list_empty // false
        list_del_init
        clear_bit
                                           else if (test_bit) // true
                                                list_move_tail

And we get into the exact same broken ref count and invalid new_bgs
state for transaction cleanup that BLOCK_GROUP_FLAG_NEW was designed to
prevent.

The broken refcount aspect will result in a warning like:

Concurrent pinfile allocation may run out of free section, result in
panic in get_new_segment(), let's expand pin_sem lock coverage to
include f2fs_gc(), so that we can make sure to reclaim enough free
space for following allocation.

In addition, do below changes to enhance error path handling:
- call f2fs_bug_on() only in non-pinfile allocation path in
get_new_segment().
- call reset_curseg_fields() to reset all fields of curseg in
new_curseg()"

dlm: prevent NPD when writing a positive value to event_done

do_uevent returns the value written to event_done. In case it is a
positive value, new_lockspace would undo all the work, and lockspace
would not be set. __dlm_new_lockspace, however, would treat that
positive value as a success due to commit 8511a2728ab8 (""dlm: fix use
count with multiple joins"").

Down the line, device_create_lockspace would pass that NULL lockspace to
dlm_find_lockspace_local, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

Treating such positive values as successes prevents the problem. Given
this has been broken for so long, this is unlikely to break userspace
expectations."

If checkpoint comes from mount/umount/remount/freeze/quotactl, caller of
checkpoint has already held s_umount lock, calling dquot_writeback_dquots()
in the context should be safe.

So let's record task to sbi->umount_lock_holder, so that checkpoint can
know whether the lock has held in the context or not by checking current

In addition, in order to not misrepresent caller of checkpoint, we should
not allow to trigger async checkpoint for those callers: mount/umount/remount/
freeze/quotactl."

wifi: ath11k: update channel list in reg notifier instead reg worker

Currently when ath11k gets a new channel list, it will be processed
according to the following steps:
1. update new channel list to cfg80211 and queue reg_work.
2. cfg80211 handles new channel list during reg_work.
3. update cfg80211's handled channel list to firmware by
ath11k_reg_update_chan_list().

But ath11k will immediately execute step 3 after reg_work is just
queued. Since step 2 is asynchronous, cfg80211 may not have completed
handling the new channel list, which may leading to an out-of-bounds
write error:

Wen raised patch[1]. When flag NL80211_REGDOM_SET_BY_DRIVER is set,
cfg80211 will notify ath11k after step 2 is done.

So enable the flag NL80211_REGDOM_SET_BY_DRIVER then cfg80211 will
notify ath11k after step 2 is done. At this time, there will be no
KASAN bug during the execution of the step 3.

The infamous mmap_lock taken in copy_from/to_user() can be often

In the case of ALSA timer code, the bad pattern is with
guard(mutex)(&register_mutex) that covers copy_from/to_user() -- which
was mistakenly introduced at converting to guard(), and it had been
carefully worked around in the past.

This patch fixes those pieces simply by moving copy_from/to_user() out

watch_queue: fix pipe accounting mismatch

Currently, watch_queue_set_size() modifies the pipe buffers charged to
user->pipe_bufs without updating the pipe->nr_accounted on the pipe
itself, due to the if (!pipe_has_watch_queue()) test in
pipe_resize_ring(). This means that when the pipe is ultimately freed,
we decrement user->pipe_bufs by something other than what than we had
charged to it, potentially leading to an underflow. This in turn can
cause subsequent too_many_pipe_buffers_soft() tests to fail with -EPERM.

To remedy this, explicitly account for the pipe usage in
watch_queue_set_size() to match the number set via account_pipe_buffers()

(It's unclear why watch_queue_set_size() does not update nr_accounted;
it may be due to intentional overprovisioning in watch_queue_set_size()?)"

CVE-2020-36789	2025-04-17T18:15:42.743	2025-10-01T17:15:31.817	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: dev: can_get_echo_skb(): prevent call to kfree_skb() in hard IRQ context

If a driver calls can_get_echo_skb() during a hardware IRQ (which is often, but
not always, the case), the 'WARN_ON(in_irq)' in
net/core/skbuff.c#skb_release_head_state() might be triggered, under network
congestion circumstances, together with the potential risk of a NULL pointer
dereference.

The root cause of this issue is the call to kfree_skb() instead of
dev_kfree_skb_irq() in net/core/dev.c#enqueue_to_backlog().

This patch prevents the skb to be freed within the call to netif_rx() by
incrementing its reference count with skb_get(). The skb is finally freed by
one of the in-irq-context safe functions: dev_consume_skb_any() or
dev_kfree_skb_any(). The ""any"" version is used because some drivers might call
can_get_echo_skb() in a normal context.

The reason for this issue to occur is that initially, in the core network
stack, loopback skb were not supposed to be received in hardware IRQ context.
The CAN stack is an exeption.

This bug was previously reported back in 2017 in [1] but the proposed patch
never got accepted.

While [1] directly modifies net/core/dev.c, we try to propose here a
smoother modification local to CAN network stack (the assumption
behind is that only CAN devices are affected by this issue).

can: etas_es58x: es58x_rx_err_msg(): fix memory leak in error path

In es58x_rx_err_msg(), if can->do_set_mode() fails, the function
directly returns without calling netif_rx(skb). This means that the
skb previously allocated by alloc_can_err_skb() is not freed. In other
terms, this is a memory leak.

This patch simply removes the return statement in the error branch and
let the function continue.

CVE-2025-37785	2025-04-18T07:15:42.693	2025-05-02T07:16:03.590	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix OOB read when checking dotdot dir

Mounting a corrupted filesystem with directory which contains '.' dir
entry with rec_len == block size results in out-of-bounds read (later
on, when the corrupted directory is removed).

ext4_empty_dir() assumes every ext4 directory contains at least '.'
and '..' as directory entries in the first data block. It first loads
the '.' dir entry, performs sanity checks by calling ext4_check_dir_entry()
and then uses its rec_len member to compute the location of '..' dir
entry (in ext4_next_entry). It assumes the '..' dir entry fits into the
same data block.

If the rec_len of '.' is precisely one block (4KB), it slips through the
sanity checks (it is considered the last directory entry in the data
block) and leaves ""struct ext4_dir_entry_2 *de"" point exactly past the
memory slot allocated to the data block. The following call to
ext4_check_dir_entry() on new value of de then dereferences this pointer
which results in out-of-bounds mem access.

Fix this by extending __ext4_check_dir_entry() to check for '.' dir
entries that reach the end of data block. Make sure to ignore the phony
dir entries for checksum (by checking name_len for non-zero).

Note: This is reported by KASAN as use-after-free in case another
structure was recently freed from the slot past the bound, but it is
really an OOB read.

This issue was found by syzkaller tool.

x86/resctrl: Fix allocation of cleanest CLOSID on platforms with no monitors

Commit

  6eac36bb9eb0 (""x86/resctrl: Allocate the cleanest CLOSID by searching closid_num_dirty_rmid"")

added logic that causes resctrl to search for the CLOSID with the fewest dirty
cache lines when creating a new control group, if requested by the arch code.
This depends on the values read from the llc_occupancy counters. The logic is
applicable to architectures where the CLOSID effectively forms part of the
monitoring identifier and so do not allow complete freedom to choose an unused
monitoring identifier for a given CLOSID.

This support missed that some platforms may not have these counters.  This
causes a NULL pointer dereference when creating a new control group as the
array was not allocated by dom_data_init().

As this feature isn't necessary on platforms that don't have cache occupancy
monitors, add this to the check that occurs when a new control group is
allocated."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

drm/amdgpu: Replace Mutex with Spinlock for RLCG register access to avoid Priority Inversion in SRIOV

RLCG Register Access is a way for virtual functions to safely access GPU
registers in a virtualized environment., including TLB flushes and
register reads. When multiple threads or VFs try to access the same
registers simultaneously, it can lead to race conditions. By using the
RLCG interface, the driver can serialize access to the registers. This
means that only one thread can access the registers at a time,
preventing conflicts and ensuring that operations are performed
correctly. Additionally, when a low-priority task holds a mutex that a
high-priority task needs, ie., If a thread holding a spinlock tries to
acquire a mutex, it can lead to priority inversion. register access in
amdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw especially in a fast code path is critical.

The call stack shows that the function amdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw is being
called, which attempts to acquire the mutex. This function is invoked
from amdgpu_sriov_wreg, which in turn is called from
gmc_v11_0_flush_gpu_tlb.

The [ BUG: Invalid wait context ] indicates that a thread is trying to
acquire a mutex while it is in a context that does not allow it to sleep
(like holding a spinlock).

net_sched: skbprio: Remove overly strict queue assertions

In the current implementation, skbprio enqueue/dequeue contains an assertion
that fails under certain conditions when SKBPRIO is used as a child qdisc under
TBF with specific parameters. The failure occurs because TBF sometimes peeks at
packets in the child qdisc without actually dequeuing them when tokens are
unavailable.

This peek operation creates a discrepancy between the parent and child qdisc
queue length counters. When TBF later receives a high-priority packet,
SKBPRIO's queue length may show a different value than what's reflected in its
internal priority queue tracking, triggering the assertion.

The fix removes this overly strict assertions in SKBPRIO, they are not
necessary at all."

nfsd: allow SC_STATUS_FREEABLE when searching via nfs4_lookup_stateid()

The pynfs DELEG8 test fails when run against nfsd. It acquires a

deleg stateid and expects to see NFS4ERR_DELEG_REVOKED, but it gets
bad NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID instead.

When a delegation is revoked, it's initially marked with
SC_STATUS_REVOKED, or SC_STATUS_ADMIN_REVOKED and later, it's marked
with the SC_STATUS_FREEABLE flag, which denotes that it is waiting for
s FREE_STATEID call.

nfs4_lookup_stateid() accepts a statusmask that includes the status
flags that a found stateid is allowed to have. Currently, that mask
never includes SC_STATUS_FREEABLE, which means that revoked delegations

jfs: fix slab-out-of-bounds read in ea_get()

During the ""size_check"" label in ea_get(), the code checks if the extended
attribute list (xattr) size matches ea_size. If not, it logs
""ea_get: invalid extended attribute"" and calls print_hex_dump().

Here, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr) returns 4110417968, which exceeds
INT_MAX (2,147,483,647). Then ea_size is clamped:

	int size = clamp_t(int, ea_size, 0, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr));

Although clamp_t aims to bound ea_size between 0 and 4110417968, the upper
limit is treated as an int, causing an overflow above 2^31 - 1. This leads
""size"" to wrap around and become negative (-184549328).

The ""size"" is then passed to print_hex_dump() (called ""len"" in
print_hex_dump()), it is passed as type size_t (an unsigned
type), this is then stored inside a variable called
""int remaining"", which is then assigned to ""int linelen"" which
is then passed to hex_dump_to_buffer(). In print_hex_dump()
the for loop, iterates through 0 to len-1, where len is
18446744073525002176, calling hex_dump_to_buffer()
on each iteration:

	for (i = 0; i < len; i += rowsize) {
		linelen = min(remaining, rowsize);
		remaining -= rowsize;

		hex_dump_to_buffer(ptr + i, linelen, rowsize, groupsize,
				   linebuf, sizeof(linebuf), ascii);

		...
	}

The expected stopping condition (i < len) is effectively broken
since len is corrupted and very large. This eventually leads to
the ""ptr+i"" being passed to hex_dump_to_buffer() to get closer
to the end of the actual bounds of ""ptr"", eventually an out of
bounds access is done in hex_dump_to_buffer() in the following
for loop:

	for (j = 0; j < len; j++) {
			if (linebuflen < lx + 2)
				goto overflow2;
			ch = ptr[j];
		...
	}

x86/mce: use is_copy_from_user() to determine copy-from-user context

Patch series ""mm/hwpoison: Fix regressions in memory failure handling"",
v4.

## 1. What am I trying to do:

This patchset resolves two critical regressions related to memory failure
handling that have appeared in the upstream kernel since version 5.17, as
compared to 5.10 LTS.

    - copyin case: poison found in user page while kernel copying from user space
    - instr case: poison found while instruction fetching in user space

## 2. What is the expected outcome and why

- For copyin case:

Kernel can recover from poison found where kernel is doing get_user() or
copy_from_user() if those places get an error return and the kernel return
-EFAULT to the process instead of crashing.  More specifily, MCE handler
checks the fixup handler type to decide whether an in kernel #MC can be
recovered.  When EX_TYPE_UACCESS is found, the PC jumps to recovery code
specified in _ASM_EXTABLE_FAULT() and return a -EFAULT to user space.

- For instr case:

If a poison found while instruction fetching in user space, full recovery
is possible.  User process takes #PF, Linux allocates a new page and fills
by reading from storage.


## 3. What actually happens and why

- For copyin case: kernel panic since v5.17

Commit 4c132d1d844a (""x86/futex: Remove .fixup usage"") introduced a new
extable fixup type, EX_TYPE_EFAULT_REG, and later patches updated the
extable fixup type for copy-from-user operations, changing it from
EX_TYPE_UACCESS to EX_TYPE_EFAULT_REG.  It breaks previous EX_TYPE_UACCESS
handling when posion found in get_user() or copy_from_user().

- For instr case: user process is killed by a SIGBUS signal due to #CMCI
  and #MCE race

When an uncorrected memory error is consumed there is a race between the
CMCI from the memory controller reporting an uncorrected error with a UCNA
signature, and the core reporting and SRAR signature machine check when
the data is about to be consumed.

### Background: why *UN*corrected errors tied to *C*MCI in Intel platform [1]

Prior to Icelake memory controllers reported patrol scrub events that
detected a previously unseen uncorrected error in memory by signaling a
broadcast machine check with an SRAO (Software Recoverable Action
Optional) signature in the machine check bank.  This was overkill because
it's not an urgent problem that no core is on the verge of consuming that
bad data.  It's also found that multi SRAO UCE may cause nested MCE
interrupts and finally become an IERR.

Hence, Intel downgrades the machine check bank signature of patrol scrub
from SRAO to UCNA (Uncorrected, No Action required), and signal changed to
#CMCI.  Just to add to the confusion, Linux does take an action (in
uc_decode_notifier()) to try to offline the page despite the UC*NA*
signature name.

### Background: why #CMCI and #MCE race when poison is consuming in
    Intel platform [1]

Having decided that CMCI/UCNA is the best action for patrol scrub errors,
the memory controller uses it for reads too.  But the memory controller is
executing asynchronously from the core, and can't tell the difference
between a ""real"" read and a speculative read.  So it will do CMCI/UCNA if
an error is found in any read.

Thus:

1) Core is clever and thinks address A is needed soon, issues a
   speculative read.

2) Core finds it is going to use address A soon after sending the read
   request

3) The CMCI from the memory controller is in a race with MCE from the
   core that will soon try to retire the load from address A.

Quite often (because speculation has got better) the CMCI from the memory
controller is delivered before the core is committed to the instruction
reading address A, so the interrupt is taken, and Linux offlines the page
(marking it as poison).


## Why user process is killed for instr case

HSI: ssi_protocol: Fix use after free vulnerability in ssi_protocol Driver Due to Race Condition

In the ssi_protocol_probe() function, &ssi->work is bound with
ssip_xmit_work(), In ssip_pn_setup(), the ssip_pn_xmit() function
within the ssip_pn_ops structure is capable of starting the
work.

If we remove the module which will call ssi_protocol_remove()
to make a cleanup, it will free ssi through kfree(ssi),
while the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence
of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:

CVE-2025-32431	2025-04-21T16:15:54.610	2025-04-23T14:08:13.383	Traefik (pronounced traffic) is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. In versions prior to 2.11.24, 3.3.6, and 3.4.0-rc2. There is a potential vulnerability in Traefik managing the requests using a PathPrefix, Path or PathRegex matcher. When Traefik is configured to route the requests to a backend using a matcher based on the path, if the URL contains a /../ in its path, it’s possible to target a backend, exposed using another router, by-passing the middlewares chain. This issue has been patched in versions 2.11.24, 3.3.6, and 3.4.0-rc2. A workaround involves adding a `PathRegexp` rule to the matcher to prevent matching a route with a `/../` in the path.

CVE-2025-32955	2025-04-21T21:15:20.507	2025-04-23T14:08:13.383	Harden-Runner is a CI/CD security agent that works like an EDR for GitHub Actions runners. Versions from 0.12.0 to before 2.12.0 are vulnerable to `disable-sudo` bypass. Harden-Runner includes a policy option `disable-sudo` to prevent the GitHub Actions runner user from using sudo. This is implemented by removing the runner user from the sudoers file. However, this control can be bypassed as the runner user, being part of the docker group, can interact with the Docker daemon to launch privileged containers or access the host filesystem. This allows the attacker to regain root access or restore the sudoers file, effectively bypassing the restriction.

Versions 4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, and 4.2.4 of xrpl.js were compromised and contained malicious code designed to exfiltrate private keys. Version 2.14.2 is also malicious, though it is less likely to lead to exploitation as it is not compatible with other 2.x versions. Anyone who used one of these versions should stop immediately and rotate any private keys or secrets used with affected systems. Users of xrpl.js should pgrade to version 4.2.5 or 2.14.3 to receive a patch. To secure funds, think carefully about whether any keys may have been compromised by this supply chain attack, and mitigate by sending funds to secure wallets, and/or rotating keys. If any account's master key is potentially compromised, disable the key.

In versions starting at 2.6 and prior to 7.4.3, An unauthenticated client can cause unlimited growth of output buffers, until the server runs out of memory or is killed. By default, the Redis configuration does not limit the output buffer of normal clients (see client-output-buffer-limit). Therefore, the output buffer can grow unlimitedly over time. As a result, the service is exhausted and the memory is unavailable. When password authentication is enabled on the Redis server, but no password is provided, the client can still cause the output buffer to grow from ""NOAUTH"" responses until the system will run out of memory. This issue has been patched in version 7.4.3. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable is to block access to prevent unauthenticated users from connecting to Redis. This can be done in different ways. Either using network access control tools like firewalls, iptables, security groups, etc, or enabling TLS and requiring users to authenticate using client side certificates."	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Versions of z2d after `0.5.1` and up to and including `0.6.0`, when writing from one surface to another using `z2d.compositor.StrideCompositor.run`, and higher-level operations when the anti-aliasing mode is set to `.default` (such as `Context.fill`, `Context.stroke`, `painter.fill`, and `painter.stroke`), the source surface can be completely out-of-bounds on the x-axis, but not on the y-axis, by way of a negative offset. This results in an overflow of the value controlling the length of the stride. In non-safe optimization modes (consumers compiling with `ReleaseFast` or `ReleaseSmall`), this could potentially lead to invalid memory accesses or corruption.

This issue is patched in version `0.6.1`. Users on an untagged version after `v0.5.1` and before `v0.6.1` are advised to update to address the vulnerability. Those still on Zig `0.13.0` are recommended to downgrade to `v0.5.1`."

An authenticated attacker with member-level permissions could exploit this by uploading a crafted HTML file containing malicious JavaScript. When another user visits the binary data endpoint with the MIME type set to text/html, the script executes in the context of the user’s session. This script could send a request to change the user’s email address in their account settings, effectively enabling account takeover.

CVE-2024-58099	2025-04-29T12:15:31.053	2025-10-01T17:15:38.293	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vmxnet3: Fix packet corruption in vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_frame

Andrew and Nikolay reported connectivity issues with Cilium's service
load-balancing in case of vmxnet3.

If a BPF program for native XDP adds an encapsulation header such as
IPIP and transmits the packet out the same interface, then in case
of vmxnet3 a corrupted packet is being sent and subsequently dropped
on the path.

vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_frame() which is called e.g. via vmxnet3_run_xdp()
through vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_back() calculates an incorrect DMA address:

  page = virt_to_page(xdpf->data);
  tbi->dma_addr = page_pool_get_dma_addr(page) +
                  VMXNET3_XDP_HEADROOM;
  dma_sync_single_for_device(&adapter->pdev->dev,
                             tbi->dma_addr, buf_size,
                             DMA_TO_DEVICE);

The above assumes a fixed offset (VMXNET3_XDP_HEADROOM), but the XDP
BPF program could have moved xdp->data. While the passed buf_size is
correct (xdpf->len), the dma_addr needs to have a dynamic offset which
can be calculated as xdpf->data - (void *)xdpf, that is, xdp->data -
xdp->data_hard_start."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2025-46346	2025-04-29T16:15:36.873	2025-05-09T13:53:56.553	YesWiki is a wiki system written in PHP. Prior to version 4.5.4, a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the application’s comments feature. This issue allows a malicious actor to inject JavaScript payloads that are stored and later executed in the browser of any user viewing the affected comment. The XSS occurs because the application fails to properly sanitize or encode user input submitted to the comments. Notably, the application sanitizes or does not allow execution of `<script>` tags, but does not account for payloads obfuscated using JavaScript block comments like `/* JavaScriptPayload */`.

In a multi-node vLLM deployment, vLLM uses ZeroMQ for some multi-node communication purposes. The primary vLLM host opens an XPUB ZeroMQ socket and binds it to ALL interfaces. While the socket is always opened for a multi-node deployment, it is only used when doing tensor parallelism across multiple hosts. Any client with network access to this host can connect to this XPUB socket unless its port is blocked by a firewall. Once connected, these arbitrary clients will receive all of the same data broadcasted to all of the secondary vLLM hosts. This data is internal vLLM state information that is not useful to an attacker. By potentially connecting to this socket many times and not reading data published to them, an attacker can also cause a denial of service by slowing down or potentially blocking the publisher.

CVE-2025-27409	2025-04-30T15:16:01.067	2025-05-16T16:29:40.663	Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. Prior to version 3.3.3, path traversal is possible in Joplin Server if static file path starts with `css/pluginAssets` or `js/pluginAssets`. The `findLocalFile` function in the `default route` calls `localFileFromUrl` to check for special `pluginAssets` paths. If the function returns a path, the result is returned directly, without checking for path traversal. The vulnerability allows attackers to read files outside the intended directories.

CVE-2025-32971	2025-04-30T15:16:01.540	2025-05-13T15:06:38.253	XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 4.5.1 to before 15.10.13, from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.4.4, and from 16.5.0-rc-1 to before 16.8.0-rc-1, the Solr script service doesn't take dropped programming rights into account. The Solr script service that is accessible in XWiki's scripting API normally requires programming rights to be called. Due to using the wrong API for checking rights, it doesn't take the fact into account that programming rights might have been dropped by calling `$xcontext.dropPermissions()`. If some code relies on this for the safety of executing Velocity code with the wrong author context, this could allow a user with script rights to either cause a high load by indexing documents or to temporarily remove documents from the search index. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.13, 16.4.4, and 16.8.0-rc-1.	3.8	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L

In versions starting from 6.1-milestone-1 to before 15.10.12, from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.4.3, and from 16.5.0-rc-1 to before 16.8.0-rc-1, the script API of the LESS compiler in XWiki is incorrectly checking for rights when calling the cache cleaning API, making it possible to clean the cache without having programming right. The only impact of this is a slowdown in XWiki execution as the caches are re-filled. As this vulnerability requires script right to exploit, and script right already allows unlimited execution of scripts, the additional impact due to this vulnerability is low. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.12, 16.4.3, and 16.8.0-rc-1.	2.7	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

An attacker who created such a malicious object could use this to gain programming rights on the wiki. For this, the attacker needs to have edit rights on at least one page to place this object and then get an admin user to edit that document. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.12, 16.4.3, and 16.8.0-rc-1.	9.0	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

In versions starting from 15.9-rc-1 to before 15.10.8 and from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.2.0, the required rights analysis doesn't consider TextAreas with default content type. When editing a page, XWiki warns since version 15.9 when there is content on the page like a script macro that would gain more rights due to the editing. This analysis doesn't consider certain kinds of properties, allowing a user to put malicious scripts in there that will be executed after a user with script, admin, or programming rights edited the page. Such a malicious script could impact the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.8 and 16.2.0.	9.0	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

Prior to versions 1.13.5 and 1.14.0, it may happen that policy rules using namespace selector(s) in their match statements are mistakenly not applied during admission review request processing due to a missing error propagation in function `GetNamespaceSelectorsFromNamespaceLister` in `pkg/utils/engine/labels.go`. As a consequence, security-critical mutations and validations are bypassed, potentially allowing attackers with K8s API access to perform malicious operations.

Prior to versions 1.11.2, 1.10.2, 1.9.1, 1.11.0-network-topology-preview.3, and 1.12.0-alpha.2, attacker compromise of either the Elastic service or the extender plugin can cause denial of service of the scheduler. This is a privilege escalation, because Volcano users may run their Elastic service and extender plugins in separate pods or nodes from the scheduler. In the Kubernetes security model, node isolation is a security boundary, and as such an attacker is able to cross that boundary in Volcano's case if they have compromised either the vulnerable services or the pod/node in which they are deployed. The scheduler will become unavailable to other users and workloads in the cluster. The scheduler will either crash with an unrecoverable OOM panic or freeze while consuming excessive amounts of memory.

So, if no authenticator extension was installed, it's not really possible to do anything for an attacker. Also, in most cases, if an SSO authenticator is installed and utilized (like OIDC or LDAP for example), the worst an attacker can do is break authentication by switching back to the standard authenticator (that's because it's impossible to login to a user which does not have a stored password, and that's usually what SSO authenticator produce).
