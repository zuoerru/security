CVE-2025-25062	2025-02-03T04:15:09.587	2025-05-06T18:15:38.007	An XSS issue was discovered in Backdrop CMS 1.28.x before 1.28.5 and 1.29.x before 1.29.3. It doesn't sufficiently isolate long text content when the CKEditor 5 rich text editor is used. This allows a potential attacker to craft specialized HTML and JavaScript that may be executed when an administrator attempts to edit a piece of content. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have the ability to create long text content (such as through the node or comment forms) and an administrator must edit (not view) the content that contains the malicious content. This problem only exists when using the CKEditor 5 module.	4.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N		
CVE-2025-25063	2025-02-03T04:15:09.760	2025-02-03T04:15:09.760	An XSS issue was discovered in Backdrop CMS 1.28.x before 1.28.5 and 1.29.x before 1.29.3. It does not sufficiently validate uploaded SVG images to ensure they do not contain potentially dangerous SVG tags. SVG images can contain clickable links and executable scripting, and using a crafted SVG, it is possible to execute scripting in the browser when an SVG image is viewed. This issue is mitigated by the attacker needing to be able to upload SVG images, and that Backdrop embeds all uploaded SVG images within &lt;img&gt; tags, which prevents scripting from executing. The SVG must be viewed directly by its URL in order to run any embedded scripting.	4.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

CVE-2025-24898	2025-02-03T18:15:43.077	2025-02-11T08:15:32.003	rust-openssl is a set of OpenSSL bindings for the Rust programming language. In affected versions `ssl::select_next_proto` can return a slice pointing into the `server` argument's buffer but with a lifetime bound to the `client` argument. In situations where the `sever` buffer's lifetime is shorter than the `client` buffer's, this can cause a use after free. This could cause the server to crash or to return arbitrary memory contents to the client. The crate`openssl` version 0.10.70 fixes the signature of `ssl::select_next_proto` to properly constrain the output buffer's lifetime to that of both input buffers. Users are advised to upgrade. In standard usage of `ssl::select_next_proto` in the callback passed to `SslContextBuilder::set_alpn_select_callback`, code is only affected if the `server` buffer is constructed *within* the callback.

An attacker with control over environment variable values can inject unintended environment variables into `process.env`. This can lead to arbitrary command execution or unexpected behavior in applications that rely on environment variables for security-sensitive operations. Applications that process untrusted input and pass it through `dotenv.stringify` are particularly vulnerable. This issue has been patched in version 8.3.2. Users should immediately upgrade to this version to mitigate the vulnerability. If upgrading is not feasible, users can mitigate the vulnerability by sanitizing user-controlled environment variable values before passing them to `dotenv.stringify`. Specifically, avoid using `""`, `'`, and backticks in values, or enforce strict validation of environment variables before usage."

CVE-2024-35177	2025-02-03T22:15:27.600	2025-09-16T17:18:46.207	Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. It is capable of protecting workloads across on-premises, virtualized, containerized, and cloud-based environments. The wazuh-agent for Windows is vulnerable to a Local Privilege Escalation vulnerability due to improper ACL of the non-default installation directory. A local malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability by placing one of the many DLL that are loaded and not present on the system in the installation folder of the agent OR by replacing the service executable binary itself with a malicious one. The root cause is an improper ACL applied on the installation folder when a non-default installation path is specified (e.g,: C:\wazuh). Many DLLs are loaded from the installation folder and by creating a malicious DLLs that exports the functions of a legit one (and that is not found on the system where the agent is installed, such as rsync.dll) it is possible to escalate privileges from a low-privileged user and obtain code execution under the context of NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. This issue has been addressed in version 4.9.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2025-24371	2025-02-03T22:15:28.460	2025-02-03T22:15:28.460	CometBFT is a distributed, Byzantine fault-tolerant, deterministic state machine replication engine. In the `blocksync` protocol peers send their `base` and `latest` heights when they connect to a new node (`A`), which is syncing to the tip of a network. `base` acts as a lower ground and informs `A` that the peer only has blocks starting from height `base`. `latest` height informs `A` about the latest block in a network. Normally, nodes would only report increasing heights. If `B` fails to provide the latest block, `B` is removed and the `latest` height (target height) is recalculated based on other nodes `latest` heights. The existing code however doesn't check for the case where `B` first reports `latest` height `X` and immediately after height `Y`, where `X > Y`. `A` will be trying to catch up to 2000 indefinitely. This condition requires the introduction of malicious code in the full node first reporting some non-existing `latest` height, then reporting lower `latest` height and nodes which are syncing using `blocksync` protocol. This issue has been patched in versions 1.0.1 and 0.38.17 and all users are advised to upgrade. Operators may attempt to ban malicious peers from the network as a workaround.

CVE-2023-52924	2025-02-05T10:15:21.073	2025-02-05T10:15:21.073	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: don't skip expired elements during walk

There is an asymmetry between commit/abort and preparation phase if the
following conditions are met:

1. set is a verdict map (""1.2.3.4 : jump foo"")
2. timeouts are enabled

In this case, following sequence is problematic:

1. element E in set S refers to chain C
2. userspace requests removal of set S
3. kernel does a set walk to decrement chain->use count for all elements
   from preparation phase
4. kernel does another set walk to remove elements from the commit phase
   (or another walk to do a chain->use increment for all elements from
    abort phase)

If E has already expired in 1), it will be ignored during list walk, so its use count
won't have been changed.

Then, when set is culled, ->destroy callback will zap the element via
nf_tables_set_elem_destroy(), but this function is only safe for
elements that have been deactivated earlier from the preparation phase:
lack of earlier deactivate removes the element but leaks the chain use
count, which results in a WARN splat when the chain gets removed later,
plus a leak of the nft_chain structure.

Update pipapo_get() not to skip expired elements, otherwise flush
command reports bogus ENOENT errors."					
CVE-2023-52925	2025-02-05T10:15:21.963	2025-02-06T16:15:37.110	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Expected: 0-2 . 0-3, got:
W: [FAILED]     ./testcases/sets/0044interval_overlap_0: got 1

Insertion must ignore duplicate but expired entries.

Moreover, there is a strange asymmetry in nft_pipapo_activate:

It refetches the current element, whereas the other ->activate callbacks
(bitmap, hash, rhash, rbtree) use elem->priv.
Same for .remove: other set implementations take elem->priv,
nft_pipapo_remove fetches elem->priv, then does a relookup,
remove this.

I suspect this was the reason for the change that prompted the
removal of the expired check in pipapo_get() in the first place,
but skipping exired elements there makes no sense to me, this helper
is used for normal get requests, insertions (duplicate check)
and deactivate callback.

In first two cases expired elements must be skipped.

For ->deactivate(), this gets called for DELSETELEM, so it
seems to me that expired elements should be skipped as well, i.e.
delete request should fail with -ENOENT error."	6.2	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Using a specially crafted file, a user could potentially upload a file containing code that when executed could send arbitrary requests to the server. If that file was opened by an administrator, it could lead to escalation of privileges of the original submitter or other malicious actions. Users must have been registered to the site to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability has been fixed in CKAN 2.10.7 and 2.11.2. Users are advised to upgrade. On versions prior to CKAN 2.10.7 and 2.11.2, site maintainers can restrict the file types supported for uploading using the `ckan.upload.user.mimetypes` / `ckan.upload.user.types` and `ckan.upload.group.mimetypes` / `ckan.upload.group.types` config options.

CVE-2025-24803	2025-02-05T19:15:46.207	2025-07-07T13:41:11.010	Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is an automated, all-in-one mobile application (Android/iOS/Windows) pen-testing, malware analysis and security assessment framework. According to Apple's documentation for bundle ID's, it must contain only alphanumeric characters (A–Z, a–z, and 0–9), hyphens (-), and periods (.). However, an attacker can manually modify this value in the `Info.plist` file and add special characters to the `<key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>` value. The `dynamic_analysis.html` file does not sanitize the received bundle value from Corellium and as a result, it is possible to break the HTML context and achieve Stored XSS. This issue has been addressed in version 4.3.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	5.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

CVE-2025-24981	2025-02-06T18:15:32.847	2025-02-06T18:15:32.847	MDC is a tool to take regular Markdown and write documents interacting deeply with a Vue component. In affected versions unsafe parsing logic of the URL from markdown can lead to arbitrary JavaScript code due to a bypass to the existing guards around the `javascript:` protocol scheme in the URL. The parsing logic implement in `props.ts` maintains a deny-list approach to filtering potential malicious payload. It does so by matching protocol schemes like `javascript:` and others. These security guards can be bypassed by an adversarial that provides JavaScript URLs with HTML entities encoded via hex string. Users who consume this library and perform markdown parsing from unvalidated sources could result in rendering vulnerable XSS anchor links. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 0.13.3 and all users are advised to upgrade.

While the application only displays Sqlite3 databases present in the directory `/db`, there is no path traversal prevention in place. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to open any Sqlite3 database present on the host machine that the application is running on. Affected versions of WhoDB allow users to connect to Sqlite3 databases. By default, the databases must be present in `/db/` (or alternatively `./tmp/` if development mode is enabled).  If no databases are present in the default directory, the UI indicates that the user is unable to open any databases. The database file is an user-controlled value. This value is used in `.Join()` with the default directory, in order to get the full path of the database file to open. No checks are performed whether the database file that is eventually opened actually resides in the default directory `/db`. This allows an attacker to use path traversal (`../../`) in order to open any Sqlite3 database present on the system. This issue has been addressed in version 0.45.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	10.0	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2025-24787	2025-02-06T19:15:20.213	2025-02-06T20:15:40.840	WhoDB is an open source database management tool. In affected versions the application is vulnerable to parameter injection in database connection strings, which allows an attacker to read local files on the machine the application is running on. The application uses string concatenation to build database connection URIs which are then passed to corresponding libraries responsible for setting up the database connections. This string concatenation is done unsafely and without escaping or encoding the user input. This allows an user, in many cases, to inject arbitrary parameters into the URI string. These parameters can be potentially dangerous depending on the libraries used. One of these dangerous parameters is `allowAllFiles` in the library `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql`. Should this be set to `true`, the library enables running the `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` query on any file on the host machine (in this case, the machine that WhoDB is running on). By injecting `&allowAllFiles=true` into the connection URI and connecting to any MySQL server (such as an attacker-controlled one), the attacker is able to read local files. This issue has been addressed in version 0.45.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	8.6	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

Prefix caching makes use of Python's built-in hash() function. As of Python 3.12, the behavior of hash(None) has changed to be a predictable constant value. This makes it more feasible that someone could try exploit hash collisions. The impact of a collision would be using cache that was generated using different content. Given knowledge of prompts in use and predictable hashing behavior, someone could intentionally populate the cache using a prompt known to collide with another prompt in use.

CVE-2025-24028	2025-02-07T23:15:15.013	2025-04-18T01:57:17.133	Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. This vulnerability is caused by differences between how Joplin's HTML sanitizer handles comments and how the browser handles comments. This affects both the Rich Text Editor and the Markdown viewer. However, unlike the Rich Text Editor, the Markdown viewer is `cross-origin isolated`, which prevents JavaScript from directly accessing functions/variables in the toplevel Joplin `window`. This issue is not present in Joplin 3.1.24 and may have been introduced in `9b50539`. This is an XSS vulnerability that impacts users that open untrusted notes in the Rich Text Editor.

This vulnerability is caused by adding note titles to the document using React's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, without first escaping HTML entities. Joplin lacks a Content-Security-Policy with a restrictive `script-src`. This allows arbitrary JavaScript execution via inline `onclick`/`onload` event handlers in unsanitized HTML. Additionally, Joplin's main window is created with `nodeIntegration` set to `true`, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution to result in arbitrary code execution. Anyone who 1) receives notes from unknown sources and 2) uses <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>p</kbd> to search is impacted. This issue has been addressed in version 3.1.24 and all users are advised to upgrade.

platform/x86: lenovo-yoga-tab2-pro-1380-fastcharger: fix serdev race

The yt2_1380_fc_serdev_probe() function calls devm_serdev_device_open()
before setting the client ops via serdev_device_set_client_ops(). This
ordering can trigger a NULL pointer dereference in the serdev controller's
receive_buf handler, as it assumes serdev->ops is valid when
SERPORT_ACTIVE is set.

This is similar to the issue fixed in commit 5e700b384ec1
(""platform/chrome: cros_ec_uart: properly fix race condition"") where
devm_serdev_device_open() was called before fully initializing the
device.

Fix the race by ensuring client ops are set before enabling the port via
devm_serdev_device_open().

drm/v3d: Assign job pointer to NULL before signaling the fence

In commit e4b5ccd392b9 (""drm/v3d: Ensure job pointer is set to NULL
after job completion""), we introduced a change to assign the job pointer
to NULL after completing a job, indicating job completion.

However, this approach created a race condition between the DRM
scheduler workqueue and the IRQ execution thread. As soon as the fence is
signaled in the IRQ execution thread, a new job starts to be executed.
This results in a race condition where the IRQ execution thread sets the
job pointer to NULL simultaneously as the `run_job()` function assigns
a new job to the pointer.

This race condition can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the IRQ
execution thread sets the job pointer to NULL after `run_job()` assigns
it to the new job. When the new job completes and the GPU emits an
interrupt, `v3d_irq()` is triggered, potentially causing a crash.

USB: serial: quatech2: fix null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb()

This patch addresses a null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb() due to
an incorrect bounds check in the following:

       if (newport > serial->num_ports) {
               dev_err(&port->dev,
                       ""%s - port change to invalid port: %i\n"",

The condition doesn't account for the valid range of the serial->port
buffer, which is from 0 to serial->num_ports - 1. When newport is equal
to serial->num_ports, the assignment of ""port"" in the
following code is out-of-bounds and NULL:

       serial_priv->current_port = newport;
       port = serial->port[serial_priv->current_port];

CVE-2025-21693	2025-02-10T16:15:38.883	2025-04-16T19:15:52.933	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: zswap: properly synchronize freeing resources during CPU hotunplug

In zswap_compress() and zswap_decompress(), the per-CPU acomp_ctx of the
current CPU at the beginning of the operation is retrieved and used
throughout.  However, since neither preemption nor migration are disabled,
it is possible that the operation continues on a different CPU.

If the original CPU is hotunplugged while the acomp_ctx is still in use,
we run into a UAF bug as some of the resources attached to the acomp_ctx
are freed during hotunplug in zswap_cpu_comp_dead() (i.e. 
acomp_ctx.buffer, acomp_ctx.req, or acomp_ctx.acomp).

The problem was introduced in commit 1ec3b5fe6eec (""mm/zswap: move to use
crypto_acomp API for hardware acceleration"") when the switch to the
crypto_acomp API was made.  Prior to that, the per-CPU crypto_comp was
retrieved using get_cpu_ptr() which disables preemption and makes sure the
CPU cannot go away from under us.  Preemption cannot be disabled with the
crypto_acomp API as a sleepable context is needed.

Use the acomp_ctx.mutex to synchronize CPU hotplug callbacks allocating
and freeing resources with compression/decompression paths.  Make sure
that acomp_ctx.req is NULL when the resources are freed.  In the
compression/decompression paths, check if acomp_ctx.req is NULL after
acquiring the mutex (meaning the CPU was offlined) and retry on the new
CPU.

The initialization of acomp_ctx.mutex is moved from the CPU hotplug
callback to the pool initialization where it belongs (where the mutex is
allocated).  In addition to adding clarity, this makes sure that CPU
hotplug cannot reinitialize a mutex that is already locked by
compression/decompression.

Previously a fix was attempted by holding cpus_read_lock() [1].  This
would have caused a potential deadlock as it is possible for code already
holding the lock to fall into reclaim and enter zswap (causing a
deadlock).  A fix was also attempted using SRCU for synchronization, but
Johannes pointed out that synchronize_srcu() cannot be used in CPU hotplug
notifiers [2].

Alternative fixes that were considered/attempted and could have worked:
- Refcounting the per-CPU acomp_ctx. This involves complexity in
  handling the race between the refcount dropping to zero in
  zswap_[de]compress() and the refcount being re-initialized when the
  CPU is onlined.
- Disabling migration before getting the per-CPU acomp_ctx [3], but
  that's discouraged and is a much bigger hammer than needed, and could
  result in subtle performance issues.

CVE-2025-24031	2025-02-10T16:15:38.990	2025-02-10T16:15:38.990	PAM-PKCS#11 is a Linux-PAM login module that allows a X.509 certificate based user login. In versions 0.6.12 and prior, the pam_pkcs11 module segfaults when a user presses ctrl-c/ctrl-d when they are asked for a PIN. When a user enters no PIN at all, `pam_get_pwd` will never initialize the password buffer pointer and as such `cleanse` will try to dereference an uninitialized pointer. On my system this pointer happens to have the value 3 most of the time when running sudo and as such it will segfault. The most likely impact to a system affected by this issue is an availability impact due to a daemon that uses PAM crashing. As of time of publication, a patch for the issue is unavailable.

Prior to version 0.6.13, if cert_policy is set to none (the default value), then pam_pkcs11 will only check if the user is capable of logging into the token. An attacker may create a different token with the user's public data (e.g. the user's certificate) and a PIN known to the attacker. If no signature with the private key is required, then the attacker may now login as user with that created token. The default to *not* check the private key's signature has been changed with commit commi6638576892b59a99389043c90a1e7dd4d783b921, so that all versions starting with pam_pkcs11-0.6.0 should be affected. As a workaround, in `pam_pkcs11.conf`, set at least `cert_policy = signature;`.

CVE-2025-25188	2025-02-10T18:15:35.827	2025-02-10T18:15:35.827	Hickory DNS is a Rust based DNS client, server, and resolver. A vulnerability present starting in version 0.8.0 and prior to versions 0.24.3 and 0.25.0-alpha.5 impacts Hickory DNS users relying on DNSSEC verification in the client library, stub resolver, or recursive resolver. The DNSSEC validation routines treat entire RRsets of DNSKEY records as trusted once they have established trust in only one of the DNSKEYs. As a result, if a zone includes a DNSKEY with a public key that matches a configured trust anchor, all keys in that zone will be trusted to authenticate other records in the zone. There is a second variant of this vulnerability involving DS records, where an authenticated DS record covering one DNSKEY leads to trust in signatures made by an unrelated DNSKEY in the same zone. Versions 0.24.3 and 0.25.0-alpha.5 fix the issue.

The ZOO-Project Web Processing Service (WPS) Server contains a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in its EchoProcess service prior to commit 7a5ae1a. The vulnerability exists because the EchoProcess service directly reflects user input in its output without proper sanitization when handling complex inputs.The service accepts various input formats including XML, JSON, and SVG, and returns the content based on the requested MIME type. When processing SVG content and returning it with the image/svg+xml MIME type, the server fails to sanitize potentially malicious JavaScript in attributes like onload, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser context. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous because it exists in a service specifically designed to echo back user input, and the lack of proper sanitization in combination with SVG handling creates a reliable XSS vector.

CVE-2024-12797	2025-02-11T16:15:38.827	2025-02-18T14:15:27.107	"Issue summary: Clients using RFC7250 Raw Public Keys (RPKs) to authenticate a
server may fail to notice that the server was not authenticated, because
handshakes don't abort as expected when the SSL_VERIFY_PEER verification mode
is set.

Impact summary: TLS and DTLS connections using raw public keys may be
vulnerable to man-in-middle attacks when server authentication failure is not
detected by clients.

RPKs are disabled by default in both TLS clients and TLS servers.  The issue
only arises when TLS clients explicitly enable RPK use by the server, and the
server, likewise, enables sending of an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate
chain.  The affected clients are those that then rely on the handshake to
fail when the server's RPK fails to match one of the expected public keys,
by setting the verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_PEER.

Clients that enable server-side raw public keys can still find out that raw
public key verification failed by calling SSL_get_verify_result(), and those
that do, and take appropriate action, are not affected.  This issue was
introduced in the initial implementation of RPK support in OpenSSL 3.2.

The FIPS modules in 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue."	6.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

Starting in version 12.109.0 and prior to version 2025.2.0-alpha.0, due to a lack of CSRF protection and the lack of proper security attributes in the authentication cookies of Bull's dashboard, some of the APIs of bull-board may be subject to CSRF attacks. There is a risk of this vulnerability being used for attacks with relatively large impact on availability and integrity, such as the ability to add arbitrary jobs. This vulnerability was fixed in 2025.2.0-alpha.0. As a workaround, block all access to the `/queue` directory with a web application firewall (WAF).	8.2	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:L		
CVE-2025-24900	2025-02-11T16:15:51.763	2025-02-11T16:15:51.763	"Concorde, formerly know as Nexkey, is a fork of the federated microblogging platform Misskey. Due to a lack of CSRF countermeasures and improper settings of cookies for MediaProxy authentication, there is a vulnerability that allows MediaProxy authentication to be bypassed. In versions prior to 12.25Q1.1, the authentication cookie does not have the SameSite attribute. This allows an attacker to bypass MediaProxy authentication and load any image without restrictions under certain circumstances. In versions prior to 12.24Q2.3, this cookie was also used to authenticate the job queue management page (bull-board), so bull-board authentication is also bypassed. This may enable attacks that have a significant impact on availability and integrity.
The affected versions are too old to be covered by this advisory, but the maintainers of Concorde strongly recommend not using older versions. Version 12.25Q1.1 contains a patch. There is no effective workaround other than updating."	8.6	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2025-24973	2025-02-11T16:15:52.020	2025-02-11T16:15:52.020	Concorde, formerly know as Nexkey, is a fork of the federated microblogging platform Misskey. Prior to version 12.25Q1.1, due to an improper implementation of the logout process, authentication credentials remain in cookies even after a user has explicitly logged out, which may allow an attacker to steal authentication tokens. This could have devastating consequences if a user with admin privileges is (or was) using a shared device. Users who have logged in on a shared device should go to Settings > Security and regenerate their login tokens. Version 12.25Q1.1 fixes the issue. As a workaround, clear cookies and site data in the browser after logging out.	9.3	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2025-24976	2025-02-11T16:15:52.163	2025-02-11T16:15:52.163	Distribution is a toolkit to pack, ship, store, and deliver container content. Systems running registry versions 3.0.0-beta.1 through 3.0.0-rc.2 with token authentication enabled may be vulnerable to an issue in which token authentication allows an attacker to inject an untrusted signing key in a JSON web token (JWT). The issue lies in how the JSON web key (JWK) verification is performed. When a JWT contains a JWK header without a certificate chain, the code only checks if the KeyID (`kid`) matches one of the trusted keys, but doesn't verify that the actual key material matches. A fix for the issue is available at commit 5ea9aa028db65ca5665f6af2c20ecf9dc34e5fcd and expected to be a part of version 3.0.0-rc.3. There is no way to work around this issue without patching if the system requires token authentication.

CVE-2025-25202	2025-02-11T19:15:18.690	2025-08-27T13:23:48.317	Ash Authentication is an authentication framework for Elixir applications. Applications which have been bootstrapped by the igniter installer present since AshAuthentication v4.1.0 and who have used the magic link strategy _or_ are manually revoking tokens are affected by revoked tokens being allowed to verify as valid. Unless one hase implemented any kind of custom token revocation feature in your application, then one will not be affected. The impact here for users using builtin functionality is that magic link tokens are reusable until they expire. With that said, magic link tokens are only valid for 10 minutes, so the surface area for abuse is extremely low here. The flaw is patched in version 4.4.9. Additionally a compile time warning is shown to users with remediation instructions if they upgrade. 4.4.9 ships with an upgrader, so those who use `mix igniter.upgrade ash_authentication` will have the necessary patch applied. Otherwise, one may run the upgrader manually as described in the error message. As a workaround, delete the generated `:revoked?` generic action in the token resource. This will cause it to use the one internal to Ash Authentication which has always been correct. Alternatively, manually make the changes that are included in the patch.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

hrtimers: Handle CPU state correctly on hotplug

Consider a scenario where a CPU transitions from CPUHP_ONLINE to halfway
through a CPU hotunplug down to CPUHP_HRTIMERS_PREPARE, and then back to
CPUHP_ONLINE:

Since hrtimers_prepare_cpu() does not run, cpu_base.hres_active remains set
to 1 throughout. However, during a CPU unplug operation, the tick and the
clockevents are shut down at CPUHP_AP_TICK_DYING. On return to the online
state, for instance CFS incorrectly assumes that the hrtick is already
active, and the chance of the clockevent device to transition to oneshot
mode is also lost forever for the CPU, unless it goes back to a lower state
than CPUHP_HRTIMERS_PREPARE once.

This round-trip reveals another issue; cpu_base.online is not set to 1
after the transition, which appears as a WARN_ON_ONCE in enqueue_hrtimer().

Aside of that, the bulk of the per CPU state is not reset either, which
means there are dangling pointers in the worst case.

Address this by adding a corresponding startup() callback, which resets the
stale per CPU state and sets the online flag.

[ tglx: Make the new callback unconditionally available, remove the online
  	modification in the prepare() callback and clear the remaining
  	state in the starting callback instead of the prepare callback ]"	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2024-57952	2025-02-12T14:15:31.540	2025-10-01T20:18:07.677	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Revert ""libfs: fix infinite directory reads for offset dir""

The current directory offset allocator (based on mtree_alloc_cyclic)
stores the next offset value to return in octx->next_offset. This
mechanism typically returns values that increase monotonically over
time. Eventually, though, the newly allocated offset value wraps
back to a low number (say, 2) which is smaller than other already-
allocated offset values.

Yu Kuai <yukuai3@huawei.com> reports that, after commit 64a7ce76fb90
(""libfs: fix infinite directory reads for offset dir""), if a
directory's offset allocator wraps, existing entries are no longer
visible via readdir/getdents because offset_readdir() stops listing
entries once an entry's offset is larger than octx->next_offset.
These entries vanish persistently -- they can be looked up, but will
never again appear in readdir(3) output.

The reason for this is that the commit treats directory offsets as
monotonically increasing integer values rather than opaque cookies,
and introduces this comparison:

	if (dentry2offset(dentry) >= last_index) {

On 64-bit platforms, the directory offset value upper bound is
2^63 - 1. Directory offsets will monotonically increase for millions
of years without wrapping.

On 32-bit platforms, however, LONG_MAX is 2^31 - 1. The allocator
can wrap after only a few weeks (at worst).

Revert commit 64a7ce76fb90 (""libfs: fix infinite directory reads for
offset dir"") to prepare for a fix that can work properly on 32-bit
systems and might apply to recent LTS kernels where shmem employs
the simple_offset mechanism."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2025-25184	2025-02-12T17:15:24.000	2025-10-10T16:39:39.660	Rack provides an interface for developing web applications in Ruby. Prior to versions 2.2.11, 3.0.12, and 3.1.10, Rack::CommonLogger can be exploited by crafting input that includes newline characters to manipulate log entries. The supplied proof-of-concept demonstrates injecting malicious content into logs. When a user provides the authorization credentials via Rack::Auth::Basic, if success, the username will be put in env['REMOTE_USER'] and later be used by Rack::CommonLogger for logging purposes. The issue occurs when a server intentionally or unintentionally allows a user creation with the username contain CRLF and white space characters, or the server just want to log every login attempts. If an attacker enters a username with CRLF character, the logger will log the malicious username with CRLF characters into the logfile. Attackers can break log formats or insert fraudulent entries, potentially obscuring real activity or injecting malicious data into log files. Versions 2.2.11, 3.0.12, and 3.1.10 contain a fix.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

Prior to Crayfish version 4.1.0, remote code execution may be possible in web-accessible installations of Homarus in certain configurations. The issue has been patched in `islandora/crayfish:4.1.0`. Some workarounds are available. The exploit requires making a request against the Homarus's `/convert` endpoint; therefore, the ability to exploit is much reduced if the microservice is not directly accessible from the Internet, so: Prevent general access from the Internet from hitting Homarus. Alternatively or additionally, configure auth in Crayfish to be more strongly required, such that requests with `Authorization` headers that do not validate are rejected before the problematic CLI interpolation occurs.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

net: sched: Disallow replacing of child qdisc from one parent to another

Lion Ackermann was able to create a UAF which can be abused for privilege
escalation with the following script

Step 1. create root qdisc
tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1:0 drr

step2. a class for packet aggregation do demonstrate uaf
tc class add dev lo classid 1:1 drr

step3. a class for nesting
tc class add dev lo classid 1:2 drr

step4. a class to graft qdisc to
tc class add dev lo classid 1:3 drr

step5.
tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:1 handle 2:0 plug limit 1024

step6.
tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:2 handle 3:0 drr

step7.
tc class add dev lo classid 3:1 drr

step 8.
tc qdisc add dev lo parent 3:1 handle 4:0 pfifo

step 9. Display the class/qdisc layout

tc class ls dev lo
 class drr 1:1 root leaf 2: quantum 64Kb
 class drr 1:2 root leaf 3: quantum 64Kb
 class drr 3:1 root leaf 4: quantum 64Kb

tc qdisc ls
 qdisc drr 1: dev lo root refcnt 2
 qdisc plug 2: dev lo parent 1:1
 qdisc pfifo 4: dev lo parent 3:1 limit 1000p
 qdisc drr 3: dev lo parent 1:2

step10. trigger the bug <=== prevented by this patch
tc qdisc replace dev lo parent 1:3 handle 4:0

step 11. Redisplay again the qdiscs/classes

tc class ls dev lo
 class drr 1:1 root leaf 2: quantum 64Kb
 class drr 1:2 root leaf 3: quantum 64Kb
 class drr 1:3 root leaf 4: quantum 64Kb
 class drr 3:1 root leaf 4: quantum 64Kb

tc qdisc ls
 qdisc drr 1: dev lo root refcnt 2
 qdisc plug 2: dev lo parent 1:1
 qdisc pfifo 4: dev lo parent 3:1 refcnt 2 limit 1000p
 qdisc drr 3: dev lo parent 1:2

Observe that a) parent for 4:0 does not change despite the replace request.
There can only be one parent.  b) refcount has gone up by two for 4:0 and
c) both class 1:3 and 3:1 are pointing to it.

Step 12.  send one packet to plug
echo """" | socat -u STDIN UDP4-DATAGRAM:127.0.0.1:8888,priority=$((0x10001))
step13.  send one packet to the grafted fifo
echo """" | socat -u STDIN UDP4-DATAGRAM:127.0.0.1:8888,priority=$((0x10003))

step14. lets trigger the uaf
tc class delete dev lo classid 1:3
tc class delete dev lo classid 1:1

The semantics of ""replace"" is for a del/add _on the same node_ and not
a delete from one node(3:1) and add to another node (1:3) as in step10.
While we could ""fix"" with a more complex approach there could be
consequences to expectations so the patch takes the preventive approach of
""disallow such config"".

This is because unregister_netdevice_many_notify might run before the
rtnl lock section of ethnl operations, eg. set_channels in the above
example. In this example the rss lock would be destroyed by the device
unregistration path before being used again, but in general running
ethnl operations while dismantle has started is not a good idea.

Fix this by denying any operation on devices being unregistered. A check
was already there in ethnl_ops_begin, but not wide enough.

Note that the same issue cannot be seen on the ioctl version
(__dev_ethtool) because the device reference is retrieved from within

Prior to version 0.14.1, a malicious SecureDrop Server could obtain code execution on the SecureDrop Client virtual machine (`sd-app`). SecureDrop Server itself has multiple layers of built-in hardening, and is a dedicated physical machine exposed on the internet only via Tor hidden services for the Source and Journalist interfaces, and optionally via remote SSH access over another Tor hidden service. A newsroom's SecureDrop Workstation communicates only with its own dedicated SecureDrop Server.

The SecureDrop Client runs in a dedicated Qubes virtual machine, named `sd-app`, as part of the SecureDrop Workstation. The private OpenPGP key used to decrypt submissions and replies is stored in a separate virtual machine and never accessed directly. The vulnerability lies in the code responsible for downloading replies. The filename of the reply is obtained from the `Content-Disposition` HTTP header and used to write the encrypted reply on disk. Note that filenames are generated and sanitized server-side, and files are downloaded in an encrypted format, so a remote attacker who has not achieved server compromise, such as one posing as a source, could not craft the HTTP response necessary for this attack.

While the filename is later checked to guard against path traversal before being moved into the Client’s data storage directory, the file has already been written to a potentially arbitrary location. In this case, `safe_move()` would detect the path traversal and fail, leaving the original downloaded file in the attacker-chosen directory. Code execution can be gained by writing an autostart file in `/home/user/.config/autostart/`.

Version 0.14.1 fixes the issue. As of time of publication, there is no known evidence of exploitation in the wild. This attack requires a previously compromised SecureDrop Server."	8.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2025-24889	2025-02-13T18:18:23.240	2025-02-13T18:18:23.240	The SecureDrop Client is a desktop application for journalists to communicate with sources and work with submissions on the SecureDrop Workstation. Prior to versions 0.14.1 and 1.0.1, an attacker who has already gained code execution in a virtual machine on the SecureDrop Workstation could gain code execution in the `sd-log` virtual machine by sending a specially crafted log entry. The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely and requires an attacker to already have code execution on one of the other virtual machines (VMs) of the system. Due to the Workstation's underlying usage of Qubes for strong isolation, the vulnerability would have allowed lateral movement between any log-enabled VM and the `sd-log` VM, but no further. The SecureDrop workstation collects logs centrally in an isolated virtual machine named `sd-log` for easy export for support and debugging purposes. The `sd-log`  VM is completely isolated from the internet and ingests logs via a narrow Qubes RPC policy that allows for specific inter-VM communication via the Xen vchan protocol used by Qubes's qrexec mechanism. A path traversal bug was found in the logic used to choose where to write the log file for a specific VM: the VM name, used unsanitized in the destination path in `sd-log`, is supplied by the logging VM itself instead of being read from a trusted source, such as the Qubes environment variable `QREXEC_REMOTE_DOMAIN` that is used in the fixed implementation. An attacker could provide an arbitrary source VM name, possibly overwriting logs of other VMs, or writing a file named `syslog.log`, with attacker-controlled content, in arbitrary directories as a low-privileged user. A successful attack could potentially overwrite or add configuration to software that loads configuration files from a directory. This is exploitable to achieve code execution by setting the target directory to `/home/user/.config/autostart/` and letting it write `syslog.log`, because XFCE treats any file in that directory as a `.desktop` file regardless of its extension. Versions 0.14.1 and 1.0.1 contain a patch for this issue.	4.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

CVE-2025-25295	2025-02-14T17:15:20.230	2025-02-14T17:15:20.230	Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. A path traversal vulnerability in Label Studio SDK versions prior to 1.0.10 allows unauthorized file access outside the intended directory structure. The flaw exists in the VOC, COCO and YOLO export functionalities. These functions invoke a `download` function on the `label-studio-sdk` python package, which fails to validate file paths when processing image references during task exports. By creating tasks with path traversal sequences in the image field, an attacker can force the application to read files from arbitrary server filesystem locations when exporting projects in any of the mentioned formats. This is authentication-required vulnerability allowing arbitrary file reads from the server filesystem. It may lead to potential exposure of sensitive information like configuration files, credentials, and confidential data. Label Studio versions before 1.16.0 specified SDK versions prior to 1.0.10 as dependencies, and the issue was confirmed in Label Studio version 1.13.2.dev0; therefore, Label Studio users should upgrade to 1.16.0 or newer to mitigate it.

CVE-2025-25296	2025-02-14T20:15:36.103	2025-08-25T01:15:44.783	Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. Prior to version 1.16.0, Label Studio's `/projects/upload-example` endpoint allows injection of arbitrary HTML through a `GET` request with an appropriately crafted `label_config` query parameter. By crafting a specially formatted XML label config with inline task data containing malicious HTML/JavaScript, an attacker can achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). While the application has a Content Security Policy (CSP), it is only set in report-only mode, making it ineffective at preventing script execution. The vulnerability exists because the upload-example endpoint renders user-provided HTML content without proper sanitization on a GET request. This allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript in victims' browsers by getting them to visit a maliciously crafted URL. This is considered vulnerable because it enables attackers to execute JavaScript in victims' contexts, potentially allowing theft of sensitive data, session hijacking, or other malicious actions. Version 1.16.0 contains a patch for the issue.	6.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N		
CVE-2025-25297	2025-02-14T20:15:36.627	2025-08-25T01:17:33.247	Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. Prior to version 1.16.0, Label Studio's S3 storage integration feature contains a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in its endpoint configuration. When creating an S3 storage connection, the application allows users to specify a custom S3 endpoint URL via the s3_endpoint parameter. This endpoint URL is passed directly to the boto3 AWS SDK without proper validation or restrictions on the protocol or destination. The vulnerability allows an attacker to make the application send HTTP requests to arbitrary internal services by specifying them as the S3 endpoint. When the storage sync operation is triggered, the application attempts to make S3 API calls to the specified endpoint, effectively making HTTP requests to the target service and returning the response in error messages. This SSRF vulnerability enables attackers to bypass network segmentation and access internal services that should not be accessible from the external network. The vulnerability is particularly severe because error messages from failed requests contain the full response body, allowing data exfiltration from internal services. Version 1.16.0 contains a patch for the issue.	8.6	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2025-25304	2025-02-14T20:15:36.903	2025-02-14T20:15:36.903	Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. Prior to version 5.26.0 of vega and 5.4.2 of vega-selections, the `vlSelectionTuples` function can be used to call JavaScript functions, leading to cross-site scripting.`vlSelectionTuples` calls multiple functions that can be controlled by an attacker, including one call with an attacker-controlled argument. This can be used to call `Function()` with arbitrary JavaScript and the resulting function can be called with `vlSelectionTuples` or using a type coercion to call `toString` or `valueOf`.

CVE-2024-31144	2025-02-14T21:15:15.107	2025-04-26T20:15:31.833	"For a brief summary of Xapi terminology, see:

   https://xapi-project.github.io/xen-api/overview.html#object-model-overview 

Xapi contains functionality to backup and restore metadata about Virtual
Machines and Storage Repositories (SRs).

The metadata itself is stored in a Virtual Disk Image (VDI) inside an
SR.  This is used for two purposes; a general backup of metadata
(e.g. to recover from a host failure if the filer is still good), and
Portable SRs (e.g. using an external hard drive to move VMs to another
host).

Metadata is only restored as an explicit administrator action, but
occurs in cases where the host has no information about the SR, and must
locate the metadata VDI in order to retrieve the metadata.

The metadata VDI is located by searching (in UUID alphanumeric order)
each VDI, mounting it, and seeing if there is a suitable metadata file
present.  The first matching VDI is deemed to be the metadata VDI, and
is restored from.

In the general case, the content of VDIs are controlled by the VM owner,
and should not be trusted by the host administrator.

A malicious guest can manipulate its disk to appear to be a metadata
backup.

A guest cannot choose the UUIDs of its VDIs, but a guest with one disk
has a 50% chance of sorting ahead of the legitimate metadata backup.  A
guest with two disks has a 75% chance, etc."	3.8	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N

CVE-2025-21702	2025-02-18T15:15:18.530	2025-03-13T13:15:48.563	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pfifo_tail_enqueue: Drop new packet when sch->limit == 0

Expected behaviour:
In case we reach scheduler's limit, pfifo_tail_enqueue() will drop a
packet in scheduler's queue and decrease scheduler's qlen by one.
Then, pfifo_tail_enqueue() enqueue new packet and increase
scheduler's qlen by one. Finally, pfifo_tail_enqueue() return
`NET_XMIT_CN` status code.

Weird behaviour:
In case we set `sch->limit == 0` and trigger pfifo_tail_enqueue() on a
scheduler that has no packet, the 'drop a packet' step will do nothing.
This means the scheduler's qlen still has value equal 0.
Then, we continue to enqueue new packet and increase scheduler's qlen by
one. In summary, we can leverage pfifo_tail_enqueue() to increase qlen by
one and return `NET_XMIT_CN` status code.

The problem is:
Let's say we have two qdiscs: Qdisc_A and Qdisc_B.
 - Qdisc_A's type must have '->graft()' function to create parent/child relationship.
   Let's say Qdisc_A's type is `hfsc`. Enqueue packet to this qdisc will trigger `hfsc_enqueue`.
 - Qdisc_B's type is pfifo_head_drop. Enqueue packet to this qdisc will trigger `pfifo_tail_enqueue`.
 - Qdisc_B is configured to have `sch->limit == 0`.
 - Qdisc_A is configured to route the enqueued's packet to Qdisc_B.

Enqueue packet through Qdisc_A will lead to:
 - hfsc_enqueue(Qdisc_A) -> pfifo_tail_enqueue(Qdisc_B)
 - Qdisc_B->q.qlen += 1
 - pfifo_tail_enqueue() return `NET_XMIT_CN`
 - hfsc_enqueue() check for `NET_XMIT_SUCCESS` and see `NET_XMIT_CN` => hfsc_enqueue() don't increase qlen of Qdisc_A.

The whole process lead to a situation where Qdisc_A->q.qlen == 0 and Qdisc_B->q.qlen == 1.
Replace 'hfsc' with other type (for example: 'drr') still lead to the same problem.
This violate the design where parent's qlen should equal to the sum of its childrens'qlen.

Bug impact: This issue can be used for user->kernel privilege escalation when it is reachable."

Duende.AccessTokenManagement contains a race condition when requesting access tokens using the client credentials flow. Concurrent requests to obtain an access token using differing protocol parameters can return access tokens obtained with the wrong scope, resource indicator, or other protocol parameters. Such usage is somewhat atypical, and only a small percentage of users are likely to be affected. Duende.AccessTokenManagement can request access tokens using the client credentials flow in several ways. In basic usage, the client credentials flow is configured once and the parameters do not vary. In more advanced situations, requests with varying protocol parameters may be made by calling specific overloads of these methods: `HttpContext.GetClientAccessTokenAsync()` and `IClientCredentialsTokenManagementService.GetAccessTokenAsync()`. There are overloads of both of these methods that accept a `TokenRequestParameters` object that customizes token request parameters. However, concurrent requests with varying `TokenRequestParameters` will result in the same token for all concurrent calls. Most users can simply update the NuGet package to the latest version. Customizations of the `IClientCredentialsTokenCache` that derive from the default implementation (`DistributedClientCredentialsTokenCache`) will require a small code change, as its constructor was changed to add a dependency on the `ITokenRequestSynchronization` service. The synchronization service will need to be injected into the derived class and passed to the base constructor. The impact of this vulnerability depends on how Duende.AccessTokenManagement is used and on the security architecture of the solution. Most users will not be vulnerable to this issue. More advanced users may run into this issue by calling the methods specified above with customized token request parameters. The impact of obtaining an access token with different than intended protocol parameters will vary depending on application logic, security architecture, and the authorization policy of the resource servers.

Authentication using Spid and CIE is based on the SAML2 standard which provides two entities: Identity Provider (IDP): the system that authenticates users and provides identity information (SAML affirmation) to the Service Provider, in essence, is responsible for the management of the credentials and identity of users; Service Provider (SP): the system that provides a service to the user and relies on the Identity Provider to authenticate the user, receives SAML assertions from the IdP to grant access to resources. The validation logic of the signature is central as it ensures that you cannot create a SAML response with arbitrary assertions and then impersonate other users. There is no guarantee that the first signature refers to the root object, it follows that if an attacker injects an item signed as the first element, all other signatures will not be verified. The only requirement is to have an XML element legitimately signed by the IdP, a condition that is easily met using the IdP's public metadata. An attacker could create an arbitrary SAML response that would be accepted by SPs using vulnerable SDKs, allowing him to impersonate any Spid and/or CIE user.

CVE-2025-25284	2025-02-18T19:15:28.797	2025-02-18T19:15:28.797	The ZOO-Project is an open source processing platform, released under MIT/X11 Licence. A vulnerability in ZOO-Project's WPS (Web Processing Service) implementation allows unauthorized access to files outside the intended directory through path traversal. Specifically, the Gdal_Translate service, when processing VRT (Virtual Format) files, does not properly validate file paths referenced in the VRTRasterBand element, allowing attackers to read arbitrary files on the system. The vulnerability exists because the service doesn't properly sanitize the SourceFilename parameter in VRT files, allowing relative path traversal sequences (../). When combined with VRT's raw data handling capabilities, this allows reading arbitrary files as raw binary data and converting them to TIFF format, effectively exposing their contents. This vulnerability is particularly severe because it allows attackers to read sensitive system files, potentially exposing configuration data, credentials, or other confidential information stored on the server. An unauthenticated attacker can read arbitrary files from the system through path traversal, potentially accessing sensitive information such as configuration files, credentials, or other confidential data stored on the server. The vulnerability requires no authentication and can be exploited remotely through the WPS service. This issue has been addressed in commit `5f155a8` and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.					
CVE-2025-25305	2025-02-18T19:15:29.083	2025-02-18T19:15:29.083	Home Assistant Core is an open source home automation that puts local control and privacy first. Affected versions are subject to a potential man-in-the-middle attacks due to missing SSL certificate verification in the project codebase and used third-party libraries. In the past, `aiohttp-session`/`request` had the parameter `verify_ssl` to control SSL certificate verification. This was a boolean value. In `aiohttp` 3.0, this parameter was deprecated in favor of the `ssl` parameter. Only when `ssl` is set to `None` or provided with a correct configured SSL context the standard SSL certificate verification will happen. When migrating integrations in Home Assistant and libraries used by Home Assistant, in some cases the `verify_ssl` parameter value was just moved to the new `ssl` parameter. This resulted in these integrations and 3rd party libraries using `request.ssl = True`, which unintentionally turned off SSL certificate verification and opened up a man-in-the-middle attack vector. This issue has been addressed in version 2024.1.6 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	7.0	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L

CVE-2025-26603	2025-02-18T19:15:29.387	2025-08-18T18:23:32.980	Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi. Vim allows to redirect screen messages using the `:redir` ex command to register, variables and files. It also allows to show the contents of registers using the `:registers` or `:display` ex command. When redirecting the output of `:display` to a register, Vim will free the register content before storing the new content in the register. Now when redirecting the `:display` command to a register that is being displayed, Vim will free the content while shortly afterwards trying to access it, which leads to a use-after-free. Vim pre 9.1.1115 checks in the ex_display() function, that it does not try to redirect to a register while displaying this register at the same time. However this check is not complete, and so Vim does not check the `+` and `*` registers (which typically donate the X11/clipboard registers, and when a clipboard connection is not possible will fall back to use register 0 instead. In Patch 9.1.1115 Vim will therefore skip outputting to register zero when trying to redirect to the clipboard registers `*` or `+`. Users are advised to upgrade.

CVE-2025-26604	2025-02-18T20:15:33.003	2025-02-18T20:15:33.003	Discord-Bot-Framework-Kernel is a Discord bot framework built with interactions.py, featuring modular extension management and secure execution. Because of the nature of arbitrary user-submited code execution, this allows user to execute potentially malicious code to perform damage or extract sensitive information. By loading the module containing the following code and run the command, the bot token can be extracted. Then the attacker can load a blocking module to sabotage the bot (DDoS attack) and the token can be used to make the fake bot act as the real one. If the bot has very high privilege, the attacker basically has full control before the user kicks the bot. Any Discord user that hosts Discord-Bot-Framework-Kernel before commit f0d9e70841a0e3170b88c4f8d562018ccd8e8b14 is affected. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may attempt to limit their discord bot's access via configuration options.	8.3	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2025-26623	2025-02-18T20:15:33.153	2025-09-02T21:37:53.757	Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read, write, delete and modify Exif, IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata. A heap buffer overflow was found in Exiv2 versions v0.28.0 to v0.28.4. Versions prior to v0.28.0, such as v0.27.7, are **not** affected. Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The heap overflow is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain code execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `fixiso`. The bug is fixed in version v0.28.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2025-27089	2025-02-19T17:15:15.800	2025-02-27T20:31:27.267	"Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. In affected versions if there are two overlapping policies for the `update` action that allow access to different fields, instead of correctly checking access permissions against the item they apply for the user is allowed to update the superset of fields allowed by any of the policies. E.g. have one policy allowing update access to `field_a` if the `id == 1` and one policy allowing update access to `field_b` if the `id == 2`. The user with both these policies is allowed to update both `field_a` and `field_b` for the items with ids `1` and `2`. Before v11, if a user was allowed to update an item they were allowed to update the fields that the single permission, that applied to that item, listed. With overlapping permissions this isn't as clear cut anymore and the union of fields might not be the fields the user is allowed to update for that specific item. The solution that this PR introduces is to evaluate the permissions for each field that the user tries to update in the validateItemAccess DB query, instead of only verifying access to the item as a whole. This is done by, instead of returning the actual field value, returning a flag that indicates if the user has access to that field. This uses the same case/when mechanism that is used for stripping out non permitted field that is at the core of the permissions engine. As a result, for every item that the access is validated for, the expected result is an item that has either 1 or null for all the ""requested"" fields instead of any of the actual field values. These results are not useful for anything other than verifying the field level access permissions. The final check in validateItemAccess can either fail if the number of items does not match the number of items the access is checked for (ie. the user does not have access to the item at all) or if not all of the passed in fields have access permissions for any of the returned items. This is a vulnerability that allows update access to unintended fields, potentially impacting the password field for user accounts. This has been addressed in version 11.1.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."	5.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

CVE-2025-24806	2025-02-19T18:15:24.467	2025-02-19T18:15:24.467	Authelia is an open-source authentication and authorization server providing two-factor authentication and single sign-on (SSO) for applications via a web portal. If users are allowed to sign in via both username and email the regulation system treats these as separate login events. This leads to the regulation limitations being effectively doubled assuming an attacker using brute-force to find a user password. It's important to note that due to the effective operation of regulation where no user-facing sign of their regulation ban being visible either via timing or via API responses, it's effectively impossible to determine if a failure occurs due to a bad username password combination, or a effective ban blocking the attempt which heavily mitigates any form of brute-force. This occurs because the records and counting process for this system uses the method utilized for sign in rather than the effective username attribute. This has a minimal impact on account security, this impact is increased naturally in scenarios when there is no two-factor authentication required and weak passwords are used. This makes it a bit easier to brute-force a password. A patch for this issue has been applied to versions 4.38.19, and 4.39.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should 1. Not heavily modify the default settings in a way that ends up with shorter or less frequent regulation bans. The default settings effectively mitigate any potential for this issue to be exploited. and 2. Disable the ability for users to login via an email address.

CVE-2025-27092	2025-02-19T23:15:15.957	2025-02-27T20:28:50.730	GHOSTS is an open source user simulation framework for cyber experimentation, simulation, training, and exercise. A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in GHOSTS version 8.0.0.0 that allows an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory through the photo retrieval endpoint. The vulnerability exists in the /api/npcs/{id}/photo endpoint, which is designed to serve profile photos for NPCs (Non-Player Characters) but fails to properly validate and sanitize file paths. When an NPC is created with a specially crafted photoLink value containing path traversal sequences (../, ..\, etc.), the application processes these sequences without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to traverse directory structures and access files outside of the intended photo directory, potentially exposing sensitive system files. The vulnerability is particularly severe because it allows reading arbitrary files from the server's filesystem with the permissions of the web application process, which could include configuration files, credentials, or other sensitive data. This issue has been addressed in version 8.2.7.90 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

A vulnerability in the decoding functions of OpenH264 codec library could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to trigger a heap overflow. This vulnerability is due to a race condition between a Sequence Parameter Set (SPS) memory allocation and a subsequent non Instantaneous Decoder Refresh (non-IDR) Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) unit memory usage. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious bitstream and tricking a victim user into processing an arbitrary video containing the malicious bistream. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected crash in the victim's user decoding client and, possibly, perform arbitrary commands on the victim's host by abusing the heap overflow. This vulnerability affects OpenH264 2.5.0 and earlier releases. Both Scalable Video Coding (SVC) mode and Advanced Video Coding (AVC) mode are affected by this vulnerability. OpenH264 software releases 2.6.0 and later contained the fix for this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

In affected versions a Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability enables attackers to create malicious URLs that, when visited, inject scripts into the web application. This can lead to session hijacking or phishing attacks on a trusted domain, posing a moderate risk to all users. It's possible to inject html elements, including scripts through the folder-list template. The affected template allows users to interact with the URL path provided by the `Request.URL.Path` variable, which is then rendered directly into the HTML without proper sanitization or escaping. This can be abused by attackers who craft a malicious URL containing injected HTML or JavaScript. When users visit such a URL, the malicious script will be executed in the user's context.

CVE-2019-8900	2025-02-21T22:15:10.393	2025-07-29T18:01:59.703	A vulnerability in the SecureROM of some Apple devices can be exploited by an unauthenticated local attacker to execute arbitrary code upon booting those devices. This vulnerability allows arbitrary code to be executed on the device. Exploiting the vulnerability requires physical access to the device: the device must be plugged in to a computer upon booting, and it must be put into Device Firmware Update (DFU) mode. The exploit is not persistent; rebooting the device overrides any changes to the device's software that were made during an exploited session on the device. Additionally, unless an attacker has access to the device's unlock PIN or fingerprint, an attacker cannot gain access to information protected by Apple's Secure Enclave or Touch ID features.	6.8	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Vyper `sqrt()` builtin uses the babylonian method to calculate square roots of decimals. Unfortunately, improper handling of the oscillating final states may lead to sqrt incorrectly returning rounded up results. This issue is being addressed and a fix is expected in version 0.4.1. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as the patched release is available. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2025-27104	2025-02-21T22:15:13.773	2025-03-28T20:05:35.357	vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the EVM. Multiple evaluation of a single expression is possible in the iterator target of a for loop. While the iterator expression cannot produce multiple writes, it can consume side effects produced in the loop body (e.g. read a storage variable updated in the loop body) and thus lead to unexpected program behavior. Specifically, reads in iterators which contain an ifexp (e.g. `for s: uint256 in ([read(), read()] if True else [])`) may interleave reads with writes in the loop body. Vyper for loops allow two kinds of iterator targets, namely the `range()` builtin and an iterable type, like SArray and DArray. During codegen, iterable lists are required to not produce any side-effects (in the following code, `range_scope` forces `iter_list` to be parsed in a constant context, which is checked against `is_constant`). However, this does not prevent the iterator from consuming side effects provided by the body of the loop. For SArrays on the other hand, `iter_list` is instantiated in the body of a `repeat` ir, so it can be evaluated several times. This issue is being addressed and is expected to be available in version 0.4.1. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as the patched release is available. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Vyper handles AugAssign statements by first caching the target location to avoid double evaluation. However, in the case when target is an access to a DynArray and the rhs modifies the array, the cached target will evaluate first, and the bounds check will not be re-evaluated during the write portion of the statement. This issue has been addressed in version 0.4.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H

In affected versions the use of javascript's `.replace()` opens up to potential Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities with the special replacement patterns beginning with `$`. Particularly, when the attributes of `Meta` tag from solid-meta are user-defined, attackers can utilise the special replacement patterns, either `$'` or `$\`` to achieve XSS. The solid-meta package has this issue since it uses `useAffect` and context providers, which injects the used assets in the html header. ""dom-expressions"" uses `.replace()` to insert the assets, which is vulnerable to the special replacement patterns listed above.  This effectively means that if the attributes of an asset tag contained user-controlled data, it would be vulnerable to XSS. For instance, there might be meta tags for the open graph protocol in a user profile page, but if attackers set the user query to some payload abusing `.replace()`, then they could execute arbitrary javascript in the victim's web browser. Moreover, it could be stored and cause more problems. This issue has been addressed in version 0.39.5 and all users are advised to upgrade.

usb: cdc-acm: Check control transfer buffer size before access

If the first fragment is shorter than struct usb_cdc_notification, we can't
calculate an expected_size. Log an error and discard the notification
instead of reading lengths from memory outside the received data, which can
lead to memory corruption when the expected_size decreases between
fragments, causing `expected_size - acm->nb_index` to wrap.

This issue has been present since the beginning of git history; however,
it only leads to memory corruption since commit ea2583529cd1
(""cdc-acm: reassemble fragmented notifications"").

A mitigating factor is that acm_ctrl_irq() can only execute after userspace
has opened /dev/ttyACM*; but if ModemManager is running, ModemManager will
do that automatically depending on the USB device's vendor/product IDs and
its other interfaces."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Dependency-Track allows users with the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission to customize notification templates. Templates are evaluated using the Pebble template engine. Pebble supports an `include` tag, which allows template authors to include the content of arbitrary files upon evaluation. Prior to version 4.12.6, users of Dependency-Track with the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission can abuse the `include` tag by crafting notification templates that `include` sensitive local files, such as `/etc/passwd` or `/proc/1/environ`. By configuring such a template for a notification rule (aka ""Alert""), and having it send notifications to a destination controlled by the actor, sensitive information may be leaked. The issue has been fixed in Dependency-Track 4.12.6. In fixed versions, the `include` tag can no longer be used. Usage of the tag will cause template evaluation to fail. As a workaround, avoid assigning the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission to untrusted users. The `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission per default is only granted to members of the `Administrators` team. Assigning this permission to non-administrative users or teams is a security risk in itself, and highly discouraged."	4.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

Prior to version 1.1.21, the application is vulnerable to an open redirect due to improper validation of the callbackURL parameter in the email verification endpoint and any other endpoint that accepts callback url. While the server blocks fully qualified URLs, it incorrectly allows scheme-less URLs. This results in the browser interpreting the URL as a fully qualified URL, leading to unintended redirection. An attacker can exploit this flaw by crafting a malicious verification link and tricking users into clicking it. Upon successful email verification, the user will be automatically redirected to the attacker's website, which can be used for phishing, malware distribution, or stealing sensitive authentication tokens. This CVE is a bypass of the fix for GHSA-8jhw-6pjj-8723/CVE-2024-56734. Version 1.1.21 contains an updated patch.	6.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

CVE-2025-27145	2025-02-25T02:15:16.300	2025-09-19T19:06:29.610	copyparty, a portable file server, has a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in versions prior to 1.16.15. The vulnerability is considered low-risk. By handing someone a maliciously-named file, and then tricking them into dragging the file into copyparty's Web-UI, an attacker could execute arbitrary javascript with the same privileges as that user. For example, this could give unintended read-access to files owned by that user. The bug is triggered by the drag-drop action itself; it is not necessary to actually initiate the upload. The file must be empty (zero bytes). Note that, as a general-purpose webserver, it is intentionally possible to upload HTML-files with arbitrary javascript in `<script>` tags, which will execute when the file is opened. The difference is that this vulnerability would trigger execution of javascript during the act of uploading, and not when the uploaded file was opened. Version 1.16.15 contains a fix.	3.6	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

CVE-2025-27148	2025-02-25T21:15:18.073	2025-02-25T21:15:18.073	"Gradle is a build automation tool, and its native-platform tool provides Java bindings for native APIs. On Unix-like systems, the system temporary directory can be created with open permissions that allow multiple users to create and delete files within it. This library initialization could be vulnerable to a local privilege escalation from an attacker quickly deleting and recreating files in the system temporary directory. Gradle builds that rely on versions of net.rubygrapefruit:native-platform prior to 0.22-milestone-28 could be vulnerable to a local privilege escalation from an attacker quickly deleting and recreating files in the system temporary directory.

In net.rubygrapefruit:native-platform prior to version 0.22-milestone-28, if the `Native.get(Class<>)` method was called, without calling `Native.init(File)` first, with a non-`null` argument used as working file path, then the library would initialize itself using the system temporary directory and NativeLibraryLocator.java lines 68 through 78. Version 0.22-milestone-28 has been released with changes that fix the problem. Initialization is now mandatory and no longer uses the system temporary directory, unless such a path is passed for initialization. The only workaround for affected versions is to make sure to do a proper initialization, using a location that is safe.

Gradle 8.12, only that exact version, had codepaths where the initialization of the underlying native integration library took a default path, relying on copying the binaries to the system temporary directory. Any execution of Gradle exposed this exploit. Users of Windows or modern versions of macOS are not vulnerable, nor are users of a Unix-like operating system with the ""sticky"" bit set or `noexec` on their system temporary directory vulnerable. This problem was fixed in Gradle 8.12.1. Gradle 8.13 release also upgrades to a version of the native library that no longer has that bug. Some workarounds are available. On Unix-like operating systems, ensure that the ""sticky"" bit is set. This only allows the original user (or root) to delete a file. Mounting `/tmp` as `noexec` will prevent Gradle 8.12 from starting. Those who are are unable to change the permissions of the system temporary directory can move the Java temporary directory by setting the System Property java.io.tmpdir. The new path needs to limit permissions to the build user only."	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

Remove the read / modify / write sequence to make the operation atomic
and remove the spin_lock() in change_page_attr().

To do the operation atomically, we can't use pte modification helpers
anymore. Because all platforms have different combination of bits, it
is not easy to use those bits directly. But all have the
_PAGE_KERNEL_{RO/ROX/RW/RWX} set of flags. All we need it to compare
two sets to know which bits are set or cleared.

For instance, by comparing _PAGE_KERNEL_ROX and _PAGE_KERNEL_RO you
know which bit gets cleared and which bit get set when changing exec

ath5k: fix OOB in ath5k_eeprom_read_pcal_info_5111

The bug was found during fuzzing. Stacktrace locates it in
ath5k_eeprom_convert_pcal_info_5111.
When none of the curve is selected in the loop, idx can go
up to AR5K_EEPROM_N_PD_CURVES. The line makes pd out of bound.
pd = &chinfo[pier].pd_curves[idx];

There are many OOB writes using pd later in the code. So I
added a sanity check for idx. Checks for other loops involving
AR5K_EEPROM_N_PD_CURVES are not needed as the loop index is not
used outside the loops.

The patch is NOT tested with real device.

The lock held by ctrl_cdev_ioctl is ubi_devices_mutex, but the lock held
by ubi_cdev_ioctl is ubi->device_mutex. Therefore, the two locks can be
concurrent.

ctrl_cdev_ioctl contains two operations: ubi_attach and ubi_detach.
ubi_detach is bug-free because it uses reference counting to prevent
concurrency. However, uif_init and uif_close in ubi_attach may race with
ubi_cdev_ioctl.

uif_init will race with ubi_cdev_ioctl as in the following stack.
           cpu1                   cpu2                  cpu3

The cause of this problem is that commit 714fb87e8bc0 make device
""available"" before it becomes accessible via sysfs. Therefore, we
roll back the modification. We will fix the race condition between
ubi device creation and udev by removing ubi_get_device in
vol_attribute_show and dev_attribute_show.This avoids accessing
uninitialized ubi_devices[ubi_num].

ubi_get_device is used to prevent devices from being deleted during
sysfs execution. However, now kernfs ensures that devices will not
be deleted before all reference counting are released.

Before the time, we should make clean a concept, what does refcount means
in page gotten from grab_cache_page_write_begin(). There are 2 situations:
Situation 1: refcount is 3, page is created by __page_cache_alloc.
  TYPE_A - the write process is using this page
  TYPE_B - page is assigned to one certain mapping by calling
	   __add_to_page_cache_locked()
  TYPE_C - page is added into pagevec list corresponding current cpu by
	   calling lru_cache_add()
Situation 2: refcount is 2, page is gotten from the mapping's tree
  TYPE_B - page has been assigned to one certain mapping
  TYPE_A - the write process is using this page (by calling
	   page_cache_get_speculative())
Filesystem releases one refcount by calling put_page() in xxx_write_end(),
the released refcount corresponds to TYPE_A (write task is using it). If
there are any processes using a page, page migration process will skip the
page by judging whether expected_page_refs() equals to page refcount.

UBIFS doesn't increase the page refcount after setting private flag, which
leads to page migration task believes the page is not used by any other
processes, so the page is migrated. This causes concurrent accessing on
page refcount between put_page() called by other process(eg. read process
calls lru_cache_add) and page_ref_unfreeze() called by mi

Function ubifs_wbuf_write_nolock() accepts that parameter 'len' is not 8
bytes aligned, the 'len' represents the true length of buf (which is
allocated in 'ubifs_jnl_xxx', eg. ubifs_jnl_write_inode), so
ubifs_wbuf_write_nolock() must handle the length read from 'buf' carefully
to write leb safely.

KVM: x86/mmu: Zap _all_ roots when unmapping gfn range in TDP MMU

Zap both valid and invalid roots when zapping/unmapping a gfn range, as
KVM must ensure it holds no references to the freed page after returning
from the unmap operation.  Most notably, the TDP MMU doesn't zap invalid
roots in mmu_notifier callbacks.  This leads to use-after-free and other
issues if the mmu_notifier runs to completion while an invalid root
zapper yields as KVM fails to honor the requirement that there must be
_no_ references to the page after the mmu_notifier returns.

The bug is most easily reproduced by hacking KVM to cause a collision
between set_nx_huge_pages() and kvm_mmu_notifier_release(), but the bug
exists between kvm_mmu_notifier_invalidate_range_start() and memslot
updates as well.  Invalidating a root ensures pages aren't accessible by
the guest, and KVM won't read or write page data itself, but KVM will
trigger e.g. kvm_set_pfn_dirty() when zapping SPTEs, and thus completing
a zap of an invalid root _after_ the mmu_notifier returns is fatal.

actually set via parent_hws, it should also have ""XO"" defined.
This will cause the kernel to panic on a NULL pointer in

clk_parent_data as well.

mm/secretmem: fix panic when growing a memfd_secret

When one tries to grow an existing memfd_secret with ftruncate, one gets
a panic [1].  For example, doing the following reliably induces the
panic:

    fd = memfd_secret();

    ftruncate(fd, 10);
    ptr = mmap(NULL, 10, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
    strcpy(ptr, ""123456789"");

    munmap(ptr, 10);
    ftruncate(fd, 20);

The basic reason for this is, when we grow with ftruncate, we call down
into simple_setattr, and then truncate_inode_pages_range, and eventually
we try to zero part of the memory.  The normal truncation code does this
via the direct map (i.e., it calls page_address() and hands that to
memset()).

For memfd_secret though, we specifically don't map our pages via the
direct map (i.e.  we call set_direct_map_invalid_noflush() on every
fault).  So the address returned by page_address() isn't useful, and
when we try to memset() with it we panic.

This patch avoids the panic by implementing a custom setattr for
memfd_secret, which detects resizes specifically (setting the size for
the first time works just fine, since there are no existing pages to try
to zero), and rejects them with EINVAL.

One could argue growing should be supported, but I think that will
require a significantly more lengthy change.  So, I propose a minimal
fix for the benefit of stable kernels, and then perhaps to extend
memfd_secret to support growing in a separate patch.

net: usb: aqc111: Fix out-of-bounds accesses in RX fixup

aqc111_rx_fixup() contains several out-of-bounds accesses that can be
triggered by a malicious (or defective) USB device, in particular:

 - The metadata array (desc_offset..desc_offset+2*pkt_count) can be out of bounds,
   causing OOB reads and (on big-endian systems) OOB endianness flips.
 - A packet can overlap the metadata array, causing a later OOB
   endianness flip to corrupt data used by a cloned SKB that has already
   been handed off into the network stack.
 - A packet SKB can be constructed whose tail is far beyond its end,
   causing out-of-bounds heap data to be considered part of the SKB's
   data.

Found doing variant analysis. Tested it with another driver (ax88179_178a), since
I don't have a aqc111 device to test it, but the code looks very similar."	6.8	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

mm: fix unexpected zeroed page mapping with zram swap

Two processes under CLONE_VM cloning, user process can be corrupted by
seeing zeroed page unexpectedly.

      CPU A                        CPU B

  return and next refault will
  read zeroed data

The swap_slot_free_notify is bogus for CLONE_VM case since it doesn't
increase the refcount of swap slot at copy_mm so it couldn't catch up
whether it's safe or not to discard data from backing device.  In the
case, only the lock it could rely on to synchronize swap slot freeing is
page table lock.  Thus, this patch gets rid of the swap_slot_free_notify
function.  With this patch, CPU A will see correct data.

      CPU A                        CPU B

  pte_lock
  if (!pte_same)
    goto out_nomap;
  pte_unlock
  return
  on next refault will see mapped data by CPU B

The concern of the patch would increase memory consumption since it
could keep wasted memory with compressed form in zram as well as
uncompressed form in address space.  However, most of cases of zram uses
no readahead and do_swap_page is followed by swap_free so it will free
the compressed form from in zram quickly."

nfc: nci: add flush_workqueue to prevent uaf

Our detector found a concurrent use-after-free bug when detaching an
NCI device. The main reason for this bug is the unexpected scheduling
between the used delayed mechanism (timer and workqueue).

The race can be demonstrated below:

Thread-1                           Thread-2
                                 | nci_dev_up()
                                 |   nci_open_device()
                                 |     __nci_request(nci_reset_req)
                                 |       nci_send_cmd
                                 |         queue_work(cmd_work)
nci_unregister_device()          |
  nci_close_device()             | ...
    del_timer_sync(cmd_timer)[1] |
...                              | Worker
nci_free_device()                | nci_cmd_work()
  kfree(ndev)[3]                 |   mod_timer(cmd_timer)[2]

In short, the cleanup routine thought that the cmd_timer has already
been detached by [1] but the mod_timer can re-attach the timer [2], even
it is already released [3], resulting in UAF.

This UAF is easy to trigger, crash trace by POC is like below

This is due to that free_irq_cpu_rmap() is always being called
*after* (devm_)free_irq() and thus it tries to work with IRQ descs
already freed. For example, on device reset the driver frees the
rmap right before allocating a new one (the splat above).
Make rmap creation and freeing function symmetrical with
{request,free}_irq() calls i.e. do that on ifup/ifdown instead
of device probe/remove/resume. These operations can be performed
independently from the actual device aRFS configuration.
Also, make sure ice_vsi_free_irq() clears IRQ affinity notifiers
only when aRFS is disabled -- otherwise, CPU rmap sets and clears
its own and they must not be touched manually."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

SUNRPC: Fix the svc_deferred_event trace class

Fix a NULL deref crash that occurs when an svc_rqst is deferred
while the sunrpc tracing subsystem is enabled. svc_revisit() sets
dr->xprt to NULL, so it can't be relied upon in the tracepoint to
provide the remote's address.

Unfortunately we can't revert the ""svc_deferred_class"" hunk in
commit ece200ddd54b (""sunrpc: Save remote presentation address in
svc_xprt for trace events"") because there is now a specific check
of event format specifiers for unsafe dereferences. The warning
that check emits is:

  event svc_defer_recv has unsafe dereference of argument 1

A ""%pISpc"" format specifier with a ""struct sockaddr *"" is indeed
flagged by this check.

Instead, take the brute-force approach used by the svcrdma_qp_error
tracepoint. Convert the dr::addr field into a presentation address
in the TP_fast_assign() arm of the trace event, and store that as
a string. This fix can be backported to -stable kernels.

In the meantime, commit c6ced22997ad (""tracing: Update print fmt
check to handle new __get_sockaddr() macro"") is now in v5.18, so
this wonky fix can be replaced with __sockaddr() and friends

powerpc: Fix virt_addr_valid() for 64-bit Book3E & 32-bit

mpe: On 64-bit Book3E vmalloc space starts at 0x8000000000000000.

Because of the way __pa() works we have:
  __pa(0x8000000000000000) == 0, and therefore
  virt_to_pfn(0x8000000000000000) == 0, and therefore
  virt_addr_valid(0x8000000000000000) == true

Which is wrong, virt_addr_valid() should be false for vmalloc space.
In fact all vmalloc addresses that alias with a valid PFN will return
true from virt_addr_valid(). That can cause bugs with hardened usercopy
as described below by Kefeng Wang:

  When running ethtool eth0 on 64-bit Book3E, a BUG occurred:

    usercopy: Kernel memory exposure attempt detected from SLUB object not in SLUB page?! (offset 0, size 1048)!
    kernel BUG at mm/usercopy.c:99

    __se_sys_ioctl+0xf0/0x160
    system_call_exception+0xfc/0x1f0
    system_call_common+0xf8/0x200

  The code shows below,

    data = vzalloc(array_size(gstrings.len, ETH_GSTRING_LEN));
    copy_to_user(useraddr, data, gstrings.len * ETH_GSTRING_LEN))

  The data is alloced by vmalloc(), virt_addr_valid(ptr) will return true
  on 64-bit Book3E, which leads to the panic.

  As commit 4dd7554a6456 (""powerpc/64: Add VIRTUAL_BUG_ON checks for __va
  and __pa addresses"") does, make sure the virt addr above PAGE_OFFSET in
  the virt_addr_valid() for 64-bit, also add upper limit check to make
  sure the virt is below high_memory.

  Meanwhile, for 32-bit PAGE_OFFSET is the virtual address of the start
  of lowmem, high_memory is the upper low virtual address, the check is
  suitable for 32-bit, this will fix the issue mentioned in commit
  602946ec2f90 (""powerpc: Set max_mapnr correctly"") too.

On 32-bit there is a similar problem with high memory, that was fixed in
commit 602946ec2f90 (""powerpc: Set max_mapnr correctly""), but that
commit breaks highmem and needs to be reverted.

We can't easily fix __pa(), we have code that relies on its current
behaviour. So for now add extra checks to virt_addr_valid().

For 64-bit Book3S the extra checks are not necessary, the combination of
virt_to_pfn() and pfn_valid() should yield the correct result, but they
are harmless.

btrfs: release correct delalloc amount in direct IO write path

Running generic/406 causes the following WARNING in btrfs_destroy_inode()
which tells there are outstanding extents left.

In btrfs_get_blocks_direct_write(), we reserve a temporary outstanding
extents with btrfs_delalloc_reserve_metadata() (or indirectly from
btrfs_delalloc_reserve_space(()). We then release the outstanding extents
with btrfs_delalloc_release_extents(). However, the ""len"" can be modified
in the COW case, which releases fewer outstanding extents than expected.

Fix it by calling btrfs_delalloc_release_extents() for the original length.

To reproduce the warning, the filesystem should be 1 GiB.  It's
triggering a short-write, due to not being able to allocate a large
extent and instead allocating a smaller one.

The bug [1] was introduced by commit 27599aacbaef (""fbdev: Hot-unplug
firmware fb devices on forced removal""). Most firmware framebuffers
have an underlying platform device, which can be hot-unplugged
before loading the native graphics driver. OF framebuffers do not
(yet) have that device. Fix the code by unregistering the framebuffer
as before without a hot unplug.

ata: sata_dwc_460ex: Fix crash due to OOB write

This is because sata_dwc_dma_xfer_complete() NULLs the
dma_pending's next neighbour ""chan"" (a *dma_chan struct) in
this '32' case right here (line ~735):
> hsdevp->dma_pending[tag] = SATA_DWC_DMA_PENDING_NONE;

Then the next time, a dma gets issued; dma_dwc_xfer_setup() passes
the NULL'd hsdevp->chan to the dmaengine_slave_config() which then
causes the crash.

With this patch, SATA_DWC_QCMD_MAX is now set to ATA_MAX_QUEUE + 1.
This avoids the OOB. But please note, there was a worthwhile discussion
on what ATA_TAG_INTERNAL and ATA_MAX_QUEUE is. And why there should not
be a ""fake"" 33 command-long queue size.

Ideally, the dw driver should account for the ATA_TAG_INTERNAL.
In Damien Le Moal's words: ""... having looked at the driver, it
is a bigger change than just faking a 33rd ""tag"" that is in fact
not a command tag at all.""

btrfs: fix qgroup reserve overflow the qgroup limit

We use extent_changeset->bytes_changed in qgroup_reserve_data() to record
how many bytes we set for EXTENT_QGROUP_RESERVED state. Currently the
bytes_changed is set as ""unsigned int"", and it will overflow if we try to
fallocate a range larger than 4GiB. The result is we reserve less bytes
and eventually break the qgroup limit.

Unlike regular buffered/direct write, which we use one changeset for
each ordered extent, which can never be larger than 256M.  For
fallocate, we use one changeset for the whole range, thus it no longer
respects the 256M per extent limit, and caused the problem.

The following example test script reproduces the problem:

  $ cat qgroup-overflow.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  DEV=/dev/sdj
  MNT=/mnt/sdj

  mkfs.btrfs -f $DEV
  mount $DEV $MNT

  # Set qgroup limit to 2GiB.
  btrfs quota enable $MNT
  btrfs qgroup limit 2G $MNT

  # Try to fallocate a 3GiB file. This should fail.
  echo
  echo ""Try to fallocate a 3GiB file...""
  fallocate -l 3G $MNT/3G.file

  # Try to fallocate a 5GiB file.
  echo
  echo ""Try to fallocate a 5GiB file...""
  fallocate -l 5G $MNT/5G.file

  # See we break the qgroup limit.
  echo
  sync
  btrfs qgroup show -r $MNT

  umount $MNT

When running the test:

  $ ./qgroup-overflow.sh

In some extreme corner cases when compressed data is suitably corrupted,

Instead of using the RCU on fs_devices->device_list we

the list of active devices.

We are in the chunk allocation thread. The newer chunk allocation
happens from the devices in the fs_device->alloc_list protected by the
chunk_mutex.

    gather_device_info
      list_for_each_entry(device, &fs_devices->alloc_list, dev_alloc_list)

Also, a device that reappears after the mount won't join the alloc_list
yet and, it will be in the dev_list, which we don't want to consider in
the context of the chunk alloc.

iommu/omap: Fix regression in probe for NULL pointer dereference

Commit 3f6634d997db (""iommu: Use right way to retrieve iommu_ops"") started
triggering a NULL pointer dereference for some omap variants:

__iommu_probe_device from probe_iommu_group+0x2c/0x38

This is caused by omap iommu probe returning 0 instead of ERR_PTR(-ENODEV)
as noted by Jason Gunthorpe <jgg@ziepe.ca>.

Looks like the regression already happened with an earlier commit

In get_initial_state, it calls notify_initial_state_done(skb,..) if
cb->args[5]==1. If genlmsg_put() failed in notify_initial_state_done(),
the skb will be freed by nlmsg_free(skb).
Then get_initial_state will goto out and the freed skb will be used by
return value skb->len, which is a uaf bug.

What's worse, the same problem goes even further: skb can also be
freed in the notify_*_state_change -> notify_*_state calls below.
Thus 4 additional uaf bugs happened.

My patch lets the problem callee functions: notify_initial_state_done
and notify_*_state_change return an error code if errors happen.
So that the error codes could be propagated and the uaf bugs can be avoid.

net: openvswitch: fix leak of nested actions

While parsing user-provided actions, openvswitch module may dynamically
allocate memory and store pointers in the internal copy of the actions.
So this memory has to be freed while destroying the actions.

Currently there are only two such actions: ct() and set().  However,
there are many actions that can hold nested lists of actions and
ovs_nla_free_flow_actions() just jumps over them leaking the memory.

For example, removal of the flow with the following actions will lead
to a leak of the memory allocated by nf_ct_tmpl_alloc():

  actions:clone(ct(commit),0)

Non-freed set() action may also leak the 'dst' structure for the
tunnel info including device references.

Under certain conditions with a high rate of flow rotation that may
cause significant memory leak problem (2MB per second in reporter's
case).  The problem is also hard to mitigate, because the user doesn't
have direct control over the datapath flows generated by OVS.

Fix that by iterating over all the nested actions and freeing
everything that needs to be freed recursively.

New build time assertion should protect us from this problem if new
actions will be added in the future.

Unfortunately, openvswitch module doesn't use NLA_F_NESTED, so all
attributes has to be explicitly checked.  sample() and clone() actions
are mixing extra attributes into the user-provided action list.  That
prevents some code generalization too."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

arch/arm64: Fix topology initialization for core scheduling

Arm64 systems rely on store_cpu_topology() to call update_siblings_masks()

before the call to notify_cpu_starting() which tells the scheduler about
each cpu found, otherwise the core scheduling data structures are setup

   cpuhp_invoke_callback_range()
     sched_cpu_starting()
       sched_core_cpu_starting()

Without this change stress-ng (which enables core scheduling in its prctl
tests in newer versions -- i.e. with PR_SCHED_CORE support) causes a warning

net: ipv4: fix route with nexthop object delete warning

FRR folks have hit a kernel warning[1] while deleting routes[2] which is
caused by trying to delete a route pointing to a nexthop id without
specifying nhid but matching on an interface. That is, a route is found
but we hit a warning while matching it. The warning is from
fib_info_nh() in include/net/nexthop.h because we run it on a fib_info
with nexthop object. The call chain is:
 inet_rtm_delroute -> fib_table_delete -> fib_nh_match (called with a
nexthop fib_info and also with fc_oif set thus calling fib_info_nh on
the fib_info and triggering the warning). The fix is to not do any
matching in that branch if the fi has a nexthop object because those are
managed separately. I.e. we should match when deleting without nh spec and
should fail when deleting a nexthop route with old-style nh spec because
nexthop objects are managed separately, e.g.:
 $ ip r show 1.2.3.4/32
 1.2.3.4 nhid 12 via 192.168.11.2 dev dummy0

 $ ip r del 1.2.3.4/32
 $ ip r del 1.2.3.4/32 nhid 12

CVE-2022-49093	2025-02-26T07:00:46.633	2025-03-25T16:20:55.483	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

skbuff: fix coalescing for page_pool fragment recycling

Fix a use-after-free when using page_pool with page fragments. We
encountered this problem during normal RX in the hns3 driver:

(1) Initially we have three descriptors in the RX queue. The first one
    allocates PAGE1 through page_pool, and the other two allocate one
    half of PAGE2 each. Page references look like this:

                RX_BD1 _______ PAGE1
                RX_BD2 _______ PAGE2
                RX_BD3 _________/

(2) Handle RX on the first descriptor. Allocate SKB1, eventually added
    to the receive queue by tcp_queue_rcv().

(3) Handle RX on the second descriptor. Allocate SKB2 and pass it to
    netif_receive_skb():

    netif_receive_skb(SKB2)
      ip_rcv(SKB2)
        SKB3 = skb_clone(SKB2)

    SKB2 and SKB3 share a reference to PAGE2 through
    skb_shinfo()->dataref. The other ref to PAGE2 is still held by
    RX_BD3:

                      SKB2 ---+- PAGE2
                      SKB3 __/   /
                RX_BD3 _________/

 (3b) Now while handling TCP, coalesce SKB3 with SKB1:

      tcp_v4_rcv(SKB3)
        tcp_try_coalesce(to=SKB1, from=SKB3)    // succeeds
        kfree_skb_partial(SKB3)
          skb_release_data(SKB3)                // drops one dataref

                      SKB1 _____ PAGE1
                           \____
                      SKB2 _____ PAGE2
                                 /
                RX_BD3 _________/

    In skb_try_coalesce(), __skb_frag_ref() takes a page reference to
    PAGE2, where it should instead have increased the page_pool frag
    reference, pp_frag_count. Without coalescing, when releasing both
    SKB2 and SKB3, a single reference to PAGE2 would be dropped. Now
    when releasing SKB1 and SKB2, two references to PAGE2 will be
    dropped, resulting in underflow.

 (3c) Drop SKB2:

      af_packet_rcv(SKB2)
        consume_skb(SKB2)
          skb_release_data(SKB2)                // drops second dataref
            page_pool_return_skb_page(PAGE2)    // drops one pp_frag_count

                      SKB1 _____ PAGE1
                           \____
                                 PAGE2
                                 /
                RX_BD3 _________/

(4) Userspace calls recvmsg()
    Copies SKB1 and releases it. Since SKB3 was coalesced with SKB1, we
    release the SKB3 page as well:

    tcp_eat_recv_skb(SKB1)
      skb_release_data(SKB1)
        page_pool_return_skb_page(PAGE1)
        page_pool_return_skb_page(PAGE2)        // drops second pp_frag_count

(5) PAGE2 is freed, but the third RX descriptor was still using it!
    In our case this causes IOMMU faults, but it would silently corrupt
    memory if the IOMMU was disabled.

Change the logic that checks whether pp_recycle SKBs can be coalesced.
We still reject differing pp_recycle between 'from' and 'to' SKBs, but
in order to avoid the situation described above, we also reject
coalescing when both 'from' and 'to' are pp_recycled and 'from' is
cloned.

The new logic allows coalescing a cloned pp_recycle SKB into a page
refcounted one, because in this case the release (4) will drop the right
reference, the one taken by skb_try_coalesce()."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

net: sfc: add missing xdp queue reinitialization

After rx/tx ring buffer size is changed, kernel panic occurs when
it acts XDP_TX or XDP_REDIRECT.

When tx/rx ring buffer size is changed(ethtool -G), sfc driver
reallocates and reinitializes rx and tx queues and their buffer
(tx_queue->buffer).
But it misses reinitializing xdp queues(efx->xdp_tx_queues).
So, while it is acting XDP_TX or XDP_REDIRECT, it uses the uninitialized
tx_queue->buffer.

A new function efx_set_xdp_channels() is separated from efx_set_channels()
to handle only xdp queues.

On systems where conntrack hash table is set to large value, most evictions
happen from gc worker rather than the packet path due to hash table
distribution.

This causes netlink event overflows when events are collected.

This change collects average expiry of scanned entries and
reschedules to the average remaining value, within 1 to 60 second interval.

CVE-2022-49124	2025-02-26T07:00:49.740	2025-02-26T07:00:49.740	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/mce: Work around an erratum on fast string copy instructions

A rare kernel panic scenario can happen when the following conditions
are met due to an erratum on fast string copy instructions:

1) An uncorrected error.
2) That error must be in first cache line of a page.
3) Kernel must execute page_copy from the page immediately before that
page.

The fast string copy instructions (""REP; MOVS*"") could consume an
uncorrectable memory error in the cache line _right after_ the desired
region to copy and raise an MCE.

Bit 0 of MSR_IA32_MISC_ENABLE can be cleared to disable fast string
copy and will avoid such spurious machine checks. However, that is less
preferable due to the permanent performance impact. Considering memory
poison is rare, it's desirable to keep fast string copy enabled until an
MCE is seen.

Intel has confirmed the following:
1. The CPU erratum of fast string copy only applies to Skylake,
Cascade Lake and Cooper Lake generations.

Directly return from the MCE handler:
2. Will result in complete execution of the ""REP; MOVS*"" with no data
loss or corruption.
3. Will not result in another MCE firing on the next poisoned cache line
due to ""REP; MOVS*"".
4. Will resume execution from a correct point in code.
5. Will result in the same instruction that triggered the MCE firing a
second MCE immediately for any other software recoverable data fetch
errors.
6. Is not safe without disabling the fast string copy, as the next fast
string copy of the same buffer on the same CPU would result in a PANIC
MCE.

This should mitigate the erratum completely with the only caveat that
the fast string copy is disabled on the affected hyper thread thus
performance degradation.

This is still better than the OS crashing on MCEs raised on an
irrelevant process due to ""REP; MOVS*' accesses in a kernel context,
e.g., copy_page.


Injected errors on 1st cache line of 8 anonymous pages of process
'proc1' and observed MCE consumption from 'proc2' with no panic
(directly returned).

Without the fix, the host panicked within a few minutes on a
random 'proc2' process due to kernel access from copy_page.

ath11k: mhi: use mhi_sync_power_up()

If amss.bin was missing ath11k would crash during 'rmmod ath11k_pci'. The
reason for that was that we were using mhi_async_power_up() which does not
check any errors. But mhi_sync_power_up() on the other hand does check for
errors so let's use that to fix the crash.

I was not able to find a reason why an async version was used.
ath11k_mhi_start() (which enables state ATH11K_MHI_POWER_ON) is called from
ath11k_hif_power_up(), which can sleep. So sync version should be safe to use
here.

The issue here is that board file loading happens after ath11k_pci_probe()
succesfully returns (ath11k initialisation happends asynchronously) and the
suspend handler is still enabled, of course failing as ath11k is not properly

mlxsw: spectrum: Guard against invalid local ports

When processing events generated by the device's firmware, the driver
protects itself from events reported for non-existent local ports, but
not for the CPU port (local port 0), which exists, but does not have all
the fields as any local port.

This can result in a NULL pointer dereference when trying access

net: preserve skb_end_offset() in skb_unclone_keeptruesize()

syzbot found another way to trigger the infamous WARN_ON_ONCE(delta < len)
in skb_try_coalesce() [1]

I was able to root cause the issue to kfence.

When kfence is in action, the following assertion is no longer true:

int size = xxxx;
void *ptr1 = kmalloc(size, gfp);
void *ptr2 = kmalloc(size, gfp);

if (ptr1 && ptr2)
	ASSERT(ksize(ptr1) == ksize(ptr2));

We attempted to fix these issues in the blamed commits, but forgot
that TCP was possibly shifting data after skb_unclone_keeptruesize()
has been used, notably from tcp_retrans_try_collapse().

So we not only need to keep same skb->truesize value,
we also need to make sure TCP wont fill new tailroom
that pskb_expand_head() was able to get from a
addr = kmalloc(...) followed by ksize(addr)

Split skb_unclone_keeptruesize() into two parts:

1) Inline skb_unclone_keeptruesize() for the common case,
   when skb is not cloned.

2) Out of line __skb_unclone_keeptruesize() for the 'slow path'.

This happens because we don't invoke .enable_cbs callback in

rxrpc: Fix call timer start racing with call destruction

The rxrpc_call struct has a timer used to handle various timed events
relating to a call.  This timer can get started from the packet input
routines that are run in softirq mode with just the RCU read lock held.
Unfortunately, because only the RCU read lock is held - and neither ref or
other lock is taken - the call can start getting destroyed at the same time
a packet comes in addressed to that call.  This causes the timer - which
was already stopped - to get restarted.  Later, the timer dispatch code may
then oops if the timer got deallocated first.

Fix this by trying to take a ref on the rxrpc_call struct and, if
successful, passing that ref along to the timer.  If the timer was already
running, the ref is discarded.

The timer completion routine can then pass the ref along to the call's work
item when it queues it.  If the timer or work item where already

Obvious solution to this is to introduce a reference counter. One reference
is taken for the normal code path (the 'good' case) and one for the timeout
path. As we always race between the normal good case and the timeout/abort
handler we need to serialize it. Also we cannot assume any order between
the handlers. Since this is slow path we can use proper synchronization via
locks.

When we are able to cancel a timer (del_timer returns 1) we know there
can't be any error handling in progress because the timeout handler hasn't
expired yet, thus we can safely decrement the refcounter by one.

If we are not able to cancel the timer, we know an abort handler is
running. We have to make sure we call sp->done() in the abort handlers
before calling kref_put()."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

powerpc/tm: Fix more userspace r13 corruption

Commit cf13435b730a (""powerpc/tm: Fix userspace r13 corruption"") fixes a
problem in treclaim where a SLB miss can occur on the
thread_struct->ckpt_regs while SCRATCH0 is live with the saved user r13
value, clobbering it with the kernel r13 and ultimately resulting in
kernel r13 being stored in ckpt_regs.

There is an equivalent problem in trechkpt where the user r13 value is
loaded into r13 from chkpt_regs to be recheckpointed, but a SLB miss
could occur on ckpt_regs accesses after that, which will result in r13
being clobbered with a kernel value and that will get recheckpointed and
then restored to user registers.

The same memory page is accessed right before this critical window where
a SLB miss could cause corruption, so hitting the bug requires the SLB
entry be removed within a small window of instructions, which is
possible if a SLB related MCE hits there. PAPR also permits the
hypervisor to discard this SLB entry (because slb_shadow->persistent is
only set to SLB_NUM_BOLTED) although it's not known whether any
implementations would do this (KVM does not). So this is an extremely
unlikely bug, only found by inspection.

Fix this by also storing user r13 in a temporary location on the kernel
stack and don't change the r13 register from kernel r13 until the RI=0
critical section that does not fault.

The SCRATCH0 change is not strictly part of the fix, it's only used in
the RI=0 section so it does not have the same problem as the previous
SCRATCH0 bug."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

ext4: don't BUG if someone dirty pages without asking ext4 first

[un]pin_user_pages_remote is dirtying pages without properly warning
the file system in advance.  A related race was noted by Jan Kara in
2018[1]; however, more recently instead of it being a very hard-to-hit
race, it could be reliably triggered by process_vm_writev(2) which was
discovered by Syzbot[2].

This is technically a bug in mm/gup.c, but arguably ext4 is fragile in
that if some other kernel subsystem dirty pages without properly
notifying the file system using page_mkwrite(), ext4 will BUG, while
other file systems will not BUG (although data will still be lost).

So instead of crashing with a BUG, issue a warning (since there may be
potential data loss) and just mark the page as clean to avoid
unprivileged denial of service attacks until the problem can be
properly fixed.  More discussion and background can be found in the
thread starting at [2].

These faults also affect performance. With pa8800/pa8900 processors,

The problem is fixed by using flush_cache_pages(). It does the flush

ext4: fix ext4_mb_mark_bb() with flex_bg with fast_commit

In case of flex_bg feature (which is by default enabled), extents for
any given inode might span across blocks from two different block group.
ext4_mb_mark_bb() only reads the buffer_head of block bitmap once for the
starting block group, but it fails to read it again when the extent length
boundary overflows to another block group. Then in this below loop it
accesses memory beyond the block group bitmap buffer_head and results
into a data abort.

	for (i = 0; i < clen; i++)
		if (!mb_test_bit(blkoff + i, bitmap_bh->b_data) == !state)

This patch adds this functionality for checking block group boundary in
ext4_mb_mark_bb() and update the buffer_head(bitmap_bh) for every different
block group.

w/o this patch, I was easily able to hit a data access abort using Power platform.

CVE-2022-49175	2025-02-26T07:00:54.600	2025-02-26T07:00:54.600	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PM: core: keep irq flags in device_pm_check_callbacks()

The function device_pm_check_callbacks() can be called under the spin
lock (in the reported case it happens from genpd_add_device() ->
dev_pm_domain_set(), when the genpd uses spinlocks rather than mutexes.

However this function uncoditionally uses spin_lock_irq() /
spin_unlock_irq(), thus not preserving the CPU flags. Use the
irqsave/irqrestore instead.

The backtrace for the reference:

The assumption when these were relaxed seems to be that device memory
would be mapped non reordering, and that other constructs
(spinlocks/etc) would provide the barriers to assure that packet data
and in memory rings/queues were ordered with respect to device
register reads/writes. This itself seems a bit sketchy, but the real
problem with GCC12 is that it is moving the actual reads/writes around
at will as though they were independent operations when in truth they
are not, but the compiler can't know that. When looking at the
assembly dumps for many of these routines its possible to see very
clean, but not strictly in program order operations occurring as the
compiler would be free to do if these weren't actually register
reads/write operations.

Its possible to suppress the timeout with a liberal bit of dma_mb()'s
sprinkled around but the device still seems unable to reliably
send/receive data. A better plan is to use the safer readl/writel
everywhere.

Since this partially reverts an older commit, which notes the use of
the relaxed variants for performance reasons. I would suggest that

net: dsa: fix panic on shutdown if multi-chip tree failed to probe

DSA probing is atypical because a tree of devices must probe all at
once, so out of N switches which call dsa_tree_setup_routing_table()
during probe, for (N - 1) of them, ""complete"" will return false and they
will exit probing early. The Nth switch will set up the whole tree on
their behalf.

The implication is that for (N - 1) switches, the driver binds to the
device successfully, without doing anything. When the driver is bound,
the ->shutdown() method may run. But if the Nth switch has failed to
initialize the tree, there is nothing to do for the (N - 1) driver
instances, since the slave devices have not been created, etc. Moreover,
dsa_switch_shutdown() expects that the calling @ds has been in fact
initialized, so it jumps at dereferencing the various data structures,
which is incorrect.

Avoid the ensuing NULL pointer dereferences by simply checking whether
the Nth switch has previously set ""ds->setup = true"" for the switch
which is currently shutting down. The entire setup is serialized under
dsa2_mutex which we already hold."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

af_netlink: Fix shift out of bounds in group mask calculation

When a netlink message is received, netlink_recvmsg() fills in the address
of the sender. One of the fields is the 32-bit bitfield nl_groups, which
carries the multicast group on which the message was received. The least
significant bit corresponds to group 1, and therefore the highest group
that the field can represent is 32. Above that, the UB sanitizer flags the
out-of-bounds shift attempts.

Which bits end up being set in such case is implementation defined, but
it's either going to be a wrong non-zero value, or zero, which is at least
not misleading. Make the latter choice deterministic by always setting to 0
for higher-numbered multicast groups.

To get information about membership in groups >= 32, userspace is expected
to use nl_pktinfo control messages[0], which are enabled by NETLINK_PKTINFO
socket option.

The way to trigger this issue is e.g. through monitoring the BRVLAN group:

	# bridge monitor vlan &
	# ip link add name br type bridge

The immediate cause of the crash is the access of tx_scrq in the following
snippet during a reset, where the tx_scrq can be either NULL or an address
that will soon be invalid:

	ibmvnic_xmit()
	{
		...
		tx_scrq = adapter->tx_scrq[queue_num];
		txq = netdev_get_tx_queue(netdev, queue_num);
		ind_bufp = &tx_scrq->ind_buf;

		if (test_bit(0, &adapter->resetting)) {
		...
	}

But beyond that, the call to ibmvnic_xmit() itself is not safe during a
reset and the reset path attempts to avoid this by stopping the queue in
ibmvnic_cleanup(). However just after the queue was stopped, an in-flight
ibmvnic_complete_tx() could have restarted the queue even as the reset is
progressing.

Since the queue was restarted we could get a call to ibmvnic_xmit() which
can then access the bad tx_scrq (or other fields).

We cannot however simply have ibmvnic_complete_tx() check the ->resetting
bit and skip starting the queue. This can race at the ""back-end"" of a good
reset which just restarted the queue but has not cleared the ->resetting
bit yet. If we skip restarting the queue due to ->resetting being true,
the queue would remain stopped indefinitely potentially leading to transmit
timeouts.

IOW ->resetting is too broad for this purpose. Instead use a new flag
that indicates whether or not the queues are active. Only the open/
reset paths control when the queues are active. ibmvnic_complete_tx()
and others wake up the queue only if the queue is marked active.

So we will have:
	A. reset/open thread in ibmvnic_cleanup() and __ibmvnic_open()

		->resetting = true
		->tx_queues_active = false
		disable tx queues
		...
		->tx_queues_active = true
		start tx queues

	B. Tx interrupt in ibmvnic_complete_tx():

		if (->tx_queues_active)
			netif_wake_subqueue();

To ensure that ->tx_queues_active and state of the queues are consistent,
we need a lock which:

	- must also be taken in the interrupt path (ibmvnic_complete_tx())
	- shared across the multiple

drm/amd/display: Fix double free during GPU reset on DC streams

[Why]
The issue only occurs during the GPU reset code path.

We first backup the current state prior to commiting 0 streams
internally from DM to DC. This state backup contains valid link
encoder assignments.

DC will clear the link encoder assignments as part of current state
(but not the backup, since it was a copied before the commit) and
free the extra stream reference it held.

DC requires that the link encoder assignments remain cleared/invalid
prior to commiting. Since the backup still has valid assignments we
call the interface post reset to clear them. This routine also
releases the extra reference that the link encoder interface held -
resulting in a double free (and eventually a NULL pointer dereference).

[How]
We'll have to do a full DC commit anyway after GPU reset because
the stream count previously went to 0.

We don't need to retain the assignment that we had backed up, so
just copy off of the now clean current state assignment after the
reset has occcurred with the new link_enc_cfg_copy() interface."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

If tcp_bpf_sendmsg() is running while sk msg is full. When sk_msg_alloc()

memory has been alloced by sk_msg_alloc(), that is, msg_tx->sg.size is

sk_msg_trim() to release the allocated memory, then goto wait for memory.

powerpc/64s: Don't use DSISR for SLB faults

Since commit 46ddcb3950a2 (""powerpc/mm: Show if a bad page fault on data
is read or write."") we use page_fault_is_write(regs->dsisr) in
__bad_page_fault() to determine if the fault is for a read or write, and
change the message printed accordingly.

But SLB faults, aka Data Segment Interrupts, don't set DSISR (Data
Storage Interrupt Status Register) to a useful value. All ISA versions
from v2.03 through v3.1 specify that the Data Segment Interrupt sets
DSISR ""to an undefined value"". As far as I can see there's no mention of
SLB faults setting DSISR in any BookIV content either.

This manifests as accesses that should be a read being incorrectly
reported as writes, for example, using the xmon ""dump"" command:

  0:mon> d 0x5deadbeef0000000
  5deadbeef0000000
  [359526.415354][    C6] BUG: Unable to handle kernel data access on write at 0x5deadbeef0000000

      pc: c00000000010a300: mread+0x90/0x190

If we disassemble the PC, we see a load instruction:

  0:mon> di c00000000010a300
  c00000000010a300 89490000      lbz     r10,0(r9)

We can also see in exceptions-64s.S that the data_access_slb block
doesn't set IDSISR=1, which means it doesn't load DSISR into pt_regs. So
the value we're using to determine if the fault is a read/write is some
stale value in pt_regs from a previous page fault.

Rework the printing logic to separate the SLB fault case out, and only
print read/write in the cases where we can determine it.

The result looks like eg:

Fix a race in the xsk socket teardown code that can lead to a NULL pointer

setting xs->state to XSK_UNBOUND, sets xs->dev to NULL and then waits for any

There are two problems with the current code. First, setting xs->dev to NULL
before waiting for all users to stop using the socket is not correct. The
entry to the data plane functions xsk_poll(), xsk_sendmsg(), and xsk_recvmsg()
are all guarded by a test that xs->state is in the state XSK_BOUND and if not,
it returns right away. But one process might have passed this test but still
have not gotten to the point in which it uses xs->dev in the code. In this
interim, a second process executing xsk_unbind_dev() might have set xs->dev to
NULL which will lead to a crash for the first process. The solution here is
just to get rid of this NULL assignment since it is not used anymore. Before
commit 42fddcc7c64b (""xsk: use state member for socket synchronization""),
xs->dev was the gatekeeper to admit processes into the data plane functions,
but it was replaced with the state variable xs->state in the aforementioned
commit.

The second problem is that synchronize_net() does not wait for any process in
xsk_poll(), xsk_sendmsg(), or xsk_recvmsg() to complete, which means that the
state they rely on might be cleaned up prematurely. This can happen when the
notifier gets called (at driver unload for example) as it uses xsk_unbind_dev().
Solve this by extending the RCU critical region from just the ndo_xsk_wakeup
to the whole functions mentioned above, so that both the test of xs->state ==
XSK_BOUND and the last use of any member of xs is covered by the RCU critical
section. This will guarantee that when synchronize_net() completes, there will
be no processes left executing xsk_poll(), xsk_sendmsg(), or xsk_recvmsg() and
state can be cleaned up safely. Note that we need to drop the RCU lock for the
skb xmit path as it uses functions that might sleep. Due to this, we have to
retest the xs->state after we grab the mutex that protects the skb xmit code
from, among a number of things, an xsk_unbind_dev() being executed from the
notifier at the same time."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

vfio/pci: fix memory leak during D3hot to D0 transition

If 'vfio_pci_core_device::needs_pm_restore' is set (PCI device does
not have No_Soft_Reset bit set in its PMCSR config register), then
the current PCI state will be saved locally in
'vfio_pci_core_device::pm_save' during D0->D3hot transition and same
will be restored back during D3hot->D0 transition.
For saving the PCI state locally, pci_store_saved_state() is being
used and the pci_load_and_free_saved_state() will free the allocated
memory.

But for reset related IOCTLs, vfio driver calls PCI reset-related
API's which will internally change the PCI power state back to D0. So,
when the guest resumes, then it will get the current state as D0 and it
will skip the call to vfio_pci_set_power_state() for changing the
power state to D0 explicitly. In this case, the memory pointed by
'pm_save' will never be freed. In a malicious sequence, the state changing
to D3hot followed by VFIO_DEVICE_RESET/VFIO_DEVICE_PCI_HOT_RESET can be
run in a loop and it can cause an OOM situation.

This patch frees the earlier allocated memory first before overwriting
'pm_save' to prevent the mentioned memory leak."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

The kasan error is triggered with an illegal BTF like below:
   type 0: void
   type 1: int
   type 2: decl_tag to func type 3
   type 3: func to func_proto type 8
The total number of types is 4 and the type 3 is illegal
since its func_proto type is out of range.

Currently, the target type of decl_tag can be struct/union, var or func.
Both struct/union and var implemented their own 'resolve' callback functions
and hence handled properly in kernel.
But func type doesn't have 'resolve' callback function. When
btf_decl_tag_resolve() tries to check func type, it tries to get
vlen of its func_proto type, which triggered the above kasan error.

To fix the issue, btf_decl_tag_resolve() needs to do btf_func_check()
before trying to accessing func_proto type.
In the current implementation, func type is checked with
btf_func_check() in the main checking function btf_check_all_types().
To fix the above kasan issue, let us implement 'resolve' callback
func type properly. The 'resolve' callback will be also called
in btf_check_all_types() for func types."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2022-49236	2025-02-26T07:01:00.600	2025-03-25T15:08:09.460	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix UAF due to race between btf_try_get_module and load_module

While working on code to populate kfunc BTF ID sets for module BTF from
its initcall, I noticed that by the time the initcall is invoked, the
module BTF can already be seen by userspace (and the BPF verifier). The
existing btf_try_get_module calls try_module_get which only fails if
mod->state == MODULE_STATE_GOING, i.e. it can increment module reference
when module initcall is happening in parallel.

Currently, BTF parsing happens from MODULE_STATE_COMING notifier
callback. At this point, the module initcalls have not been invoked.
The notifier callback parses and prepares the module BTF, allocates an
ID, which publishes it to userspace, and then adds it to the btf_modules
list allowing the kernel to invoke btf_try_get_module for the BTF.

However, at this point, the module has not been fully initialized (i.e.
its initcalls have not finished). The code in module.c can still fail
and free the module, without caring for other users. However, nothing
stops btf_try_get_module from succeeding between the state transition
from MODULE_STATE_COMING to MODULE_STATE_LIVE.

This leads to a use-after-free issue when BPF program loads
successfully in the state transition, load_module's do_init_module call
fails and frees the module, and BPF program fd on close calls module_put
for the freed module. Future patch has test case to verify we don't
regress in this area in future.

There are multiple points after prepare_coming_module (in load_module)
where failure can occur and module loading can return error. We
illustrate and test for the race using the last point where it can
practically occur (in module __init function).

An illustration of the race:

CPU 0                           CPU 1
			  load_module
			    notifier_call(MODULE_STATE_COMING)
			      btf_parse_module
			      btf_alloc_id	// Published to userspace
			      list_add(&btf_mod->list, btf_modules)
			    mod->init(...)
...				^
bpf_check		        |
check_pseudo_btf_id             |
  btf_try_get_module            |
    returns true                |  ...
...                             |  module __init in progress
return prog_fd                  |  ...
...                             V
			    if (ret < 0)
			      free_module(mod)
			    ...
close(prog_fd)
 ...
 bpf_prog_free_deferred
  module_put(used_btf.mod) // use-after-free

We fix this issue by setting a flag BTF_MODULE_F_LIVE, from the notifier
callback when MODULE_STATE_LIVE state is reached for the module, so that
we return NULL from btf_try_get_module for modules that are not fully
formed. Since try_module_get already checks that module is not in
MODULE_STATE_GOING state, and that is the only transition a live module
can make before being removed from btf_modules list, this is enough to
close the race and prevent the bug.

A later selftest patch crafts the race condition artifically to verify
that it has been fixed, and that verifier fails to load program (with
ENXIO).

Lastly, a couple of comments:

 1. Even if this race didn't exist, it seems more appropriate to only
    access resources (ksyms and kfuncs) of a fully formed module which
    has been initialized completely.

 2. This patch was born out of need for synchronization against module
    initcall for the next patch, so it is needed for correctness even
    without the aforementioned race condition. The BTF resources
    initialized by module initcall are set up once and then only looked
    up, so just waiting until the initcall has finished ensures correct
    behavior."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

exec: Force single empty string when argv is empty

Quoting[1] Ariadne Conill:

""In several other operating systems, it is a hard requirement that the
second argument to execve(2) be the name of a program, thus prohibiting
a scenario where argc < 1. POSIX 2017 also recommends this behaviour,
but it is not an explicit requirement[2]:

    The argument arg0 should point to a filename string that is
    associated with the process being started by one of the exec
    functions.
...
Interestingly, Michael Kerrisk opened an issue about this in 2008[3],
but there was no consensus to support fixing this issue then.
Hopefully now that CVE-2021-4034 shows practical exploitative use[4]
of this bug in a shellcode, we can reconsider.

This issue is being tracked in the KSPP issue tracker[5].""

While the initial code searches[6][7] turned up what appeared to be
mostly corner case tests, trying to that just reject argv == NULL
(or an immediately terminated pointer list) quickly started tripping[8]
existing userspace programs.

The next best approach is forcing a single empty string into argv and
adjusting argc to match. The number of programs depending on argc == 0
seems a smaller set than those calling execve with a NULL argv.

Account for the additional stack space in bprm_stack_limits(). Inject an
empty string when argc == 0 (and set argc = 1). Warn about the case so
userspace has some notice about the change:

    process './argc0' launched './argc0' with NULL argv: empty string added

Additionally WARN() and reject NULL argv usage for kernel threads.

CVE-2022-49266	2025-02-26T07:01:03.527	2025-02-26T07:01:03.527	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: fix rq-qos breakage from skipping rq_qos_done_bio()

a647a524a467 (""block: don't call rq_qos_ops->done_bio if the bio isn't
tracked"") made bio_endio() skip rq_qos_done_bio() if BIO_TRACKED is not set.
While this fixed a potential oops, it also broke blk-iocost by skipping the
done_bio callback for merged bios.

Before, whether a bio goes through rq_qos_throttle() or rq_qos_merge(),
rq_qos_done_bio() would be called on the bio on completion with BIO_TRACKED
distinguishing the former from the latter. rq_qos_done_bio() is not called
for bios which wenth through rq_qos_merge(). This royally confuses
blk-iocost as the merged bios never finish and are considered perpetually
in-flight.

One reliably reproducible failure mode is an intermediate cgroup geting
stuck active preventing its children from being activated due to the
leaf-only rule, leading to loss of control. The following is from
resctl-bench protection scenario which emulates isolating a web server like
workload from a memory bomb run on an iocost configuration which should
yield a reasonable level of protection.

The isolation result of 58.12% is close to what this device would show
without any IO control.

Fix it by introducing a new flag BIO_QOS_MERGED to mark merged bios and
calling rq_qos_done_bio() on them too. For consistency and clarity, rename
BIO_TRACKED to BIO_QOS_THROTTLED. The flag checks are moved into
rq_qos_done_bio() so that it's next to the code paths that set the flags.

With the patch applied, the above same benchmark shows:

cifs: prevent bad output lengths in smb2_ioctl_query_info()

When calling smb2_ioctl_query_info() with
smb_query_info::flags=PASSTHRU_FSCTL and
smb_query_info::output_buffer_length=0, the following would return
0x10

	buffer = memdup_user(arg + sizeof(struct smb_query_info),
			     qi.output_buffer_length);
	if (IS_ERR(buffer)) {
		kfree(vars);
		return PTR_ERR(buffer);
	}

rather than a valid pointer thus making IS_ERR() check fail.  This
would then cause a NULL ptr deference in @buffer when accessing it
later in smb2_ioctl_query_ioctl().  While at it, prevent having a
@buffer smaller than 8 bytes to correctly handle SMB2_SET_INFO
FileEndOfFileInformation requests when
smb_query_info::flags=PASSTHRU_SET_INFO.

ALSA: pcm: Fix potential AB/BA lock with buffer_mutex and mmap_lock

syzbot caught a potential deadlock between the PCM
runtime->buffer_mutex and the mm->mmap_lock.  It was brought by the
recent fix to cover the racy read/write and other ioctls, and in that
commit, I overlooked a (hopefully only) corner case that may take the
revert lock, namely, the OSS mmap.  The OSS mmap operation
exceptionally allows to re-configure the parameters inside the OSS
mmap syscall, where mm->mmap_mutex is already held.  Meanwhile, the
copy_from/to_user calls at read/write operations also take the
mm->mmap_lock internally, hence it may lead to a AB/BA deadlock.

A similar problem was already seen in the past and we fixed it with a
refcount (in commit b248371628aa).  The former fix covered only the
call paths with OSS read/write and OSS ioctls, while we need to cover
the concurrent access via both ALSA and OSS APIs now.

This patch addresses the problem above by replacing the buffer_mutex
lock in the read/write operations with a refcount similar as we've
used for OSS.  The new field, runtime->buffer_accessing, keeps the
number of concurrent read/write operations.  Unlike the former
buffer_mutex protection, this protects only around the
copy_from/to_user() calls; the other codes are basically protected by
the PCM stream lock.  The refcount can be a negative, meaning blocked
by the ioctls.  If a negative value is seen, the read/write aborts
with -EBUSY.  In the ioctl side, OTOH, they check this refcount, too,
and set to a negative value for blocking unless it's already being
accessed."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

The reason for this warning is the attempt to get the chip->dev reference
in tpm_common_write() although the reference counter is already zero.

Since commit 8979b02aaf1d (""tpm: Fix reference count to main device"") the
extra reference used to prevent a premature zero counter is never taken,
because the required TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 flag is never set.

Fix this by moving the TPM 2 character device handling from
tpm_chip_alloc() to tpm_add_char_device() which is called at a later point
in time when the flag has been set in case of TPM2.

Commit fdc915f7f719 (""tpm: expose spaces via a device link /dev/tpmrm<n>"")
already introduced function tpm_devs_release() to release the extra
reference but did not implement the required put on chip->devs that results
in the call of this function.

Fix this by putting chip->devs in tpm_chip_unregister().

Finally move the new implementation for the TPM 2 handling into a new
function to avoid multiple checks for the TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 flag in the
good case and error cases."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

mac80211: fix potential double free on mesh join

While commit 6a01afcf8468 (""mac80211: mesh: Free ie data when leaving
mesh"") fixed a memory leak on mesh leave / teardown it introduced a
potential memory corruption caused by a double free when rejoining the
mesh:

  ieee80211_leave_mesh()
  -> kfree(sdata->u.mesh.ie);
  ...
  ieee80211_join_mesh()
  -> copy_mesh_setup()
     -> old_ie = ifmsh->ie;
     -> kfree(old_ie);

This double free / kernel panics can be reproduced by using wpa_supplicant
with an encrypted mesh (if set up without encryption via ""iw"" then
ifmsh->ie is always NULL, which avoids this issue). And then calling:

  $ iw dev mesh0 mesh leave
  $ iw dev mesh0 mesh join my-mesh

Note that typically these commands are not used / working when using
wpa_supplicant. And it seems that wpa_supplicant or wpa_cli are going
through a NETDEV_DOWN/NETDEV_UP cycle between a mesh leave and mesh join
where the NETDEV_UP resets the mesh.ie to NULL via a memcpy of
default_mesh_setup in cfg80211_netdev_notifier_call, which then avoids
the memory corruption, too.

The issue was first observed in an application which was not using
wpa_supplicant but ""Senf"" instead, which implements its own calls to
nl80211.

Fixing the issue by removing the kfree()'ing of the mesh IE in the mesh
join function and leaving it solely up to the mesh leave to free the
mesh IE."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

ALSA: oss: Fix PCM OSS buffer allocation overflow

We've got syzbot reports hitting INT_MAX overflow at vmalloc()
allocation that is called from snd_pcm_plug_alloc().  Although we
apply the restrictions to input parameters, it's based only on the
hw_params of the underlying PCM device.  Since the PCM OSS layer
allocates a temporary buffer for the data conversion, the size may
become unexpectedly large when more channels or higher rates is given;
in the reported case, it went over INT_MAX, hence it hits WARN_ON().

This patch is an attempt to avoid such an overflow and an allocation
for too large buffers.  First off, it adds the limit of 1MB as the
upper bound for period bytes.  This must be large enough for all use
cases, and we really don't want to handle a larger temporary buffer
than this size.  The size check is performed at two places, where the
original period bytes is calculated and where the plugin buffer size
is calculated.

In addition, the driver uses array_size() and array3_size() for
multiplications to catch overflows for the converted period size and

ceph: fix possible deadlock when holding Fwb to get inline_data

1, mount with wsync.
2, create a file with O_RDWR, and the request was sent to mds.0:

   ceph_atomic_open()-->
     ceph_mdsc_do_request(openc)
     finish_open(file, dentry, ceph_open)-->
       ceph_open()-->
         ceph_init_file()-->

             ceph_uninline_data()-->

               ...
               if (inline_version == 1 || /* initial version, no data */
                   inline_version == CEPH_INLINE_NONE)
                     goto out_unlock;
               ...
             }

The inline_version will be 1, which is the initial version for the
new create file. And here the ci->i_inline_version will keep with 1,
it's buggy.

3, buffer write to the file immediately:

   ceph_write_iter()-->
     ceph_get_caps(file, need=Fw, want=Fb, ...);
     generic_perform_write()-->
       a_ops->write_begin()-->

                   rreq->netfs_ops->issue_read()-->

                     }
     ceph_put_cap_refs(ci, Fwb);

The ceph_netfs_issue_op_inline() will send a getattr(Fsr) request to
mds.1.

4, then the mds.1 will request the rd lock for CInode::filelock from
the auth mds.0, the mds.0 will do the CInode::filelock state transation
from excl --> sync, but it need to revoke the Fxwb caps back from the
clients.

While the kernel client has aleady held the Fwb caps and waiting for
the getattr(Fsr).

It's deadlock!

nbd: fix race between nbd_alloc_config() and module removal

When nbd module is being removing, nbd_alloc_config() may be
called concurrently by nbd_genl_connect(), although try_module_get()
will return false, but nbd_alloc_config() doesn't handle it.

The race may lead to the leak of nbd_config and its related
resources (e.g, recv_workq) and oops in nbd_read_stat() due
to the unload of nbd module as shown below:

  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000040

Fixing it by checking the return value of try_module_get()
in nbd_alloc_config(). As nbd_alloc_config() may return ERR_PTR(-ENODEV),
assign nbd->config only when nbd_alloc_config() succeeds to ensure
the value of nbd->config is binary (valid or NULL).

Also adding a debug message to check the reference counter

rtl818x: Prevent using not initialized queues

Using not existing queues can panic the kernel with rtl8180/rtl8185 cards.
Ignore the skb priority for those cards, they only have one tx queue. Pierre
Asselin (pa@panix.com) reported the kernel crash in the Gentoo forum:

https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-1147832-postdays-0-postorder-asc-start-25.html

He also confirmed that this patch fixes the issue. In summary this happened:

After updating wpa_supplicant from 2.9 to 2.10 the kernel crashed with a
""divide error: 0000"" when connecting to an AP. Control port tx now tries to
use IEEE80211_AC_VO for the priority, which wpa_supplicants starts to use in
2.10.

Since only the rtl8187se part of the driver supports QoS, the priority
of the skb is set to IEEE80211_AC_BE (2) by mac80211 for rtl8180/rtl8185
cards.

rtl8180 is then unconditionally reading out the priority and finally crashes on
drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtl818x/rtl8180/dev.c line 544 without this
patch:
	idx = (ring->idx + skb_queue_len(&ring->queue)) % ring->entries

""ring->entries"" is zero for rtl8180/rtl8185 cards, tx_ring[2] never got

bcache: avoid journal no-space deadlock by reserving 1 journal bucket

The journal no-space deadlock was reported time to time. Such deadlock
can happen in the following situation.

When all journal buckets are fully filled by active jset with heavy
write I/O load, the cache set registration (after a reboot) will load
all active jsets and inserting them into the btree again (which is
called journal replay). If a journaled bkey is inserted into a btree
node and results btree node split, new journal request might be
triggered. For example, the btree grows one more level after the node
split, then the root node record in cache device super block will be
upgrade by bch_journal_meta() from bch_btree_set_root(). But there is no
space in journal buckets, the journal replay has to wait for new journal
bucket to be reclaimed after at least one journal bucket replayed. This
is one example that how the journal no-space deadlock happens.

The solution to avoid the deadlock is to reserve 1 journal bucket in
run time, and only permit the reserved journal bucket to be used during
cache set registration procedure for things like journal replay. Then
the journal space will never be fully filled, there is no chance for
journal no-space deadlock to happen anymore.

This patch adds a new member ""bool do_reserve"" in struct journal, it is
inititalized to 0 (false) when struct journal is allocated, and set to
1 (true) by bch_journal_space_reserve() when all initialization done in
run_cache_set(). In the run time when journal_reclaim() tries to
allocate a new journal bucket, free_journal_buckets() is called to check
whether there are enough free journal buckets to use. If there is only
1 free journal bucket and journal->do_reserve is 1 (true), the last
bucket is reserved and free_journal_buckets() will return 0 to indicate
no free journal bucket. Then journal_reclaim() will give up, and try
next time to see whetheer there is free journal bucket to allocate. By
this method, there is always 1 jouranl bucket reserved in run time.

During the cache set registration, journal->do_reserve is 0 (false), so
the reserved journal bucket can be used to avoid the no-space deadlock."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

tcp: fix tcp_mtup_probe_success vs wrong snd_cwnd

syzbot got a new report [1] finally pointing to a very old bug,
added in initial support for MTU probing.

tcp_mtu_probe() has checks about starting an MTU probe if
tcp_snd_cwnd(tp) >= 11.

But nothing prevents tcp_snd_cwnd(tp) to be reduced later
and before the MTU probe succeeds.

This bug would lead to potential zero-divides.

Debugging added in commit 40570375356c (""tcp: add accessors
to read/set tp->snd_cwnd"") has paid off :)

While we are at it, address potential overflows in this code.

ocfs2: dlmfs: fix error handling of user_dlm_destroy_lock

When user_dlm_destroy_lock failed, it didn't clean up the flags it set
before exit.  For USER_LOCK_IN_TEARDOWN, if this function fails because of
lock is still in used, next time when unlink invokes this function, it
will return succeed, and then unlink will remove inode and dentry if lock
is not in used(file closed), but the dlm lock is still linked in dlm lock
resource, then when bast come in, it will trigger a panic due to
user-after-free.  See the following panic call trace.  To fix this,
USER_LOCK_IN_TEARDOWN should be reverted if fail.  And also error should
be returned if USER_LOCK_IN_TEARDOWN is set to let user know that unlink
fail.

For the case of ocfs2_dlm_unlock failure, besides USER_LOCK_IN_TEARDOWN,
USER_LOCK_BUSY is also required to be cleared.  Even though spin lock is
released in between, but USER_LOCK_IN_TEARDOWN is still set, for
USER_LOCK_BUSY, if before every place that waits on this flag,
USER_LOCK_IN_TEARDOWN is checked to bail out, that will make sure no flow
waits on the busy flag set by user_dlm_destroy_lock(), then we can
simplely revert USER_LOCK_BUSY when ocfs2_dlm_unlock fails.  Fix
user_dlm_cluster_lock() which is the only function not following this.

net/mlx5e: CT: Fix cleanup of CT before cleanup of TC ct rules

CT cleanup assumes that all tc rules were deleted first, and so
is free to delete the CT shared resources (e.g the dr_action
fwd_action which is shared for all tuples). But currently for
uplink, this is happens in reverse, causing the below trace.

CT cleanup is called from:
mlx5e_cleanup_rep_tx()->mlx5e_cleanup_uplink_rep_tx()->
mlx5e_rep_tc_cleanup()->mlx5e_tc_esw_cleanup()->
mlx5_tc_ct_clean()

Only afterwards, tc cleanup is called from:
mlx5e_cleanup_rep_tx()->mlx5e_tc_ht_cleanup()
which would have deleted all the tc ct rules, and so delete
all the offloaded tuples.

Fix this reversing the order of init and on cleanup, which
will result in tc cleanup then ct cleanup.

CVE-2022-49339	2025-02-26T07:01:10.657	2025-09-22T20:26:28.693	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ipv6: unexport __init-annotated seg6_hmac_init()

EXPORT_SYMBOL and __init is a bad combination because the .init.text
section is freed up after the initialization. Hence, modules cannot
use symbols annotated __init. The access to a freed symbol may end up
with kernel panic.

modpost used to detect it, but it has been broken for a decade.

Recently, I fixed modpost so it started to warn it again, then this
showed up in linux-next builds.

There are two ways to fix it:

  - Remove __init
  - Remove EXPORT_SYMBOL

I chose the latter for this case because the caller (net/ipv6/seg6.c)
and the callee (net/ipv6/seg6_hmac.c) belong to the same module.
It seems an internal function call in ipv6.ko."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

ip_gre: test csum_start instead of transport header

GRE with TUNNEL_CSUM will apply local checksum offload on
CHECKSUM_PARTIAL packets.

ipgre_xmit must validate csum_start after an optional skb_pull,
else lco_csum may trigger an overflow. The original check was

	if (csum && skb_checksum_start(skb) < skb->data)
		return -EINVAL;

This had false positives when skb_checksum_start is undefined:
when ip_summed is not CHECKSUM_PARTIAL. A discussed refinement
was straightforward

	if (csum && skb->ip_summed == CHECKSUM_PARTIAL &&
	    skb_checksum_start(skb) < skb->data)
		return -EINVAL;

But was eventually revised more thoroughly:
- restrict the check to the only branch where needed, in an
  uncommon GRE path that uses header_ops and calls skb_pull.
- test skb_transport_header, which is set along with csum_start
  in skb_partial_csum_set in the normal header_ops datapath.

Turns out skbs can arrive in this branch without the transport
header set, e.g., through BPF redirection.

Revise the check back to check csum_start directly, and only if
CHECKSUM_PARTIAL. Do leave the check in the updated location.
Check field regardless of whether TUNNEL_CSUM is configured."

bpf, arm64: Clear prog->jited_len along prog->jited

syzbot reported an illegal copy_to_user() attempt
from bpf_prog_get_info_by_fd() [1]

There was no repro yet on this bug, but I think
that commit 0aef499f3172 (""mm/usercopy: Detect vmalloc overruns"")
is exposing a prior bug in bpf arm64.

bpf_prog_get_info_by_fd() looks at prog->jited_len
to determine if the JIT image can be copied out to user space.

My theory is that syzbot managed to get a prog where prog->jited_len
has been set to 43, while prog->bpf_func has ben cleared.

It is not clear why copy_to_user(uinsns, NULL, ulen) is triggering
this particular warning.

I thought find_vma_area(NULL) would not find a vm_struct.
As we do not hold vmap_area_lock spinlock, it might be possible
that the found vm_struct was garbage.

The EXT4_FC_REPLAY bit in sbi->s_mount_state is used to indicate that

actually a mistake, since the sbi->s_mount_info is initialized from

The problem with using EXT4_FC_REPLAY is that a maliciously corrupted

a BUG() in ext4_es_cache_extent().  As a easy-to-backport-fix, filter

EXPORT_SYMBOL and __init is a bad combination because the .init.text

use symbols annotated __init. The access to a freed symbol may end up
with kernel panic.

modpost used to detect it, but it has been broken for a decade.

Recently, I fixed modpost so it started to warn it again, then this
showed up in linux-next builds.

There are two ways to fix it:

  - Remove __init
  - Remove EXPORT_SYMBOL

 Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception

On investigation looks like this panic was caused due to a 'stat_buffer' of
size==0 being provided to drc_pmem_query_stats() to fetch all performance
stats-ids of an NVDIMM. However drc_pmem_query_stats() shouldn't have been called
since the vPMEM NVDIMM doesn't support and performance stat-id's. This was caused
due to missing check for 'p->stat_buffer_len' at the beginning of
papr_scm_pmu_check_events() which indicates that the NVDIMM doesn't support
performance-stats.

Fix this by introducing the check for 'p->stat_buffer_len' at the beginning of
papr_scm_pmu_check_events().

the loop without decrementing the reference count of the object
""posix_acls"", which is increased by get_acl() earlier. This may
result in memory leaks.

Fix it by decreasing the reference count of ""posix_acls"" before
jumping to label ""check_access_bits""."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

tcp: tcp_rtx_synack() can be called from process context

Laurent reported the enclosed report [1]

This bug triggers with following coditions:

0) Kernel built with CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT=y

1) A new passive FastOpen TCP socket is created.
   This FO socket waits for an ACK coming from client to be a complete
   ESTABLISHED one.
2) A socket operation on this socket goes through lock_sock()
   release_sock() dance.
3) While the socket is owned by the user in step 2),
   a retransmit of the SYN is received and stored in socket backlog.
4) At release_sock() time, the socket backlog is processed while
   in process context.
5) A SYNACK packet is cooked in response of the SYN retransmit.
6) -> tcp_rtx_synack() is called in process context.

Before blamed commit, tcp_rtx_synack() was always called from BH handler,
from a timer handler.

Fix this by using TCP_INC_STATS() & NET_INC_STATS()
which do not assume caller is in non preemptible context.

driver core: Fix wait_for_device_probe() & deferred_probe_timeout interaction

Mounting NFS rootfs was timing out when deferred_probe_timeout was
non-zero [1].  This was because ip_auto_config() initcall times out
waiting for the network interfaces to show up when
deferred_probe_timeout was non-zero. While ip_auto_config() calls
wait_for_device_probe() to make sure any currently running deferred
probe work or asynchronous probe finishes, that wasn't sufficient to
account for devices being deferred until deferred_probe_timeout.

Commit 35a672363ab3 (""driver core: Ensure wait_for_device_probe() waits
until the deferred_probe_timeout fires"") tried to fix that by making
sure wait_for_device_probe() waits for deferred_probe_timeout to expire
before returning.

However, if wait_for_device_probe() is called from the kernel_init()
context:

- Before deferred_probe_initcall() [2], it causes the boot process to
  hang due to a deadlock.

- After deferred_probe_initcall() [3], it blocks kernel_init() from
  continuing till deferred_probe_timeout expires and beats the point of
  deferred_probe_timeout that's trying to wait for userspace to load
  modules.

Neither of this is good. So revert the changes to
wait_for_device_probe().

CVE-2022-49394	2025-02-26T07:01:15.983	2025-02-26T07:01:15.983	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-iolatency: Fix inflight count imbalances and IO hangs on offline

iolatency needs to track the number of inflight IOs per cgroup. As this
tracking can be expensive, it is disabled when no cgroup has iolatency
configured for the device. To ensure that the inflight counters stay
balanced, iolatency_set_limit() freezes the request_queue while manipulating
the enabled counter, which ensures that no IO is in flight and thus all
counters are zero.

Unfortunately, iolatency_set_limit() isn't the only place where the enabled
counter is manipulated. iolatency_pd_offline() can also dec the counter and
trigger disabling. As this disabling happens without freezing the q, this
can easily happen while some IOs are in flight and thus leak the counts.

This can be easily demonstrated by turning on iolatency on an one empty
cgroup while IOs are in flight in other cgroups and then removing the
cgroup. Note that iolatency shouldn't have been enabled elsewhere in the
system to ensure that removing the cgroup disables iolatency for the whole
device.

The following keeps flipping on and off iolatency on sda:

  echo +io > /sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.subtree_control
  while true; do
      mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/test
      echo '8:0 target=100000' > /sys/fs/cgroup/test/io.latency
      sleep 1
      rmdir /sys/fs/cgroup/test
      sleep 1
  done

and there's concurrent fio generating direct rand reads:

  fio --name test --filename=/dev/sda --direct=1 --rw=randread \
      --runtime=600 --time_based --iodepth=256 --numjobs=4 --bs=4k

while monitoring with the following drgn script:

  while True:
    for css in css_for_each_descendant_pre(prog['blkcg_root'].css.address_of_()):
        for pos in hlist_for_each(container_of(css, 'struct blkcg', 'css').blkg_list):
            blkg = container_of(pos, 'struct blkcg_gq', 'blkcg_node')
            pd = blkg.pd[prog['blkcg_policy_iolatency'].plid]
            if pd.value_() == 0:
                continue
            iolat = container_of(pd, 'struct iolatency_grp', 'pd')
            inflight = iolat.rq_wait.inflight.counter.value_()
            if inflight:
                print(f'inflight={inflight} {disk_name(blkg.q.disk).decode(""utf-8"")} '
                      f'{cgroup_path(css.cgroup).decode(""utf-8"")}')
    time.sleep(1)

The monitoring output looks like the following:

  inflight=1 sda /user.slice
  inflight=1 sda /user.slice
  ...
  inflight=14 sda /user.slice
  inflight=13 sda /user.slice
  inflight=17 sda /user.slice
  inflight=15 sda /user.slice
  inflight=18 sda /user.slice
  inflight=17 sda /user.slice
  inflight=20 sda /user.slice
  inflight=19 sda /user.slice <- fio stopped, inflight stuck at 19
  inflight=19 sda /user.slice
  inflight=19 sda /user.slice

If a cgroup with stuck inflight ends up getting throttled, the throttled IOs
will never get issued as there's no completion event to wake it up leading
to an indefinite hang.

This patch fixes the bug by unifying enable handling into a work item which
is automatically kicked off from iolatency_set_min_lat_nsec() which is
called from both iolatency_set_limit() and iolatency_pd_offline() paths.
Punting to a work item is necessary as iolatency_pd_offline() is called
under spinlocks while freezing a request_queue requires a sleepable context.

This also simplifies the code reducing LOC sans the comments and avoids the
unnecessary freezes which were happening whenever a cgroup's latency target
is newly set or cleared."

usb: dwc3: gadget: Replace list_for_each_entry_safe() if using giveback

The list_for_each_entry_safe() macro saves the current item (n) and
the item after (n+1), so that n can be safely removed without
corrupting the list.  However, when traversing the list and removing
items using gadget giveback, the DWC3 lock is briefly released,
allowing other routines to execute.  There is a situation where, while
items are being removed from the cancelled_list using
dwc3_gadget_ep_cleanup_cancelled_requests(), the pullup disable
routine is running in parallel (due to UDC unbind).  As the cleanup
routine removes n, and the pullup disable removes n+1, once the
cleanup retakes the DWC3 lock, it references a request who was already
removed/handled.  With list debug enabled, this leads to a panic.

One way to trigger this is:
  1. load a livepatch that patches kernel function xxx;
  2. run bpftrace -e 'kfunc:xxx {}', this will fail (expected for now);
  3. repeat #2 => gpf.

This is because the entry is added to direct_functions, but not removed.
Fix this by remove the entry from direct_functions when
register_ftrace_direct fails.

Also remove the last trailing space from ftrace.c, so we don't have to
worry about it anymore."

dlm: fix plock invalid read

This patch fixes an invalid read showed by KASAN. A unlock will allocate a
""struct plock_op"" and a followed send_op() will append it to a global
send_list data structure. In some cases a followed dev_read() moves it
to recv_list and dev_write() will cast it to ""struct plock_xop"" and access
fields which are only available in those structures. At this point an
invalid read happens by accessing those fields.

To fix this issue the ""callback"" field is moved to ""struct plock_op"" to
indicate that a cast to ""plock_xop"" is allowed and does the additional
""plock_xop"" handling if set.

Example of the KASAN output which showed the invalid read:

if prev is 0, no error is returned even if lblock<=prev.
This was intended to skip the check on the first extent, but
in the error image above, prev=0+1-1=0 when checking the second extent,
so even though lblock<=prev, the function does not return an error.
As a result, bug_ON occurs in __es_tree_search and the system panics.

To solve this problem, we only need to check that:
1. The lblock of the first extent is not less than 0.
2. The lblock of the next extent  is not less than
   the next block of the previous extent.
The same applies to extent_idx."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

video: fbdev: vesafb: Fix a use-after-free due early fb_info cleanup

Commit b3c9a924aab6 (""fbdev: vesafb: Cleanup fb_info in .fb_destroy rather
than .remove"") fixed a use-after-free error due the vesafb driver freeing
the fb_info in the .remove handler instead of doing it in .fb_destroy.

This can happen if the .fb_destroy callback is executed after the .remove
callback, since the former tries to access a pointer freed by the latter.

But that change didn't take into account that another possible scenario is
that .fb_destroy is called before the .remove callback. For example, if no
process has the fbdev chardev opened by the time the driver is removed.

If that's the case, fb_info will be freed when unregister_framebuffer() is
called, making the fb_info pointer accessed in vesafb_remove() after that
to no longer be valid.

To prevent that, move the expression containing the info->par to happen
before the unregister_framebuffer() function call."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

iommu/mediatek: Fix NULL pointer dereference when printing dev_name

When larbdev is NULL (in the case I hit, the node is incorrectly set
iommus = <&iommu NUM>), it will cause device_link_add() fail and
kernel crashes when we try to print dev_name(larbdev).

Let's fail the probe if a larbdev is NULL to avoid invalid inputs from
dts.

It should work for normal correct setting and avoid the crash caused
by my incorrect setting.

f2fs: fix dereference of stale list iterator after loop body

The list iterator variable will be a bogus pointer if no break was hit.
Dereferencing it (cur->page in this case) could load an out-of-bounds/undefined
value making it unsafe to use that in the comparision to determine if the
specific element was found.

Since 'cur->page' *can* be out-ouf-bounds it cannot be guaranteed that
by chance (or intention of an attacker) it matches the value of 'page'
even though the correct element was not found.

This is fixed by using a separate list iterator variable for the loop
and only setting the original variable if a suitable element was found.
Then determing if the element was found is simply checking if the
variable is set."

Any path that uses pci_dev_lock(), e.g., pci_reset_function(), may
deadlock with sriov_numvfs_store() if the operations occur in the sequence
(1) (2) (3) (4).

Avoid the deadlock by reversing the order in pci_dev_lock() so it acquires
the device lock before the config space access lock, the same as the
sriov_numvfs_store() path.

CVE-2022-49436	2025-02-26T07:01:20.057	2025-02-26T07:01:20.057	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/papr_scm: Fix leaking nvdimm_events_map elements

Right now 'char *' elements allocated for individual 'stat_id' in
'papr_scm_priv.nvdimm_events_map[]' during papr_scm_pmu_check_events(), get
leaked in papr_scm_remove() and papr_scm_pmu_register(),
papr_scm_pmu_check_events() error paths.

Also individual 'stat_id' arent NULL terminated 'char *' instead they are fixed
8-byte sized identifiers. However papr_scm_pmu_register() assumes it to be a
NULL terminated 'char *' and at other places it assumes it to be a
'papr_scm_perf_stat.stat_id' sized string which is 8-byes in size.

Fix this by allocating the memory for papr_scm_priv.nvdimm_events_map to also
include space for 'stat_id' entries. This is possible since number of available
events/stat_ids are known upfront. This saves some memory and one extra level of
indirection from 'nvdimm_events_map' to 'stat_id'. Also rest of the code
can continue to call 'kfree(papr_scm_priv.nvdimm_events_map)' without needing to
iterate over the array and free up individual elements."

This happens because MSR[RI] is unset when entering RTAS but there is no
valid reason to not set it here.

RTAS is expected to be called with MSR[RI] as specified in PAPR+ section
""7.2.1 Machine State"":

  R1–7.2.1–9. If called with MSR[RI] equal to 1, then RTAS must protect
  its own critical regions from recursion by setting the MSR[RI] bit to
  0 when in the critical regions.

tty: fix deadlock caused by calling printk() under tty_port->lock

pty_write() invokes kmalloc() which may invoke a normal printk() to print
failure message.  This can cause a deadlock in the scenario reported by
syz-bot below:

       CPU0              CPU1                    CPU2
       ----              ----                    ----

                                                 lock(&port_lock_key);
  lock(&port->lock);
                         lock(&port_lock_key);
                                                 lock(&port->lock);
  lock(console_owner);

As commit dbdda842fe96 (""printk: Add console owner and waiter logic to
load balance console writes"") said, such deadlock can be prevented by
using printk_deferred() in kmalloc() (which is invoked in the section
guarded by the port->lock).  But there are too many printk() on the
kmalloc() path, and kmalloc() can be called from anywhere, so changing
printk() to printk_deferred() is too complicated and inelegant.

Therefore, this patch chooses to specify __GFP_NOWARN to kmalloc(), so
that printk() will not be called, and this deadlock problem can be
avoided.

multiple simultaneous ops callers, and preventing activate_show() from
racing activate_store(). For the first 2, the lock is redundant.
Unregistration already flushes all ops users, and sysfs already prevents
multiple threads to be active in an ops handler at the same time. For
the last userspace should already be waiting for its last
activate_store() to complete, and does not need activate_show() to flush
the write side, so this lock usage can be deleted in these attributes."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

rxrpc: Fix listen() setting the bar too high for the prealloc rings

AF_RXRPC's listen() handler lets you set the backlog up to 32 (if you bump
up the sysctl), but whilst the preallocation circular buffers have 32 slots
in them, one of them has to be a dead slot because we're using CIRC_CNT().

This means that listen(rxrpc_sock, 32) will cause an oops when the socket
is closed because rxrpc_service_prealloc_one() allocated one too many calls
and rxrpc_discard_prealloc() won't then be able to get rid of them because
it'll think the ring is empty.  rxrpc_release_calls_on_socket() then tries
to abort them, but oopses because call->peer isn't yet set.

Fix this by setting the maximum backlog to RXRPC_BACKLOG_MAX - 1 to match
the ring capacity.

- Fixed some spelling mistakes in commit message

before substream is being null checked with the macro PCM_RUNTIME_CHECK.
Although PCM_RUNTIME_CHECK calls BUG_ON, it still is useful to perform the
the pointer check before card is assigned."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

usbnet: Run unregister_netdev() before unbind() again

Commit 2c9d6c2b871d (""usbnet: run unbind() before unregister_netdev()"")
sought to fix a use-after-free on disconnect of USB Ethernet adapters.

It turns out that a different fix is necessary to address the issue:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/18b3541e5372bc9b9fc733d422f4e698c089077c.1650177997.git.lukas@wunner.de/

So the commit was not necessary.

The commit made binding and unbinding of USB Ethernet asymmetrical:
Before, usbnet_probe() first invoked the ->bind() callback and then
register_netdev().  usbnet_disconnect() mirrored that by first invoking
unregister_netdev() and then ->unbind().

Since the commit, the order in usbnet_disconnect() is reversed and no
longer mirrors usbnet_probe().

One consequence is that a PHY disconnected (and stopped) in ->unbind()
is afterwards stopped once more by unregister_netdev() as it closes the
netdev before unregistering.  That necessitates a contortion in ->stop()
because the PHY may only be stopped if it hasn't already been
disconnected.

Reverting the commit allows making the call to phy_stop() unconditional
in ->stop()."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

After running a short external loopback test, when the external loopback is
removed and a normal cable inserted that is directly connected to a target
device, the system oops in the llpfc_set_rrq_active() routine.

When the loopback was inserted an FLOGI was transmit. As we're looped back,
we receive the FLOGI request. The FLOGI is ABTS'd as we recognize the same
wppn thus understand it's a loopback. However, as the ABTS sends address
information the port is not set to (fffffe), the ABTS is dropped on the
wire. A short 1 frame loopback test is run and completes before the ABTS
times out. The looback is unplugged and the new cable plugged in, and the
an FLOGI to the new device occurs and completes. Due to a mixup in ref
counting the completion of the new FLOGI releases the fabric ndlp. Then the
original ABTS completes and references the released ndlp generating the
oops.

Correct by no-op'ing the ABTS when in loopback mode (it will be dropped
anyway). Added a flag to track the mode to recognize when it should be
no-op'd."

re-initializing the same &page->lru in fb_deferred_io_fault(), which is
not protected by the lock.

This fix is to init all the page lists one time during initialization,
it not only fixes the list corruption, but also avoids INIT_LIST_HEAD()
redundantly.

Confusingly it also handles other types of controls, but the payload

Fix the code to count the non bytes controls and instead of storing a

In case of non bytes controls we store the pointer to the chanv itself,

ath10k: skip ath10k_halt during suspend for driver state RESTARTING

Double free crash is observed when FW recovery(caused by wmi
timeout/crash) is followed by immediate suspend event. The FW recovery
is triggered by ath10k_core_restart() which calls driver clean up via
ath10k_halt(). When the suspend event occurs between the FW recovery,
the restart worker thread is put into frozen state until suspend completes.
The suspend event triggers ath10k_stop() which again triggers ath10k_halt()
The double invocation of ath10k_halt() causes ath10k_htt_rx_free() to be
called twice(Note: ath10k_htt_rx_alloc was not called by restart worker
thread because of its frozen state), causing the crash.

To fix this, during the suspend flow, skip call to ath10k_halt() in
ath10k_stop() when the current driver state is ATH10K_STATE_RESTARTING.
Also, for driver state ATH10K_STATE_RESTARTING, call
ath10k_wait_for_suspend() in ath10k_stop(). This is because call to
ath10k_wait_for_suspend() is skipped later in
[ath10k_halt() > ath10k_core_stop()] for the driver state
ATH10K_STATE_RESTARTING.

The frozen restart worker thread will be cancelled during resume when the
device comes out of suspend.

CVE-2022-49520	2025-02-26T07:01:28.017	2025-02-26T07:01:28.017	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: compat: Do not treat syscall number as ESR_ELx for a bad syscall

If a compat process tries to execute an unknown system call above the
__ARM_NR_COMPAT_END number, the kernel sends a SIGILL signal to the
offending process. Information about the error is printed to dmesg in
compat_arm_syscall() -> arm64_notify_die() -> arm64_force_sig_fault() ->
arm64_show_signal().

arm64_show_signal() interprets a non-zero value for
current->thread.fault_code as an exception syndrome and displays the
message associated with the ESR_ELx.EC field (bits 31:26).
current->thread.fault_code is set in compat_arm_syscall() ->
arm64_notify_die() with the bad syscall number instead of a valid ESR_ELx
value. This means that the ESR_ELx.EC field has the value that the user set
for the syscall number and the kernel can end up printing bogus exception
messages*. For example, for the syscall number 0x68000000, which evaluates
to ESR_ELx.EC value of 0x1A (ESR_ELx_EC_FPAC) the kernel prints this error:

[   18.349161] syscall[300]: unhandled exception: ERET/ERETAA/ERETAB, ESR 0x68000000, Oops - bad compat syscall(2) in syscall[10000+50000]

[   18.351249] Hardware name: Pine64 RockPro64 v2.0 (DT)
[..]

which is misleading, as the bad compat syscall has nothing to do with
pointer authentication.

Stop arm64_show_signal() from printing exception syndrome information by
having compat_arm_syscall() set the ESR_ELx value to 0, as it has no
meaning for an invalid system call number. The example above now becomes:

[   19.935275] syscall[301]: unhandled exception: Oops - bad compat syscall(2) in syscall[10000+50000]
[   19.936124] CPU: 1 PID: 301 Comm: syscall Not tainted 5.18.0-rc1-00005-g7e08006d4102 #80
[   19.936894] Hardware name: Pine64 RockPro64 v2.0 (DT)
[..]

which although shows less information because the syscall number,
wrongfully advertised as the ESR value, is missing, it is better than
showing plainly wrong information. The syscall number can be easily
obtained with strace.

*A 32-bit value above or equal to 0x8000_0000 is interpreted as a negative
integer in compat_arm_syscal() and the condition scno < __ARM_NR_COMPAT_END
evaluates to true; the syscall will exit to userspace in this case with the
ENOSYS error code instead of arm64_notify_die() being called."

CVE-2022-49526	2025-02-26T07:01:28.593	2025-02-26T07:01:28.593	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md/bitmap: don't set sb values if can't pass sanity check

If bitmap area contains invalid data, kernel will crash then mdadm
triggers ""Segmentation fault"".
This is cluster-md speical bug. In non-clustered env, mdadm will
handle broken metadata case. In clustered array, only kernel space
handles bitmap slot info. But even this bug only happened in clustered
env, current sanity check is wrong, the code should be changed.

How to trigger: (faulty injection)

dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1 oflag=direct of=/dev/sda
dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1 oflag=direct of=/dev/sdb
mdadm -C /dev/md0 -b clustered -e 1.2 -n 2 -l mirror /dev/sda /dev/sdb
mdadm -Ss
echo aaa > magic.txt
 == below modifying slot 2 bitmap data ==
dd if=magic.txt of=/dev/sda seek=16384 bs=1 count=3 <== destroy magic
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda seek=16436 bs=1 count=4 <== ZERO chunksize
mdadm -A /dev/md0 /dev/sda /dev/sdb
 == kernel crashes. mdadm outputs ""Segmentation fault"" ==

Reason of kernel crash:

In md_bitmap_read_sb (called by md_bitmap_create), bad bitmap magic didn't
block chunksize assignment, and zero value made DIV_ROUND_UP_SECTOR_T()
trigger ""divide error"".

drm/amd/pm: fix double free in si_parse_power_table()

In function si_parse_power_table(), array adev->pm.dpm.ps and its member
is allocated. If the allocation of each member fails, the array itself
is freed and returned with an error code. However, the array is later
freed again in si_dpm_fini() function which is called when the function
returns an error.

This leads to potential double free of the array adev->pm.dpm.ps, as
well as leak of its array members, since the members are not freed in
the allocation function and the array is not nulled when freed.
In addition adev->pm.dpm.num_ps, which keeps track of the allocated
array member, is not updated until the member allocation is
successfully finished, this could also lead to either use after free,
or uninitialized variable access in si_dpm_fini().

Fix this by postponing the free of the array until si_dpm_fini() and

ath11k: Change max no of active probe SSID and BSSID to fw capability

The maximum number of SSIDs in a for active probe requests is currently
reported as 16 (WLAN_SCAN_PARAMS_MAX_SSID) when registering the driver.
The scan_req_params structure only has the capacity to hold 10 SSIDs.
This leads to a buffer overflow which can be triggered from
wpa_supplicant in userspace. When copying the SSIDs into the
scan_req_params structure in the ath11k_mac_op_hw_scan route, it can
overwrite the extraie pointer.

Firmware supports 16 ssid * 4 bssid, for each ssid 4 bssid combo probe
request will be sent, so totally 64 probe requests supported. So
set both max ssid and bssid to 16 and 4 respectively. Remove the
redundant macros of ssid and bssid.

scsi: lpfc: Fix null pointer dereference after failing to issue FLOGI and PLOGI

If lpfc_issue_els_flogi() fails and returns non-zero status, the node

structure. However, if there is a prior registration or dev-loss-evt work
pending, the node may be released prematurely.  When dev-loss-evt
completes, the released node is referenced causing a use-after-free null
pointer dereference.

Similarly, when processing non-zero ELS PLOGI completion status in
lpfc_cmpl_els_plogi(), the ndlp flags are checked for a transport
registration before triggering node removal.  If dev-loss-evt work is
pending, the node may be released prematurely and a subsequent call to
lpfc_dev_loss_tmo_handler() results in a use after free ndlp dereference.

The CAM, meaning address CAM and bssid CAM here, will get leaks during
SER (system error recover) L2 reset process and ieee80211_restart_hw()

The normal flow would be like
-> add interface (acquire 1)

-> leave ips (acquire 1)
-> connection (occupy 1) <(A) 1 leak after L2 reset if non-sec connection>

-> ieee80211 reconfig

Originally, CAM is released before HW restart only if connection is under
security. Now, release CAM whatever connection it is to fix leak in (A).
OTOH, check if CAM is already valid to avoid acquiring multiple times to
fix (B).

Besides, if AP mode, release address CAM of all stations before HW restart."

This commit therefore fixes this issue by applying a single-CPU
optimization to the RCU Tasks Rude grace-period process.  The key point
here is that the purpose of this RCU flavor is to force a schedule on
each online CPU since some past event.  But the rcu_tasks_rude_wait_gp()
function runs in the context of the RCU Tasks Rude's grace-period kthread,
so there must already have been a context switch on the current CPU since
the call to either synchronize_rcu_tasks_rude() or call_rcu_tasks_rude().
So if there is only a single CPU online, RCU Tasks Rude's grace-period
kthread does not need to anything at all.

It turns out that the rcu_tasks_rude_wait_gp() function's call to
schedule_on_each_cpu() causes problems during early boot.  During that
time, there is only one online CPU, namely the boot CPU.  Therefore,
applying this single-CPU optimization fixes early-boot instances of
this problem."

Reason is mhi_deassert_dev_wake() from mhi_device_put() is called
but mhi_assert_dev_wake() from __mhi_device_get_sync() is not called
in progress of recovery. Commit 8e0559921f9a (""bus: mhi: core:
Skip device wake in error or shutdown state"") add check for the
pm_state of mhi in __mhi_device_get_sync(), and the pm_state is not
the normal state untill recovery is completed, so it leads the
dev_wake is not 0 and above warning print in mhi_pm_disable_transition()
while checking mhi_cntrl->dev_wake.

Add check in ath11k_pci_write32()/ath11k_pci_read32() to skip call
mhi_device_put() if mhi_device_get_sync() does not really do wake,
then the warning gone.

In crash_prepare_elf64_headers(), a buffer is allocated via vmalloc() to
store elf headers.  While it's not freed back to system correctly when
kdump kernel is reloaded or unloaded.  Then memory leak is caused.  Fix it
by introducing x86 specific function arch_kimage_file_post_load_cleanup(),
and freeing the buffer there.

And also remove the incorrect elf header buffer freeing code.  Before
calling arch specific kexec_file loading function, the image instance has
been initialized.  So 'image->elf_headers' must be NULL.  It doesn't make
sense to free the elf header buffer in the place.

CVE-2022-49547	2025-02-26T07:01:30.590	2025-10-01T20:16:41.473	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix deadlock between concurrent dio writes when low on free data space

When reserving data space for a direct IO write we can end up deadlocking
if we have multiple tasks attempting a write to the same file range, there
are multiple extents covered by that file range, we are low on available
space for data and the writes don't expand the inode's i_size.

The deadlock can happen like this:

1) We have a file with an i_size of 1M, at offset 0 it has an extent with
   a size of 128K and at offset 128K it has another extent also with a
   size of 128K;

2) Task A does a direct IO write against file range [0, 256K), and because
   the write is within the i_size boundary, it takes the inode's lock (VFS
   level) in shared mode;

3) Task A locks the file range [0, 256K) at btrfs_dio_iomap_begin(), and
   then gets the extent map for the extent covering the range [0, 128K).
   At btrfs_get_blocks_direct_write(), it creates an ordered extent for
   that file range ([0, 128K));

4) Before returning from btrfs_dio_iomap_begin(), it unlocks the file
   range [0, 256K);

5) Task A executes btrfs_dio_iomap_begin() again, this time for the file
   range [128K, 256K), and locks the file range [128K, 256K);

6) Task B starts a direct IO write against file range [0, 256K) as well.
   It also locks the inode in shared mode, as it's within the i_size limit,
   and then tries to lock file range [0, 256K). It is able to lock the
   subrange [0, 128K) but then blocks waiting for the range [128K, 256K),
   as it is currently locked by task A;

7) Task A enters btrfs_get_blocks_direct_write() and tries to reserve data
   space. Because we are low on available free space, it triggers the
   async data reclaim task, and waits for it to reserve data space;

8) The async reclaim task decides to wait for all existing ordered extents
   to complete (through btrfs_wait_ordered_roots()).
   It finds the ordered extent previously created by task A for the file
   range [0, 128K) and waits for it to complete;

9) The ordered extent for the file range [0, 128K) can not complete
   because it blocks at btrfs_finish_ordered_io() when trying to lock the
   file range [0, 128K).

   This results in a deadlock, because:

   - task B is holding the file range [0, 128K) locked, waiting for the
     range [128K, 256K) to be unlocked by task A;

   - task A is holding the file range [128K, 256K) locked and it's waiting
     for the async data reclaim task to satisfy its space reservation
     request;

   - the async data reclaim task is waiting for ordered extent [0, 128K)
     to complete, but the ordered extent can not complete because the
     file range [0, 128K) is currently locked by task B, which is waiting
     on task A to unlock file range [128K, 256K) and task A waiting
     on the async data reclaim task.

   This results in a deadlock between 4 task: task A, task B, the async
   data reclaim task and the task doing ordered extent completion (a work
   queue task).

This type of deadlock can sporadically be triggered by the test case
generic/300 from fstests, and results in a stack trace like the following:

Fix this by putting an empty assignment to the [HC_FIELD_MAX]

CVE-2022-49559	2025-02-26T07:01:31.687	2025-02-26T07:01:31.687	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86: Drop WARNs that assert a triple fault never ""escapes"" from L2

Remove WARNs that sanity check that KVM never lets a triple fault for L2
escape and incorrectly end up in L1.  In normal operation, the sanity
check is perfectly valid, but it incorrectly assumes that it's impossible
for userspace to induce KVM_REQ_TRIPLE_FAULT without bouncing through
KVM_RUN (which guarantees kvm_check_nested_state() will see and handle
the triple fault).

The WARN can currently be triggered if userspace injects a machine check
while L2 is active and CR4.MCE=0.  And a future fix to allow save/restore
of KVM_REQ_TRIPLE_FAULT, e.g. so that a synthesized triple fault isn't
lost on migration, will make it trivially easy for userspace to trigger
the WARN.

Clearing KVM_REQ_TRIPLE_FAULT when forcibly leaving guest mode is
tempting, but wrong, especially if/when the request is saved/restored,
e.g. if userspace restores events (including a triple fault) and then
restores nested state (which may forcibly leave guest mode).  Ignoring
the fact that KVM doesn't currently provide the necessary APIs, it's
userspace's responsibility to manage pending events during save/restore.

Most KVM devices use 1) but Book3s's interrupt controller KVM devices

igc: Reinstate IGC_REMOVED logic and implement it properly

The initially merged version of the igc driver code (via commit
146740f9abc4, ""igc: Add support for PF"") contained the following
IGC_REMOVED checks in the igc_rd32/wr32() MMIO accessors:

	u32 igc_rd32(struct igc_hw *hw, u32 reg)
	{
		u8 __iomem *hw_addr = READ_ONCE(hw->hw_addr);
		u32 value = 0;

		if (IGC_REMOVED(hw_addr))
			return ~value;

		value = readl(&hw_addr[reg]);

		/* reads should not return all F's */
		if (!(~value) && (!reg || !(~readl(hw_addr))))
			hw->hw_addr = NULL;

		return value;
	}

And:

	#define wr32(reg, val) \
	do { \
		u8 __iomem *hw_addr = READ_ONCE((hw)->hw_addr); \
		if (!IGC_REMOVED(hw_addr)) \
			writel((val), &hw_addr[(reg)]); \
	} while (0)

E.g. igb has similar checks in its MMIO accessors, and has a similar
macro E1000_REMOVED, which is implemented as follows:

	#define E1000_REMOVED(h) unlikely(!(h))

These checks serve to detect and take note of an 0xffffffff MMIO read
return from the device, which can be caused by a PCIe link flap or some
other kind of PCI bus error, and to avoid performing MMIO reads and
writes from that point onwards.

However, the IGC_REMOVED macro was not originally implemented:

	#ifndef IGC_REMOVED
	#define IGC_REMOVED(a) (0)
	#endif /* IGC_REMOVED */

This led to the IGC_REMOVED logic to be removed entirely in a
subsequent commit (commit 3c215fb18e70, ""igc: remove IGC_REMOVED
function""), with the rationale that such checks matter only for
virtualization and that igc does not support virtualization -- but a
PCIe device can become detached even without virtualization being in
use, and without proper checks, a PCIe bus error affecting an igc
adapter will lead to various NULL pointer dereferences, as the first
access after the error will set hw->hw_addr to NULL, and subsequent
accesses will blindly dereference this now-NULL pointer.

This patch reinstates the IGC_REMOVED checks in igc_rd32/wr32(), and
implements IGC_REMOVED the way it is done for igb, by checking for the
unlikely() case of hw_addr being NULL.  This change prevents the oopses
seen when a PCIe link flap occurs on an igc adapter."

						    ring_buffer_attach(e1, e2->rb)

After this; e1 is attached to an unmapped rb and a subsequent
perf_mmap() will loop forever more:

	again:
		mutex_lock(&e->mmap_mutex);
		if (event->rb) {
			...
			if (!atomic_inc_not_zero(&e->rb->mmap_count)) {
				...
				mutex_unlock(&e->mmap_mutex);
				goto again;
			}
		}

The loop in perf_mmap_close() holds e2->mmap_mutex, while the attach
in perf_event_set_output() holds e1->mmap_mutex. As such there is no
serialization to avoid this race.

Change perf_event_set_output() to take both e1->mmap_mutex and
e2->mmap_mutex to alleviate that problem. Additionally, have the loop
in perf_mmap() detach the rb directly, this avoids having to wait for
the concurrent perf_mmap_close() to get around to doing it to make
progress."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

The change was introduced in a4585ba2050f460f749bbaf2b67bd56c41e30283
(""power: supply: core: Use library interpolation"").
There are two issues: First, the lines ""high = i - 1"" and ""high = i"" in ocv2cap
have the wrong order compared to temp2resist. As a consequence, ocv2cap
sets high=-1 if ocv>table[0].ocv, which causes an out-of-bounds read.
Second, the logic of temp2resist is also not correct.
Consider the case table[] = {{20, 100}, {10, 80}, {0, 60}}.

net: stmmac: dwc-qos: Disable split header for Tegra194

There is a long-standing issue with the Synopsys DWC Ethernet driver
for Tegra194 where random system crashes have been observed [0]. The
problem occurs when the split header feature is enabled in the stmmac
driver. In the bad case, a larger than expected buffer length is
received and causes the calculation of the total buffer length to
overflow. This results in a very large buffer length that causes the
kernel to crash. Why this larger buffer length is received is not clear,
however, the feedback from the NVIDIA design team is that the split
header feature is not supported for Tegra194. Therefore, disable split
header support for Tegra194 to prevent these random crashes from
occurring.

cgroup: Use separate src/dst nodes when preloading css_sets for migration

Each cset (css_set) is pinned by its tasks. When we're moving tasks around
across csets for a migration, we need to hold the source and destination
csets to ensure that they don't go away while we're moving tasks about. This
is done by linking cset->mg_preload_node on either the
mgctx->preloaded_src_csets or mgctx->preloaded_dst_csets list. Using the
same cset->mg_preload_node for both the src and dst lists was deemed okay as
a cset can't be both the source and destination at the same time.

Unfortunately, this overloading becomes problematic when multiple tasks are
involved in a migration and some of them are identity noop migrations while
others are actually moving across cgroups. For example, this can happen with
the following sequence on cgroup1:

 #1> mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/misc/a/b
 #2> echo $$ > /sys/fs/cgroup/misc/a/cgroup.procs
 #3> RUN_A_COMMAND_WHICH_CREATES_MULTIPLE_THREADS &
 #4> PID=$!
 #5> echo $PID > /sys/fs/cgroup/misc/a/b/tasks
 #6> echo $PID > /sys/fs/cgroup/misc/a/cgroup.procs

the process including the group leader back into a. In this final migration,
non-leader threads would be doing identity migration while the group leader
is doing an actual one.

After #3, let's say the whole process was in cset A, and that after #4, the
leader moves to cset B. Then, during #6, the following happens:

 1. cgroup_migrate_add_src() is called on B for the leader.

 2. cgroup_migrate_add_src() is called on A for the other threads.

 3. cgroup_migrate_prepare_dst() is called. It scans the src list.

 4. It notices that B wants to migrate to A, so it tries to A to the dst
    list but realizes that its ->mg_preload_node is already busy.

 5. and then it notices A wants to migrate to A as it's an identity
    migration, it culls it by list_del_init()'ing its ->mg_preload_node and
    putting references accordingly.

 6. The rest of migration takes place with B on the src list but nothing on
    the dst list.

This means that A isn't held while migration is in progress. If all tasks
leave A before the migration finishes and the incoming task pins it, the
cset will be destroyed leading to use-after-free.

This is caused by overloading cset->mg_preload_node for both src and dst
preload lists. We wanted to exclude the cset from the src list but ended up
inadvertently excluding it from the dst list too.

This patch fixes the issue by separating out cset->mg_preload_node into
->mg_src_preload_node and ->mg_dst_preload_node, so that the src and dst
preloadings don't interfere with each other."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

tracing/histograms: Fix memory leak problem

This reverts commit 46bbe5c671e06f070428b9be142cc4ee5cedebac.

As commit 46bbe5c671e0 (""tracing: fix double free"") said, the
""double free"" problem reported by clang static analyzer is:
  > In parse_var_defs() if there is a problem allocating
  > var_defs.expr, the earlier var_defs.name is freed.
  > This free is duplicated by free_var_defs() which frees
  > the rest of the list.

However, if there is a problem allocating N-th var_defs.expr:
  + in parse_var_defs(), the freed 'earlier var_defs.name' is
    actually the N-th var_defs.name;
  + then in free_var_defs(), the names from 0th to (N-1)-th are freed;

                        IF ALLOCATING PROBLEM HAPPENED HERE!!! -+
                                                                 \

These two frees don't act on same name, so there was no ""double free""
problem before. Conversely, after that commit, we get a ""memory leak""
problem because the above ""N-th var_defs.name"" is not freed.

If enable CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK and inject a fault at where the N-th
var_defs.expr allocated, then execute on shell like:

bpf: Fix insufficient bounds propagation from adjust_scalar_min_max_vals

Kuee reported a corner case where the tnum becomes constant after the call
to __reg_bound_offset(), but the register's bounds are not, that is, its
min bounds are still not equal to the register's max bounds.

This in turn allows to leak pointers through turning a pointer register as
is into an unknown scalar via adjust_ptr_min_max_vals().

What can be seen here is that R3=scalar(umin=32767,umax=32768,var_off=(0x7fff;
0x8000)) after the operation R3 += -32767 results in a 'malformed' constant, that
is, R3_w=scalar(imm=0,umax=1,var_off=(0x0; 0x0)). Intersecting with var_off has
not been done at that point via __update_reg_bounds(), which would have improved
the umax to be equal to umin.

Refactor the tnum <> min/max bounds information flow into a reg_bounds_sync()
helper and use it consistently everywhere. After the fix, bounds have been
corrected to R3_w=scalar(imm=0,umax=0,var_off=(0x0; 0x0)) and thus the register
is regarded as a 'proper' constant scalar of 0.

can: gs_usb: gs_usb_open/close(): fix memory leak

The gs_usb driver appears to suffer from a malady common to many USB
CAN adapter drivers in that it performs usb_alloc_coherent() to
allocate a number of USB request blocks (URBs) for RX, and then later
relies on usb_kill_anchored_urbs() to free them, but this doesn't
actually free them. As a result, this may be leaking DMA memory that's
been used by the driver.

This commit is an adaptation of the techniques found in the esd_usb2
driver where a similar design pattern led to a memory leak. It
explicitly frees the RX URBs and their DMA memory via a call to
usb_free_coherent(). Since the RX URBs were allocated in the
gs_can_open(), we remove them in gs_can_close() rather than in the
disconnect function as was done in esd_usb2.

tipc: move bc link creation back to tipc_node_create

Shuang Li reported a NULL pointer dereference crash:

It was caused by the 'l' passed into tipc_bcast_rcv() is NULL. When it
creates a node in tipc_node_check_dest(), after inserting the new node
into hashtable in tipc_node_create(), it creates the bc link. However,
there is a gap between this insert and bc link creation, a bc packet
may come in and get the node from the hashtable then try to dereference
its bc link, which is NULL.

This patch is to fix it by moving the bc link creation before inserting
into the hashtable.

Note that for a preliminary node becoming ""real"", the bc link creation
should also be called before it's rehashed, as we don't create it for
preliminary nodes."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

net: bonding: fix use-after-free after 802.3ad slave unbind

commit 0622cab0341c (""bonding: fix 802.3ad aggregator reselection""),
resolve case, when there is several aggregation groups in the same bond.
bond_3ad_unbind_slave will invalidate (clear) aggregator when
__agg_active_ports return zero. So, ad_clear_agg can be executed even, when
num_of_ports!=0. Than bond_3ad_unbind_slave can be executed again for,
previously cleared aggregator. NOTE: at this time bond_3ad_unbind_slave
will not update slave ports list, because lag_ports==NULL. So, here we
got slave ports, pointing to freed aggregator memory.

Fix with checking actual number of ports in group (as was before
commit 0622cab0341c (""bonding: fix 802.3ad aggregator reselection"") ),
before ad_clear_agg().

dm raid: fix accesses beyond end of raid member array

On dm-raid table load (using raid_ctr), dm-raid allocates an array
rs->devs[rs->raid_disks] for the raid device members. rs->raid_disks
is defined by the number of raid metadata and image tupples passed
into the target's constructor.

In the case of RAID layout changes being requested, that number can be
different from the current number of members for existing raid sets as
defined in their superblocks. Example RAID layout changes include:
- raid1 legs being added/removed
- raid4/5/6/10 number of stripes changed (stripe reshaping)
- takeover to higher raid level (e.g. raid5 -> raid6)

When accessing array members, rs->raid_disks must be used in control
loops instead of the potentially larger value in rs->md.raid_disks.
Otherwise it will cause memory access beyond the end of the rs->devs
array.

Fix this by changing code that is prone to out-of-bounds access.
Also fix validate_raid_redundancy() to validate all devices that are
added. Also, use braces to help clean up raid_iterate_devices().

The out-of-bounds memory accesses was discovered using KASAN.

This happens because virtnet_freeze() frees the receive_queue
completely (including struct xdp_rxq_info) but does not call
xdp_rxq_info_unreg(). Similarly, virtnet_restore() sets up the
receive_queue again but does not call xdp_rxq_info_reg().

Actually, parts of virtnet_freeze_down() and virtnet_restore_up()
are almost identical to virtnet_close() and virtnet_open(): only
the calls to xdp_rxq_info_(un)reg() are missing. This means that
we can fix this easily and avoid such problems in the future by
just calling virtnet_close()/open() from the freeze/restore handlers.

Aside from adding the missing xdp_rxq_info calls the only difference
is that the refill work is only cancelled if netif_running(). However,
this should not make any functional difference since the refill work
should only be active if the network interface is actually up."

afs: Fix dynamic root getattr

The recent patch to make afs_getattr consult the server didn't account
for the pseudo-inodes employed by the dynamic root-type afs superblock
not having a volume or a server to access, and thus an oops occurs if
such a directory is stat'd.

Fix this by checking to see if the vnode->volume pointer actually points
anywhere before following it in afs_getattr().

This can be tested by stat'ing a directory in /afs.  It may be
sufficient just to do ""ls /afs"" and the oops looks something like:

the cancel_work_sync() function just to make sure ONLY the work
tipc_net_finalize_work() is executing/pending on any CPU completed before
tipc namespace is destroyed through tipc_exit_net(). But this function
is not guaranteed the work is the last queued. So, the destroyed instance
may be accessed in the work which will try to enqueue later.

In order to completely fix, we re-order the calling of cancel_work_sync()
to make sure the work tipc_net_finalize_work() was last queued and it
must be completed by calling cancel_work_sync()."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

bpf: Fix request_sock leak in sk lookup helpers

A customer reported a request_socket leak in a Calico cloud environment. We
found that a BPF program was doing a socket lookup with takes a refcnt on
the socket and that it was finding the request_socket but returning the parent
LISTEN socket via sk_to_full_sk() without decrementing the child request socket
1st, resulting in request_sock slab object leak. This patch retains the
existing behaviour of returning full socks to the caller but it also decrements
the child request_socket if one is present before doing so to prevent the leak.

Thanks to Curtis Taylor for all the help in diagnosing and testing this. And
thanks to Antoine Tenart for the reproducer and patch input.

v2 of this patch contains, refactor as per Daniel Borkmann's suggestions to
validate RCU flags on the listen socket so that it balances with bpf_sk_release()
and update comments as per Martin KaFai Lau's suggestion. One small change to
Daniels suggestion, put ""sk = sk2"" under ""if (sk2 != sk)"" to avoid an extra
instruction."

CVE-2022-49700	2025-02-26T07:01:44.740	2025-03-25T13:37:51.227	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/slub: add missing TID updates on slab deactivation

The fastpath in slab_alloc_node() assumes that c->slab is stable as long as
the TID stays the same. However, two places in __slab_alloc() currently
don't update the TID when deactivating the CPU slab.

If multiple operations race the right way, this could lead to an object
getting lost; or, in an even more unlikely situation, it could even lead to
an object being freed onto the wrong slab's freelist, messing up the
`inuse` counter and eventually causing a page to be freed to the page
allocator while it still contains slab objects.

(I haven't actually tested these cases though, this is just based on
looking at the code. Writing testcases for this stuff seems like it'd be
a pain...)

The race leading to state inconsistency is (all operations on the same CPU
and kmem_cache):

 - task A: begin do_slab_free():
    - read TID
    - read pcpu freelist (==NULL)
    - check `slab == c->slab` (true)
 - [PREEMPT A->B]
 - task B: begin slab_alloc_node():
    - fastpath fails (`c->freelist` is NULL)
    - enter __slab_alloc()
    - slub_get_cpu_ptr() (disables preemption)
    - enter ___slab_alloc()
    - take local_lock_irqsave()
    - read c->freelist as NULL
    - get_freelist() returns NULL
    - write `c->slab = NULL`
    - drop local_unlock_irqrestore()
    - goto new_slab
    - slub_percpu_partial() is NULL
    - get_partial() returns NULL
    - slub_put_cpu_ptr() (enables preemption)
 - [PREEMPT B->A]
 - task A: finish do_slab_free():
    - this_cpu_cmpxchg_double() succeeds()
    - [CORRUPT STATE: c->slab==NULL, c->freelist!=NULL]

From there, the object on c->freelist will get lost if task B is allowed to
continue from here: It will proceed to the retry_load_slab label,
set c->slab, then jump to load_freelist, which clobbers c->freelist.

But if we instead continue as follows, we get worse corruption:

 - task A: run __slab_free() on object from other struct slab:
    - CPU_PARTIAL_FREE case (slab was on no list, is now on pcpu partial)
 - task A: run slab_alloc_node() with NUMA node constraint:
    - fastpath fails (c->slab is NULL)
    - call __slab_alloc()
    - slub_get_cpu_ptr() (disables preemption)
    - enter ___slab_alloc()
    - c->slab is NULL: goto new_slab
    - slub_percpu_partial() is non-NULL
    - set c->slab to slub_percpu_partial(c)
    - [CORRUPT STATE: c->slab points to slab-1, c->freelist has objects
      from slab-2]
    - goto redo
    - node_match() fails
    - goto deactivate_slab
    - existing c->freelist is passed into deactivate_slab()
    - inuse count of slab-1 is decremented to account for object from
      slab-2

At this point, the inuse count of slab-1 is 1 lower than it should be.
This means that if we free all allocated objects in slab-1 except for one,
SLUB will think that slab-1 is completely unused, and may free its page,
leading to use-after-free."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

scsi: ibmvfc: Allocate/free queue resource only during probe/remove

Currently, the sub-queues and event pool resources are allocated/freed for
every CRQ connection event such as reset and LPM. This exposes the driver
to a couple issues. First the inefficiency of freeing and reallocating
memory that can simply be resued after being sanitized. Further, a system
under memory pressue runs the risk of allocation failures that could result
in a crippled driver. Finally, there is a race window where command
submission/compeletion can try to pull/return elements from/to an event
pool that is being deleted or already has been deleted due to the lack of
host state around freeing/allocating resources. The following is an example
of list corruption following a live partition migration (LPM):

CVE-2022-49703	2025-02-26T07:01:45.947	2025-10-01T20:17:06.120	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ibmvfc: Store vhost pointer during subcrq allocation

Currently the back pointer from a queue to the vhost adapter isn't set
until after subcrq interrupt registration. The value is available when a
queue is first allocated and can/should be also set for primary and async
queues as well as subcrqs.

This fixes a crash observed during kexec/kdump on Power 9 with legacy XICS
interrupt controller where a pending subcrq interrupt from the previous
kernel can be replayed immediately upon IRQ registration resulting in
dereference of a garbage backpointer in ibmvfc_interrupt_scsi().

the code with this change, zonefs_iomap_begin() is split into the read

CVE-2022-49721	2025-02-26T07:01:47.793	2025-02-26T07:01:47.793	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: ftrace: consistently handle PLTs.

Sometimes it is necessary to use a PLT entry to call an ftrace
trampoline. This is handled by ftrace_make_call() and ftrace_make_nop(),
with each having *almost* identical logic, but this is not handled by
ftrace_modify_call() since its introduction in commit:

  3b23e4991fb66f6d (""arm64: implement ftrace with regs"")

Due to this, if we ever were to call ftrace_modify_call() for a callsite
which requires a PLT entry for a trampoline, then either:

a) If the old addr requires a trampoline, ftrace_modify_call() will use
   an out-of-range address to generate the 'old' branch instruction.
   This will result in warnings from aarch64_insn_gen_branch_imm() and
   ftrace_modify_code(), and no instructions will be modified. As
   ftrace_modify_call() will return an error, this will result in
   subsequent internal ftrace errors.

b) If the old addr does not require a trampoline, but the new addr does,
   ftrace_modify_call() will use an out-of-range address to generate the
   'new' branch instruction. This will result in warnings from
   aarch64_insn_gen_branch_imm(), and ftrace_modify_code() will replace
   the 'old' branch with a BRK. This will result in a kernel panic when
   this BRK is later executed.

Practically speaking, case (a) is vastly more likely than case (b), and
typically this will result in internal ftrace errors that don't
necessarily affect the rest of the system. This can be demonstrated with
an out-of-tree test module which triggers ftrace_modify_call(), e.g.

We can solve this by consistently determining whether to use a PLT entry
for an address.

ice: Fix memory corruption in VF driver

Disable VF's RX/TX queues, when it's disabled. VF can have queues enabled,
when it requests a reset. If PF driver assumes that VF is disabled,
while VF still has queues configured, VF may unmap DMA resources.
In such scenario device still can map packets to memory, which ends up
silently corrupting it.
Previously, VF driver could experience memory corruption, which lead to

CVE-2022-49726	2025-02-26T07:01:48.257	2025-02-26T07:01:48.257	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clocksource: hyper-v: unexport __init-annotated hv_init_clocksource()

EXPORT_SYMBOL and __init is a bad combination because the .init.text
section is freed up after the initialization. Hence, modules cannot
use symbols annotated __init. The access to a freed symbol may end up
with kernel panic.

modpost used to detect it, but it has been broken for a decade.

Recently, I fixed modpost so it started to warn it again, then this
showed up in linux-next builds.

There are two ways to fix it:

  - Remove __init
  - Remove EXPORT_SYMBOL

I chose the latter for this case because the only in-tree call-site,
arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mshyperv.c is never compiled as modular.

sock: redo the psock vs ULP protection check

Commit 8a59f9d1e3d4 (""sock: Introduce sk->sk_prot->psock_update_sk_prot()"")
has moved the inet_csk_has_ulp(sk) check from sk_psock_init() to
the new tcp_bpf_update_proto() function. I'm guessing that this
was done to allow creating psocks for non-inet sockets.

Unfortunately the destruction path for psock includes the ULP
unwind, so we need to fail the sk_psock_init() itself.
Otherwise if ULP is already present we'll notice that later,
and call tcp_update_ulp() with the sk_proto of the ULP
itself, which will most likely result in the ULP looping
its callbacks."

udp: Deal with race between UDP socket address change and rehash

If a UDP socket changes its local address while it's receiving
datagrams, as a result of connect(), there is a period during which
a lookup operation might fail to find it, after the address is changed
but before the secondary hash (port and address) and the four-tuple
hash (local and remote ports and addresses) are updated.

Secondary hash chains were introduced by commit 30fff9231fad (""udp:
bind() optimisation"") and, as a result, a rehash operation became
needed to make a bound socket reachable again after a connect().

This operation was introduced by commit 719f835853a9 (""udp: add
rehash on connect()"") which isn't however a complete fix: the
socket will be found once the rehashing completes, but not while
it's pending.

This is noticeable with a socat(1) server in UDP4-LISTEN mode, and a
client sending datagrams to it. After the server receives the first
datagram (cf. _xioopen_ipdgram_listen()), it issues a connect() to
the address of the sender, in order to set up a directed flow.

Now, if the client, running on a different CPU thread, happens to
send a (subsequent) datagram while the server's socket changes its
address, but is not rehashed yet, this will result in a failed
lookup and a port unreachable error delivered to the client, as
apparent from the following reproducer:

  LEN=$(($(cat /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_default) / 4))
  dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=${LEN} of=tmp.in

  while :; do
  	taskset -c 1 socat UDP4-LISTEN:1337,null-eof OPEN:tmp.out,create,trunc &
  	sleep 0.1 || sleep 1
  	taskset -c 2 socat OPEN:tmp.in UDP4:localhost:1337,shut-null
  	wait
  done

where the client will eventually get ECONNREFUSED on a write()
(typically the second or third one of a given iteration):

  2024/11/13 21:28:23 socat[46901] E write(6, 0x556db2e3c000, 8192): Connection refused

This issue was first observed as a seldom failure in Podman's tests
checking UDP functionality while using pasta(1) to connect the
container's network namespace, which leads us to a reproducer with
the lookup error resulting in an ICMP packet on a tap device:

  LOCAL_ADDR=""$(ip -j -4 addr show|jq -rM '.[] | .addr_info[0] | select(.scope == ""global"").local')""

  while :; do
  	./pasta --config-net -p pasta.pcap -u 1337 socat UDP4-LISTEN:1337,null-eof OPEN:tmp.out,create,trunc &
  	sleep 0.2 || sleep 1
  	socat OPEN:tmp.in UDP4:${LOCAL_ADDR}:1337,shut-null
  	wait
  	cmp tmp.in tmp.out
  done

Once this fails:

  tmp.in tmp.out differ: char 8193, line 29

we can finally have a look at what's going on:

[CAUSE]
The first two lines of extra debug messages show the problem is caused
by the error handling of run_delalloc_nocow().

E.g. we have the following dirtied range (4K blocksize 4K page size):

    0                 16K                  32K
    |//////////////////////////////////////|
    |  Pre-allocated  |

And the range [0, 16K) has a preallocated extent.

- Enter run_delalloc_nocow() for range [0, 16K)
  Which found range [0, 16K) is preallocated, can do the proper NOCOW
  write.

- Enter fallback_to_fow() for range [16K, 32K)
  Since the range [16K, 32K) is not backed by preallocated extent, we
  have to go COW.

- cow_file_range() failed for range [16K, 32K)
  So cow_file_range() will do the clean up by clearing folio dirty,
  unlock the folios.

  Now the folios in range [16K, 32K) is unlocked.

- Enter extent_clear_unlock_delalloc() from run_delalloc_nocow()
  Which is called with PAGE_START_WRITEBACK to start page writeback.
  But folios can only be marked writeback when it's properly locked,
  thus this triggered the VM_BUG_ON_FOLIO().

Furthermore there is another hidden but common bug that
run_delalloc_nocow() is not clearing the folio dirty flags in its error
handling path.
This is the common bug shared between run_delalloc_nocow() and
cow_file_range().

[FIX]
- Clear folio dirty for range [@start, @cur_offset)
  Introduce a helper, cleanup_dirty_folios(), which
  will find and lock the folio in the range, clear the dirty flag and
  start/end the writeback, with the extra handling for the
  @locked_folio.

- Introduce a helper to clear folio dirty, start and end writeback

- Introduce a helper to record the last failed COW range end
  This is to trace which range we should skip, to avoid double
  unlocking.

- Skip the failed COW range for the e

[CAUSE]
That failure is mostly from cow_file_range(), where we can hit -ENOSPC.

Although the -ENOSPC is already a bug related to our space reservation
code, let's just focus on the error handling.

For example, we have the following dirty range [0, 64K) of an inode,
with 4K sector size and 4K page size:

   0        16K        32K       48K       64K
   |///////////////////////////////////////|
   |#######################################|

Where |///| means page are still dirty, and |###| means the extent io
tree has EXTENT_DELALLOC flag.

- Enter extent_writepage() for page 0

- Enter btrfs_run_delalloc_range() for range [0, 64K)

- Enter cow_file_range() for range [0, 64K)

- Function btrfs_reserve_extent() only reserved one 16K extent
  So we created extent map and ordered extent for range [0, 16K)

   0        16K        32K       48K       64K
   |////////|//////////////////////////////|
   |<- OE ->|##############################|

   And range [0, 16K) has its delalloc flag cleared.
   But since we haven't yet submit any bio, involved 4 pages are still
   dirty.

- Function btrfs_reserve_extent() returns with -ENOSPC
  Now we have to run error cleanup, which will clear all
  EXTENT_DELALLOC* flags and clear the dirty flags for the remaining
  ranges:

   0        16K        32K       48K       64K
   |////////|                              |
   |        |                              |

  Note that range [0, 16K) still has its pages dirty.

- Some time later, writeback is triggered again for the range [0, 16K)
  since the page range still has dirty flags.

- btrfs_run_delalloc_range() will do nothing because there is no
  EXTENT_DELALLOC flag.

- extent_writepage_io() finds page 0 has no ordered flag
  Which falls into the COW fixup path, triggering the BUG_ON().

Unfortunately this error handling bug dates back to the introduction of
btrfs.  Thankfully with the abuse of COW fixup, at least it won't crash
the kernel.

[FIX]
Instead of immediately unlocking the extent and folios, we keep the extent
and folios locked until either erroring out or the whole delalloc range
finished.

When the whole delalloc range finished without error, we just unlock the
whole range with PAGE_SET_ORDERED (and PAGE_UNLOCK for !keep_locked
cases)

    kernel BUG at lib/list_debug.c:62!
    Kernel panic - not syncing: Oops - BUG: Fatal exception

This happens because pps_device_destruct() frees the pps_device with the
embedded cdev immediately after calling cdev_del(), but, as the comment
above cdev_del() notes, fops for previously opened cdevs are still
callable even after cdev_del() returns. I think this bug has always
been there: I can't explain why it suddenly started happening every time
I reboot this particular board.

In commit d953e0e837e6 (""pps: Fix a use-after free bug when
unregistering a source.""), George Spelvin suggested removing the
embedded cdev. That seems like the simplest way to fix this, so I've
implemented his suggestion, using __register_chrdev() with pps_idr
becoming the source of truth for which minor corresponds to which
device.

But now that pps_idr defines userspace visibility instead of cdev_add(),
we need to be sure the pps->dev refcount can't reach zero while
userspace can still find it again. So, the idr_remove() call moves to
pps_unregister_cdev(), and pps_idr now holds a reference to pps->dev.

the ring pointers unequal and assumes that there is a pending command,

xfrm: state: fix out-of-bounds read during lookup

lookup and resize can run in parallel.

The xfrm_state_hash_generation seqlock ensures a retry, but the hash
functions can observe a hmask value that is too large for the new hlist
array.

rehash does:
  rcu_assign_pointer(net->xfrm.state_bydst, ndst) [..]
  net->xfrm.state_hmask = nhashmask;

While state lookup does:
  h = xfrm_dst_hash(net, daddr, saddr, tmpl->reqid, encap_family);
  hlist_for_each_entry_rcu(x, net->xfrm.state_bydst + h, bydst) {

This is only safe in case the update to state_bydst is larger than
net->xfrm.xfrm_state_hmask (or if the lookup function gets
serialized via state spinlock again).

Fix this by prefetching state_hmask and the associated pointers.
The xfrm_state_hash_generation seqlock retry will ensure that the pointer
and the hmask will be consistent.

The existing helpers, like xfrm_dst_hash(), are now unsafe for RCU side,
add lockdep assertions to document that they are only safe for insert
side.

xfrm_state_lookup_byaddr() uses the spinlock rather than RCU.

HID: core: Fix assumption that Resolution Multipliers must be in Logical Collections

A report in 2019 by the syzbot fuzzer was found to be connected to two
errors in the HID core associated with Resolution Multipliers.  One of
the errors was fixed by commit ea427a222d8b (""HID: core: Fix deadloop
in hid_apply_multiplier.""), but the other has not been fixed.

This error arises because hid_apply_multipler() assumes that every
Resolution Multiplier control is contained in a Logical Collection,
i.e., there's no way the routine can ever set multiplier_collection to
NULL.  This is in spite of the fact that the function starts with a
big comment saying:

	 * ""The Resolution Multiplier control must be contained in the same
	 * Logical Collection as the control(s) to which it is to be applied.
	   ...
	 *  If no Logical Collection is
	 * defined, the Resolution Multiplier is associated with all
	 * controls in the report.""
	 * HID Usage Table, v1.12, Section 4.3.1, p30
	 *
	 * Thus, search from the current collection upwards until we find a
	 * logical collection...

The comment and the code overlook the possibility that none of the
collections found may be a Logical Collection.

The fix is to set the multiplier_collection pointer to NULL if the
collection found isn't a Logical Collection."

wifi: ath12k: fix read pointer after free in ath12k_mac_assign_vif_to_vdev()

In ath12k_mac_assign_vif_to_vdev(), if arvif is created on a different
radio, it gets deleted from that radio through a call to
ath12k_mac_unassign_link_vif(). This action frees the arvif pointer.
Subsequently, there is a check involving arvif, which will result in a
read-after-free scenario.

Fix this by moving this check after arvif is again assigned via call to
ath12k_mac_assign_link_vif().

The crash can be also be reproduced with the following (with a tc
recompiled to allow for sfq limits of 1):

tc qdisc add dev dummy0 handle 1: root tbf rate 1Kbit burst 100b lat 1s
../iproute2-6.9.0/tc/tc qdisc add dev dummy0 handle 2: parent 1:10 sfq limit 1
ifconfig dummy0 up
ping -I dummy0 -f -c2 -W0.1 8.8.8.8
sleep 1

Scenario that triggers the crash:

* the first packet is sent and queued in TBF and SFQ; qdisc qlen is 1

* TBF dequeues: it peeks from SFQ which moves the packet to the
  gso_skb list and keeps qdisc qlen set to 1. TBF is out of tokens so
  it schedules itself for later.

* the second packet is sent and TBF tries to queues it to SFQ. qdisc
  qlen is now 2 and because the SFQ limit is 1 the packet is dropped
  by SFQ. At this point qlen is 1, and all of the SFQ slots are empty,
  however q->tail is not NULL.

At this point, assuming no more packets are queued, when sch_dequeue
runs again it will decrement the qlen for the current empty slot
causing an underflow and the subsequent out of bounds access."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

With the in-kernel path-manager, it is possible to change the 'fullmesh'

mptcp: consolidate suboption status

MPTCP maintains the received sub-options status is the bitmask carrying

CVE-2025-21709	2025-02-27T02:15:14.560	2025-02-27T02:15:14.560	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

kernel: be more careful about dup_mmap() failures and uprobe registering

If a memory allocation fails during dup_mmap(), the maple tree can be left
in an unsafe state for other iterators besides the exit path.  All the
locks are dropped before the exit_mmap() call (in mm/mmap.c), but the
incomplete mm_struct can be reached through (at least) the rmap finding
the vmas which have a pointer back to the mm_struct.

Up to this point, there have been no issues with being able to find an
mm_struct that was only partially initialised.  Syzbot was able to make
the incomplete mm_struct fail with recent forking changes, so it has been
proven unsafe to use the mm_struct that hasn't been initialised, as
referenced in the link below.

Although 8ac662f5da19f (""fork: avoid inappropriate uprobe access to
invalid mm"") fixed the uprobe access, it does not completely remove the
race.

This patch sets the MMF_OOM_SKIP to avoid the iteration of the vmas on the
oom side (even though this is extremely unlikely to be selected as an oom
victim in the race window), and sets MMF_UNSTABLE to avoid other potential
users from using a partially initialised mm_struct.

When registering vmas for uprobe, skip the vmas in an mm that is marked
unstable.  Modifying a vma in an unstable mm may cause issues if the mm
isn't fully initialised."					
CVE-2025-21710	2025-02-27T02:15:14.657	2025-02-27T02:15:14.657	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: correct handling of extreme memory squeeze

Testing with iperf3 using the ""pasta"" protocol splicer has revealed
a problem in the way tcp handles window advertising in extreme memory
squeeze situations.

Under memory pressure, a socket endpoint may temporarily advertise
a zero-sized window, but this is not stored as part of the socket data.
The reasoning behind this is that it is considered a temporary setting
which shouldn't influence any further calculations.

However, if we happen to stall at an unfortunate value of the current
window size, the algorithm selecting a new value will consistently fail
to advertise a non-zero window once we have freed up enough memory.
This means that this side's notion of the current window size is
different from the one last advertised to the peer, causing the latter
to not send any data to resolve the sitution.

The problem occurs on the iperf3 server side, and the socket in question
is a completely regular socket with the default settings for the
fedora40 kernel. We do not use SO_PEEK or SO_RCVBUF on the socket.

The following excerpt of a logging session, with own comments added,
shows more in detail what is happening:

CVE-2025-21720	2025-02-27T02:15:15.683	2025-02-27T02:15:15.683	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfrm: delete intermediate secpath entry in packet offload mode

Packets handled by hardware have added secpath as a way to inform XFRM
core code that this path was already handled. That secpath is not needed
at all after policy is checked and it is removed later in the stack.

However, in the case of IP forwarding is enabled (/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward),
that secpath is not removed and packets which already were handled are reentered
to the driver TX path with xfrm_offload set.

The following kernel panic is observed in mlx5 in such case:

CVE-2025-21721	2025-02-27T02:15:15.787	2025-03-13T13:15:50.060	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: handle errors that nilfs_prepare_chunk() may return

Patch series ""nilfs2: fix issues with rename operations"".

This series fixes BUG_ON check failures reported by syzbot around rename
operations, and a minor behavioral issue where the mtime of a child
directory changes when it is renamed instead of moved.


This patch (of 2):

The directory manipulation routines nilfs_set_link() and
nilfs_delete_entry() rewrite the directory entry in the folio/page
previously read by nilfs_find_entry(), so error handling is omitted on the
assumption that nilfs_prepare_chunk(), which prepares the buffer for
rewriting, will always succeed for these.  And if an error is returned, it
triggers the legacy BUG_ON() checks in each routine.

This assumption is wrong, as proven by syzbot: the buffer layer called by
nilfs_prepare_chunk() may call nilfs_get_block() if necessary, which may
fail due to metadata corruption or other reasons.  This has been there all
along, but improved sanity checks and error handling may have made it more
reproducible in fuzzing tests.

Fix this issue by adding missing error paths in nilfs_set_link(),
nilfs_delete_entry(), and their caller nilfs_rename()."

nilfs2: do not force clear folio if buffer is referenced

Patch series ""nilfs2: protect busy buffer heads from being force-cleared"".

This series fixes the buffer head state inconsistency issues reported by
syzbot that occurs when the filesystem is corrupted and falls back to
read-only, and the associated buffer head use-after-free issue.


This patch (of 2):

Syzbot has reported that after nilfs2 detects filesystem corruption and
falls back to read-only, inconsistencies in the buffer state may occur.

One of the inconsistencies is that when nilfs2 calls mark_buffer_dirty()
to set a data or metadata buffer as dirty, but it detects that the buffer
is not in the uptodate state:

CVE-2025-21727	2025-02-27T02:15:16.423	2025-03-24T18:58:02.740	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

padata: fix UAF in padata_reorder

A bug was found when run ltp test:

process_one_work+0x2ec/0x5a0

If 'mdelay(10)' is added before calling 'padata_find_next' in the
'padata_reorder' function, this issue could be reproduced easily with
ltp test (pcrypt_aead01).

This can be explained as bellow:

pcrypt_aead_encrypt
...
padata_do_parallel
refcount_inc(&pd->refcnt); // add refcnt
...
padata_do_serial
padata_reorder // pd
while (1) {
padata_find_next(pd, true); // using pd
queue_work_on
...
padata_serial_worker				crypto_del_alg
padata_put_pd_cnt // sub refcnt
						padata_free_shell
						padata_put_pd(ps->pd);
						// pd is freed
// loop again, but pd is freed
// call padata_find_next, UAF
}

In the padata_reorder function, when it loops in 'while', if the alg is
deleted, the refcnt may be decreased to 0 before entering
'padata_find_next', which leads to UAF.

As mentioned in [1], do_serial is supposed to be called with BHs disabled
and always happen under RCU protection, to address this issue, add
synchronize_rcu() in 'padata_free_shell' wait for all _do_serial calls
to finish.

his patch had some bugs and my patches had some bugs.  Hopefully all our

PCI: dwc: ep: Prevent changing BAR size/flags in pci_epc_set_bar()

In commit 4284c88fff0e (""PCI: designware-ep: Allow pci_epc_set_bar() update
inbound map address"") set_bar() was modified to support dynamically
changing the backing physical address of a BAR that was already configured.

This means that set_bar() can be called twice, without ever calling
clear_bar() (as calling clear_bar() would clear the BAR's PCI address
assigned by the host).

This can only be done if the new BAR size/flags does not differ from the
existing BAR configuration. Add these missing checks.

If we allow set_bar() to set e.g. a new BAR size that differs from the
existing BAR size, the new address translation range will be smaller than
the BAR size already determined by the host, which would mean that a read
past the new BAR size would pass the iATU untranslated, which could allow
the host to read memory not belonging to the new struct pci_epf_bar.

While at it, add comments which clarifies the support for dynamically
changing the physical address of a BAR. (Which was also missing.)"

The firmware used on MSM8916 exposes SOCINFO_VERSION(0, 8), which does not
have support for the serial_num field in the socinfo struct. There is an
existing check to avoid exposing the serial number in that case, but it's
not correct: When checking the item_size returned by SMEM, we need to make
sure the *end* of the serial_num is within bounds, instead of comparing
with the *start* offset. The serial_number currently exposed on MSM8916
devices is just an out of bounds read of whatever comes after the socinfo

Seemingly a more elegant solution would be to swap bt_sock_alloc() and
l2cap_chan_create() calls since they are not interdependent to that moment
but then l2cap_chan_create() adds the soon to be deallocated and still
dummy-initialized channel to the global list accessible by many L2CAP
paths. The channel would be removed from the list in short period of time

changing the order of function calls.

r535_gsp_cmdq_push() waits for the available page in the GSP cmdq
buffer when handling a large RPC request. When it sees at least one
available page in the cmdq, it quits the waiting with the amount of
free buffer pages in the queue.

Unfortunately, it always takes the [write pointer, buf_size) as

nvkm/gsp: correctly advance the read pointer of GSP message queue

A GSP event message consists three parts: message header, RPC header,
message body. GSP calculates the number of pages to write from the
total size of a GSP message. This behavior can be observed from the
movement of the write pointer.

However, nvkm takes only the size of RPC header and message body as
the message size when advancing the read pointer. When handling a
two-page GSP message in the non rollback case, It wrongly takes the
message body of the previous message as the message header of the next
message. As the ""message length"" tends to be zero, in the calculation of
size needs to be copied (0 - size of (message header)), the size needs to
be copied will be ""0xffffffxx"". It also triggers a kernel panic due to a
NULL pointer error.

RDMA/mlx5: Fix a race for an ODP MR which leads to CQE with error

This patch addresses a race condition for an ODP MR that can result in a
CQE with an error on the UMR QP.

During the __mlx5_ib_dereg_mr() flow, the following sequence of calls
occurs:

mlx5_revoke_mr()
 mlx5r_umr_revoke_mr()
 mlx5r_umr_post_send_wait()

At this point, the lkey is freed from the hardware's perspective.

However, concurrently, mlx5_ib_invalidate_range() might be triggered by
another task attempting to invalidate a range for the same freed lkey.

This task will:
 - Acquire the umem_odp->umem_mutex lock.
 - Call mlx5r_umr_update_xlt() on the UMR QP.
 - Since the lkey has already been freed, this can lead to a CQE error,
   causing the UMR QP to enter an error state [1].

To resolve this race condition, the umem_odp->umem_mutex lock is now also
acquired as part of the mlx5_revoke_mr() scope.  Upon successful revoke,
we set umem_odp->private which points to that MR to NULL, preventing any
further invalidation attempts on its lkey.

ceph: fix memory leak in ceph_mds_auth_match()

We now free the temporary target path substring allocation on every

reveliofuzzing reported that a SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND ioctl with out_len

ATA_NOP, and protocol set to ATA_PROT_PIO, can cause ata_pio_sector() to

While a ATA device is supposed to abort a ATA_NOP command, there does seem
to be a bug either in libata-sff or QEMU, where either this status is not

Anyway, that is most likely a separate bug.

Looking at __atapi_pio_bytes(), it already has a safety check to ensure

scsi: ufs: core: Fix use-after free in init error and remove paths

devm_blk_crypto_profile_init() registers a cleanup handler to run when
the associated (platform-) device is being released. For UFS, the
crypto private data and pointers are stored as part of the ufs_hba's
data structure 'struct ufs_hba::crypto_profile'. This structure is
allocated as part of the underlying ufshcd and therefore Scsi_host
allocation.

During driver release or during error handling in ufshcd_pltfrm_init(),
this structure is released as part of ufshcd_dealloc_host() before the
(platform-) device associated with the crypto call above is released.
Once this device is released, the crypto cleanup code will run, using
the just-released 'struct ufs_hba::crypto_profile'. This causes a
use-after-free situation:

In other words, the initialisation code flow is:

  platform-device probe
    ufshcd_pltfrm_init()
      ufshcd_alloc_host()
        scsi_host_alloc()
          allocation of struct ufs_hba
          creation of scsi-host devices
    devm_blk_crypto_profile_init()
      devm registration of cleanup handler using platform-device

and during error handling of ufshcd_pltfrm_init() or during driver
removal:

  ufshcd_dealloc_host()
    scsi_host_put()
      put_device(scsi-host)
        release of struct ufs_hba
  put_device(platform-device)
    crypto cleanup handler

To fix this use-after free, change ufshcd_alloc_host() to register a
devres action to automatically cleanup the underlying SCSI device on
ufshcd destruction, without requiring explicit calls to
ufshcd_dealloc_host(). This way:

    * the crypto profile and all other ufs_hba-owned resources are
      destroyed before SCSI (as they've been registered after)
    * a memleak is plugged in tc-dwc-g210-pci.c remove() as a
      side-effect
    * EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(ufshcd_dealloc_host) can be removed fully as
      it's not needed anymore
    * no future drivers using ufshcd_alloc_host() could ever forget
      adding the cleanup"	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

On iOS devices, the NDP16 header always directly follows NTH16. Rely on

wifi: brcmfmac: fix NULL pointer dereference in brcmf_txfinalize()

On removal of the device or unloading of the kernel module a potential NULL
pointer dereference occurs.

The following sequence deletes the interface:

  brcmf_detach()
    brcmf_remove_interface()
      brcmf_del_if()

Inside the brcmf_del_if() function the drvr->if2bss[ifidx] is updated to
BRCMF_BSSIDX_INVALID (-1) if the bsscfgidx matches.

After brcmf_remove_interface() call the brcmf_proto_detach() function is
called providing the following sequence:

  brcmf_detach()
    brcmf_proto_detach()
      brcmf_proto_msgbuf_detach()

call to brcmf_txfinalize() will result in a NULL pointer dereference inside
brcmf_txfinalize() when trying to update ifp->ndev->stats.tx_errors.

This will only happen if a flowring still has an skb.

Although the NULL pointer dereference has only been seen when trying to
update the tx statistic, all other uses of the ifp pointer have been

net/mlx5: HWS, change error flow on matcher disconnect

Currently, when firmware failure occurs during matcher disconnect flow,
the error flow of the function reconnects the matcher back and returns
an error, which continues running the calling function and eventually
frees the matcher that is being disconnected.
This leads to a case where we have a freed matcher on the matchers list,
which in turn leads to use-after-free and eventual crash.

This patch fixes that by not trying to reconnect the matcher back when
some FW command fails during disconnect.

Note that we're dealing here with FW error. We can't overcome this
problem. This might lead to bad steering state (e.g. wrong connection
between matchers), and will also lead to resource leakage, as it is
the case with any other error handling during resource destruction.

However, the goal here is to allow the driver to continue and not crash
the machine with use-after-free error."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

btrfs: fix use-after-free when attempting to join an aborted transaction

When we are trying to join the current transaction and if it's aborted,
we read its 'aborted' field after unlocking fs_info->trans_lock and
without holding any extra reference count on it. This means that a
concurrent task that is aborting the transaction may free the transaction
before we read its 'aborted' field, leading to a use-after-free.

Fix this by reading the 'aborted' field while holding fs_info->trans_lock
since any freeing task must first acquire that lock and set
fs_info->running_transaction to NULL before freeing the transaction.

btrfs: fix assertion failure when splitting ordered extent after transaction abort

If while we are doing a direct IO write a transaction abort happens, we
mark all existing ordered extents with the BTRFS_ORDERED_IOERR flag (done
at btrfs_destroy_ordered_extents()), and then after that if we enter
btrfs_split_ordered_extent() and the ordered extent has bytes left
(meaning we have a bio that doesn't cover the whole ordered extent, see
details at btrfs_extract_ordered_extent()), we will fail on the following
assertion at btrfs_split_ordered_extent():

   ASSERT(!(flags & ~BTRFS_ORDERED_TYPE_FLAGS));

because the BTRFS_ORDERED_IOERR flag is set and the definition of
BTRFS_ORDERED_TYPE_FLAGS is just the union of all flags that identify the
type of write (regular, nocow, prealloc, compressed, direct IO, encoded).

Fix this by returning an error from btrfs_extract_ordered_extent() if we
find the BTRFS_ORDERED_IOERR flag in the ordered extent. The error will
be the error that resulted in the transaction abort or -EIO if no
transaction abort happened.

clocksource: Use migrate_disable() to avoid calling get_random_u32() in atomic context

The following bug report happened with a PREEMPT_RT kernel:

  BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/spinlock_rt.c:48
  in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 0, non_block: 0, pid: 2012, name: kwatchdog

  clocksource_verify_percpu.part.0+0x6b/0x330
  clocksource_watchdog_kthread+0x193/0x1a0

It is due to the fact that clocksource_verify_choose_cpus() is invoked with
preemption disabled.  This function invokes get_random_u32() to obtain
random numbers for choosing CPUs.  The batched_entropy_32 local lock and/or
the base_crng.lock spinlock in driver/char/random.c will be acquired during
the call. In PREEMPT_RT kernel, they are both sleeping locks and so cannot
be acquired in atomic context.

Fix this problem by using migrate_disable() to allow smp_processor_id() to
be reliably used without introducing atomic context. preempt_disable() is
then called after clocksource_verify_choose_cpus() but before the
clocksource measurement is being run to avoid introducing unexpected
latency."

sched_ext: Fix incorrect autogroup migration detection

scx_move_task() is called from sched_move_task() and tells the BPF scheduler
that cgroup migration is being committed. sched_move_task() is used by both
cgroup and autogroup migrations and scx_move_task() tried to filter out
autogroup migrations by testing the destination cgroup and PF_EXITING but
this is not enough. In fact, without explicitly tagging the thread which is
doing the cgroup migration, there is no good way to tell apart
scx_move_task() invocations for racing migration to the root cgroup and an
autogroup migration.

This led to scx_move_task() incorrectly ignoring a migration from non-root
cgroup to an autogroup of the root cgroup triggering the following warning:

ring-buffer: Validate the persistent meta data subbuf array

The meta data for a mapped ring buffer contains an array of indexes of all
the subbuffers. The first entry is the reader page, and the rest of the
entries lay out the order of the subbuffers in how the ring buffer link
list is to be created.

The validator currently makes sure that all the entries are within the
range of 0 and nr_subbufs. But it does not check if there are any
duplicates.

While working on the ring buffer, I corrupted this array, where I added
duplicates. The validator did not catch it and created the ring buffer
link list on top of it. Luckily, the corruption was only that the reader
page was also in the writer path and only presented corrupted data but did
not crash the kernel. But if there were duplicates in the writer side,
then it could corrupt the ring buffer link list and cause a crash.

Create a bitmask array with the size of the number of subbuffers. Then
clear it. When walking through the subbuf array checking to see if the
entries are within the range, test if its bit is already set in the
subbuf_mask. If it is, then there is duplicates and fail the validation.
If not, set the corresponding bit and continue."

The reason was that the code that maps the ring buffer pages to user space
has:

	page = virt_to_page((void *)cpu_buffer->subbuf_ids[s]);

And uses that in:

	vm_insert_pages(vma, vma->vm_start, pages, &nr_pages);

But virt_to_page() does not work with vmap()'d memory which is what the
persistent ring buffer has. It is rather trivial to allow this, but for
now just disable mmap() of instances that have their ring buffer from the
reserve_mem option.

If an mmap() is performed on a persistent buffer it will return -ENODEV
just like it would if the .mmap field wasn't defined in the
file_operations structure."

rhashtable: Fix potential deadlock by moving schedule_work outside lock

Move the hash table growth check and work scheduling outside the
rht lock to prevent a possible circular locking dependency.

The original implementation could trigger a lockdep warning due to
a potential deadlock scenario involving nested locks between
rhashtable bucket, rq lock, and dsq lock. By relocating the
growth check and work scheduling after releasing the rth lock, we break
this potential deadlock chain.

This change expands the flexibility of rhashtable by removing
restrictive locking that previously limited its use in scheduler
and workqueue contexts.

Import to say that this calls rht_grow_above_75(), which reads from
struct rhashtable without holding the lock, if this is a problem, we can
move the check to the lock, and schedule the workqueue after the lock.

net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: fix freeing IRQ in am65_cpsw_nuss_remove_tx_chns()

When getting the IRQ we use k3_udma_glue_tx_get_irq() which returns
negative error value on error. So not NULL check is not sufficient
to deteremine if IRQ is valid. Check that IRQ is greater then zero
to ensure it is valid.

There is no issue at probe time but at runtime user can invoke
.set_channels which results in the following call chain.
am65_cpsw_set_channels()
 am65_cpsw_nuss_update_tx_rx_chns()
  am65_cpsw_nuss_remove_tx_chns()

At this point if am65_cpsw_nuss_init_tx_chns() fails due to

negative value.

Then, at subsequent .set_channels with higher channel count we
will attempt to free an invalid IRQ in am65_cpsw_nuss_remove_tx_chns()

The root cause is acpi_enable_all_wakeup_gpes() uses a mutex to protect
acpi_hw_enable_all_wakeup_gpes(), and acpi_ut_acquire_mutex() may cause
a thread switch. Since there is no longer concurrent execution during
loongarch_acpi_suspend(), we can call acpi_hw_enable_all_wakeup_gpes()

PCI: rcar-ep: Fix incorrect variable used when calling devm_request_mem_region()

The rcar_pcie_parse_outbound_ranges() uses the devm_request_mem_region()
macro to request a needed resource. A string variable that lives on the
stack is then used to store a dynamically computed resource name, which
is then passed on as one of the macro arguments. This can lead to
undefined behavior.

Depending on the current contents of the memory, the manifestations of
errors may vary. One possible output may be as follows:

  $ cat /proc/iomem
  30000000-37ffffff :
  38000000-3fffffff :

Sometimes, garbage may appear after the colon.

In very rare cases, if no NULL-terminator is found in memory, the system
might crash because the string iterator will overrun which can lead to
access of unmapped memory above the stack.

Thus, fix this by replacing outbound_name with the name of the previously
requested resource. With the changes applied, the output will be as
follows:

  $ cat /proc/iomem
  30000000-37ffffff : memory2
  38000000-3fffffff : memory3

return 0 and clear the NAPI_STATE_SCHED bit of napi->state, causing this
napi to be re-polled in net_rx_action() until __do_softirq() times out.
Since the NAPI_STATE_SCHED bit has been cleared, napi_schedule_rps() can
be retriggered in enqueue_to_backlog(), causing this issue.

Making the napi's weight always non-zero solves this problem.

block: fix queue freeze vs limits lock order in sysfs store methods

queue_attr_store() always freezes a device queue before calling the
attribute store operation. For attributes that control queue limits, the
store operation will also lock the queue limits with a call to
queue_limits_start_update(). However, some drivers (e.g. SCSI sd) may
need to issue commands to a device to obtain limit values from the
hardware with the queue limits locked. This creates a potential ABBA
deadlock situation if a user attempts to modify a limit (thus freezing
the device queue) while the device driver starts a revalidation of the
device queue limits.

Avoid such deadlock by not freezing the queue before calling the
->store_limit() method in struct queue_sysfs_entry and instead use the
queue_limits_commit_update_frozen helper to freeze the queue after taking
the limits lock.

This also removes taking the sysfs lock for the store_limit method as
it doesn't protect anything here, but creates even more nesting.
Hopefully it will go away from the actual sysfs methods entirely soon.

rxrpc, afs: Fix peer hash locking vs RCU callback

In its address list, afs now retains pointers to and refs on one or more
rxrpc_peer objects.  The address list is freed under RCU and at this time,
it puts the refs on those peers.

Now, when an rxrpc_peer object runs out of refs, it gets removed from the
peer hash table and, for that, rxrpc has to take a spinlock.  However, it
is now being called from afs's RCU cleanup, which takes place in BH
context - but it is just taking an ordinary spinlock.

The put may also be called from non-BH context, and so there exists the
possibility of deadlock if the BH-based RCU cleanup happens whilst the hash
spinlock is held.  This led to the attached lockdep complaint.

Fix this by changing spinlocks of rxnet->peer_hash_lock back to
BH-disabling locks.

timers/migration: Fix off-by-one root mis-connection

Before attaching a new root to the old root, the children counter of the
new root is checked to verify that only the upcoming CPU's top group have
been connected to it. However since the recently added commit b729cc1ec21a
(""timers/migration: Fix another race between hotplug and idle entry/exit"")
this check is not valid anymore because the old root is pre-accounted
as a child to the new root. Therefore after connecting the upcoming
CPU's top group to the new root, the children count to be expected must
be 2 and not 1 anymore.

This omission results in the old root to not be connected to the new
root. Then eventually the system may run with more than one top level,
which defeats the purpose of a single idle migrator.

Also the old root is pre-accounted but not connected upon the new root
creation. But it can be connected to the new root later on. Therefore
the old root may be accounted twice to the new root. The propagation of
such overcommit can end up creating a double final top-level root with a
groupmask incorrectly initialized. Although harmless given that the final
top level roots will never have a parent to walk up to, this oddity
opportunistically reported the core issue:

hrtimers: Force migrate away hrtimers queued after CPUHP_AP_HRTIMERS_DYING

hrtimers are migrated away from the dying CPU to any online target at
the CPUHP_AP_HRTIMERS_DYING stage in order not to delay bandwidth timers
handling tasks involved in the CPU hotplug forward progress.

However wakeups can still be performed by the outgoing CPU after
CPUHP_AP_HRTIMERS_DYING. Those can result again in bandwidth timers being
armed. Depending on several considerations (crystal ball power management
based election, earliest timer already enqueued, timer migration enabled or
not), the target may eventually be the current CPU even if offline. If that
happens, the timer is eventually ignored.

The most notable example is RCU which had to deal with each and every of
those wake-ups by deferring them to an online CPU, along with related
workarounds:

_ e787644caf76 (rcu: Defer RCU kthreads wakeup when CPU is dying)
_ 9139f93209d1 (rcu/nocb: Fix RT throttling hrtimer armed from offline CPU)
_ f7345ccc62a4 (rcu/nocb: Fix rcuog wake-up from offline softirq)

The problem isn't confined to RCU though as the stop machine kthread
(which runs CPUHP_AP_HRTIMERS_DYING) reports its completion at the end
of its work through cpu_stop_signal_done() and performs a wake up that
eventually arms the deadline server timer:

batman-adv: Drop unmanaged ELP metric worker

The ELP worker needs to calculate new metric values for all neighbors
""reachable"" over an interface. Some of the used metric sources require
locks which might need to sleep. This sleep is incompatible with the RCU
list iterator used for the recorded neighbors. The initial approach to work
around of this problem was to queue another work item per neighbor and then
run this in a new context.

Even when this solved the RCU vs might_sleep() conflict, it has a major
problems: Nothing was stopping the work item in case it is not needed
anymore - for example because one of the related interfaces was removed or
the batman-adv module was unloaded - resulting in potential invalid memory
accesses.

Directly canceling the metric worker also has various problems:

* cancel_work_sync for a to-be-deactivated interface is called with
  rtnl_lock held. But the code in the ELP metric worker also tries to use
  rtnl_lock() - which will never return in this case. This also means that
  cancel_work_sync would never return because it is waiting for the worker
  to finish.
* iterating over the neighbor list for the to-be-deactivated interface is
  currently done using the RCU specific methods. Which means that it is
  possible to miss items when iterating over it without the associated
  spinlock - a behaviour which is acceptable for a periodic metric check
  but not for a cleanup routine (which must ""stop"" all still running
  workers)

The better approch is to get rid of the per interface neighbor metric
worker and handle everything in the interface worker. The original problems
are solved by:

* creating a list of neighbors which require new metric information inside
  the RCU protected context, gathering the metric according to the new list
  outside the RCU protected context
* only use rcu_trylock inside metric gathering code to avoid a deadlock
  when the cancel_delayed_work_sync is called in the interface removal code
  (which is called with the rtnl_lock held)"

CVE-2025-26326	2025-02-28T15:15:13.743	2025-03-13T16:15:27.473	A vulnerability was identified in the NVDA Remote (version 2.6.4) and Tele NVDA Remote (version 2025.3.3) remote connection add-ons, which allows an attacker to obtain total control of the remote system by guessing a weak password. The problem occurs because these add-ons accept any password entered by the user and do not have an additional authentication or computer verification mechanism. Tests indicate that more than 1,000 systems use easy-to-guess passwords, many with less than 4 to 6 characters, including common sequences. This allows brute force attacks or trial-and-error attempts by malicious invaders. The vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker who knows or can guess the password used in the connection. As a result, the attacker gains complete access to the affected system and can execute commands, modify files, and compromise user security.	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Prior to version 1.2.0, the backup restore functionality is vulnerable to path traversal in the TAR entry's name, allowing an attacker to overwrite any file on the system with their content. By overwriting an included `.js` file and restarting the container, this allows for Remote Code Execution as an administrator. The remote code execution occurs because any user with the `backups:create` and `backups:update` (only administrators by default) is able to overwrite any file on the system.

Any user with the `backups:create`, `backups:update` and `templates:update` permissions (only administrators by default) can write arbitrary content to anywhere on the filesystem. By overwriting source code, it is possible to achieve Remote Code Execution. Version 1.2.0 fixes the issue.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2025-27414	2025-02-28T21:15:27.957	2025-02-28T21:15:27.957	"MinIO is a high performance object storage. Starting in RELEASE.2024-06-06T09-36-42Z and prior to 
RELEASE.2025-02-28T09-55-16Z, a bug in evaluating the trust of the SSH key used in an SFTP connection to MinIO allows authentication bypass and unauthorized data access. On a MinIO server with SFTP access configured and using LDAP as an external identity provider, MinIO supports SSH key based authentication for SFTP connections when the user has the `sshPublicKey` attribute set in their LDAP server. The server trusts the client's key only when the public key is the same as the `sshPublicKey` attribute. Due to the bug, when the user has no `sshPublicKey` property in LDAP, the server ends up trusting the key allowing the client to perform any FTP operations allowed by the MinIO access policies associated with the LDAP user (or any of their groups). Three requirements must be met in order to exploit the vulnerability. First, the MinIO server must be configured to allow SFTP access and use LDAP as an external identity provider. Second, the attacker must have knowledge of an LDAP username that does not have the `sshPublicKey` property set. Third, such an LDAP username or one of their groups must also have some MinIO access policy configured. When this bug is successfully exploited, the attacker can perform any FTP operations (i.e. reading, writing, deleting and listing objects) allowed by the access policy associated with the LDAP user account (and their groups). Version 1.2.0 fixes the issue."
