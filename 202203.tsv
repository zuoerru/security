CVE-2022-24719	2022-03-01T21:15:07.923	2024-11-21T06:50:56.753	Fluture-Node is a FP-style HTTP and streaming utils for Node based on Fluture. Using `followRedirects` or `followRedirectsWith` with any of the redirection strategies built into fluture-node 4.0.0 or 4.0.1, paired with a request that includes confidential headers such as Authorization or Cookie, exposes you to a vulnerability where, if the destination server were to redirect the request to a server on a third-party domain, or the same domain over unencrypted HTTP, the headers would be included in the follow-up request and be exposed to the third party, or potential http traffic sniffing. The redirection strategies made available in version 4.0.2 automatically redact confidential headers when a redirect is followed across to another origin. A workaround has been identified by using a custom redirection strategy via the `followRedirectsWith` function. The custom strategy can be based on the new strategies available in fluture-node@4.0.2.	2.6	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

Prior to versions 0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21, an integer overflow in cmark-gfm's table row parsing `table.c:row_from_string` may lead to heap memory corruption when parsing tables who's marker rows contain more than UINT16_MAX columns. The impact of this heap corruption ranges from Information Leak to Arbitrary Code Execution depending on how and where `cmark-gfm` is used. If `cmark-gfm` is used for rendering remote user controlled markdown, this vulnerability may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in applications employing affected versions of the `cmark-gfm` library. This vulnerability has been patched in the following cmark-gfm versions 0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21. A workaround is available. The vulnerability exists in the table markdown extensions of cmark-gfm.

CVE-2022-24713	2022-03-08T19:15:08.000	2024-11-21T06:50:55.947	regex is an implementation of regular expressions for the Rust language. The regex crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service attacks caused by untrusted regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part of the crate's API. Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing, and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes. All versions of the regex crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from regex 1.5.5. All users accepting user-controlled regexes are recommended to upgrade immediately to the latest version of the regex crate. Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability. Because of this, it us not recommend to deny known problematic regexes.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2022-24734	2022-03-09T22:15:09.363	2024-11-21T06:50:58.673	MyBB is a free and open source forum software. In affected versions the Admin CP's Settings management module does not validate setting types correctly on insertion and update, making it possible to add settings of supported type `php` with PHP code, executed on on _Change Settings_ pages. This results in a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. The vulnerable module requires Admin CP access with the `Can manage settings?` permission. MyBB's Settings module, which allows administrators to add, edit, and delete non-default settings, stores setting data in an options code string ($options_code; mybb_settings.optionscode database column) that identifies the setting type and its options, separated by a new line character (\n). In MyBB 1.2.0, support for setting type php was added, for which the remaining part of the options code is PHP code executed on Change Settings pages (reserved for plugins and internal use). MyBB 1.8.30 resolves this issue. There are no known workarounds.	7.2	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2022-0618	2022-03-10T17:44:56.647	2024-11-21T06:39:02.290	A program using swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack, caused by a network peer sending a specially crafted HTTP/2 frame. This vulnerability is caused by a logical error when parsing a HTTP/2 HEADERS or HTTP/2 PUSH_PROMISE frame where the frame contains padding information without any other data. This logical error caused confusion about the size of the frame, leading to a parsing error. This parsing error immediately crashes the entire process. Sending a HEADERS frame or PUSH_PROMISE frame with HTTP/2 padding information does not require any special permission, so any HTTP/2 connection peer may send such a frame. For clients, this means any server to which they connect may launch this attack. For servers, anyone they allow to connect to them may launch such an attack. The attack is low-effort: it takes very little resources to send an appropriately crafted frame. The impact on availability is high: receiving the frame immediately crashes the server, dropping all in-flight connections and causing the service to need to restart. It is straightforward for an attacker to repeatedly send appropriately crafted frames, so attackers require very few resources to achieve a substantial denial of service. The attack does not have any confidentiality or integrity risks in and of itself: swift-nio-http2 is parsing the frame in memory-safe code, so the crash is safe. However, sudden process crashes can lead to violations of invariants in services, so it is possible that this attack can be used to trigger an error condition that has confidentiality or integrity risks. The risk can be mitigated if untrusted peers can be prevented from communicating with the service. This mitigation is not available to many services. The issue is fixed by rewriting the parsing code to correctly handle the condition. The issue was found by automated fuzzing by oss-fuzz.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2022-25217	2022-03-10T17:47:01.810	2024-11-21T06:51:49.497	Use of a hard-coded cryptographic key pair by the telnetd_startup service allows an attacker on the local area network to obtain a root shell on the device over telnet. The builds of telnetd_startup included in the version 22.5.9.163 of the K2 firmware, and version 32.1.15.93 of the K3C firmware (possibly amongst many other releases) included both the private and public RSA keys. The remaining versions cited here redacted the private key, but left the public key unchanged. An attacker in possession of the leaked private key may, through a scripted exchange of UDP packets, instruct telnetd_startup to spawn an unauthenticated telnet shell as root, by means of which they can then obtain complete control of the device. A consequence of the limited availablility of firmware images for testing is that models and versions not listed here may share this vulnerability.	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2022-25218	2022-03-10T17:47:02.133	2024-11-21T06:51:49.603	"The use of the RSA algorithm without OAEP, or any other padding scheme, in telnetd_startup, allows an unauthenticated attacker on the local area network to achieve a significant degree of control over the ""plaintext"" to which an arbitrary blob of ciphertext will be decrypted by OpenSSL's RSA_public_decrypt() function. This weakness allows the attacker to manipulate the various iterations of the telnetd startup state machine and eventually obtain a root shell on the device, by means of an exchange of crafted UDP packets. In all versions but K2 22.5.9.163 and K3C 32.1.15.93 a successful attack also requires the exploitation of a null-byte interaction error (CVE-2022-25219)."	8.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2022-25219	2022-03-10T17:47:02.457	2024-11-21T06:51:49.703	A null byte interaction error has been discovered in the code that the telnetd_startup daemon uses to construct a pair of ephemeral passwords that allow a user to spawn a telnet service on the router, and to ensure that the telnet service persists upon reboot. By means of a crafted exchange of UDP packets, an unauthenticated attacker on the local network can leverage this null byte interaction error in such a way as to make those ephemeral passwords predictable (with 1-in-94 odds). Since the attacker must manipulate data processed by the OpenSSL function RSA_public_decrypt(), successful exploitation of this vulnerability depends on the use of an unpadded RSA cipher (CVE-2022-25218).	8.4	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2022-24726	2022-03-10T21:15:14.603	2024-11-21T06:50:57.670	Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. In affected versions the Istio control plane, istiod, is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a malicious attacker that sends a specially crafted message which results in the control plane crashing when the validating webhook for a cluster is exposed publicly. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15017, but does not require any authentication from the attacker. For simple installations, Istiod is typically only reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments, especially [external istiod](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/external-controlplane/) topologies, this port is exposed over the public internet. This issue has been patched in versions 1.13.2, 1.12.5 and 1.11.8. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable access to a validating webhook that is exposed to the public internet or restrict the set of IP addresses that can query it to a set of known, trusted entities.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2022-23625	2022-03-11T18:15:31.493	2024-11-21T06:48:57.743	Wire-ios is a messaging application using the wire protocol on apple's ios platform. In versions prior to 3.95 malformed resource identifiers may render the iOS Wire Client completely unusable by causing it to repeatedly crash on launch. These malformed resource identifiers can be generated and sent between Wire users. The root cause lies in [wireapp/wire-ios-transport](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios-transport), where code responsible for removing sensible tokens before logging may fail and lead to a crash (Swift exception) of the application. This causes undesirable behavior, however the (greater) Wire system is still functional. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds for this issue.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2021-41848	2022-03-11T23:15:08.840	2024-11-21T06:26:53.853	An issue was discovered in Luna Simo PPR1.180610.011/202001031830. It mishandles software updates such that local third-party apps can provide a spoofed software update file that contains an arbitrary shell script and arbitrary ARM binary, where both will be executed as the root user with an SELinux domain named osi. To exploit this vulnerability, a local third-party app needs to have write access to external storage to write the spoofed update at the expected path. The vulnerable system binary (i.e., /system/bin/osi_bin) does not perform any authentication of the update file beyond ensuring that it is encrypted with an AES key (that is hard-coded in the vulnerable system binary). Processes executing with the osi SELinux domain can programmatically perform the following actions: install apps, grant runtime permissions to apps (including permissions with protection levels of dangerous and development), access extensive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) using the programmatically grant permissions, uninstall apps, set the default launcher app to a malicious launcher app that spoofs other apps, set a network proxy to intercept network traffic, unload kernel modules, set the default keyboard to a keyboard that has keylogging functionality, examine notification contents, send text messages, and more. The spoofed update can optionally contain an arbitrary ARM binary that will be locally stored in internal storage and executed at system startup to achieve persistent code execution as the root user with the osi SELinux domain. This ARM binary will continue to execute at startup even if the app that provided the spoofed update is uninstalled.	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

When using the default configuration of fish, changing to a directory automatically runs `git` commands in order to display information about the current repository in the prompt. If an attacker can convince a user to change their current directory into one controlled by the attacker, such as on a shared file system or extracted archive, fish will run arbitrary commands under the attacker's control. This problem has been fixed in fish 3.4.0. Note that running git in these directories, including using the git tab completion, remains a potential trigger for this issue.

Between versions 14.0.0-alpha.5 and 15.0.0-alpha.0, a user could have their authentication cookie replaced with an authentication cookie from another user, effectively giving them control of the other user's account and privileges. This occurs when using an outdated version of the `react-cookie` library and a server is under high load. A proof of concept does not currently exist, but it is possible for this issue to occur in the wild. The patch and fix is present in Volto 15.0.0-alpha.0.

CVE-2022-0778	2022-03-15T17:15:08.513	2024-11-21T06:39:22.540	The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m).

CVE-2022-23610	2022-03-16T18:15:11.617	2024-11-21T06:48:55.640	wire-server provides back end services for Wire, an open source messenger. In versions of wire-server prior to the 2022-01-27 release, it was possible to craft DSA Signatures to bypass SAML SSO and impersonate any Wire user with SAML credentials. In teams with SAML, but without SCIM, it was possible to create new accounts with fake SAML credentials. Under certain conditions that can be established by an attacker, an upstream library for parsing, rendering, signing, and validating SAML XML data was accepting public keys as trusted that were provided by the attacker in the signature. As a consequence, the attacker could login as any user in any Wire team with SAML SSO enabled. If SCIM was not enabled, the attacker could also create new users with new SAML NameIDs. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to know the SSO login code (distributed to all team members with SAML credentials and visible in the Team Management app), the SAML EntityID identifying the IdP (a URL not considered sensitive, but usually hard to guess, also visible in Team Management), and the SAML NameID of the user (usually an email address or a nick). The issue has been fixed in wire-server `2022-01-27` and is already deployed on all Wire managed services. On premise instances of wire-server need to be updated to `2022-01-27`, so that their backends are no longer affected. There are currently no known workarounds. More detailed information about how to reproduce the vulnerability and mitigation strategies is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

CVE-2022-24761	2022-03-17T13:15:07.647	2024-11-21T06:51:02.277	Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. When using Waitress versions 2.1.0 and prior behind a proxy that does not properly validate the incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230 standard, Waitress and the frontend proxy may disagree on where one request starts and where it ends. This would allow requests to be smuggled via the front-end proxy to waitress and later behavior. There are two classes of vulnerability that may lead to request smuggling that are addressed by this advisory: The use of Python's `int()` to parse strings into integers, leading to `+10` to be parsed as `10`, or `0x01` to be parsed as `1`, where as the standard specifies that the string should contain only digits or hex digits; and Waitress does not support chunk extensions, however it was discarding them without validating that they did not contain illegal characters. This vulnerability has been patched in Waitress 2.1.1. A workaround is available. When deploying a proxy in front of waitress, turning on any and all functionality to make sure that the request matches the RFC7230 standard. Certain proxy servers may not have this functionality though and users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of waitress instead.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

In mitmproxy 7.0.4 and below, a malicious client or server is able to perform HTTP request smuggling attacks through mitmproxy. This means that a malicious client/server could smuggle a request/response through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's HTTP message body. While mitmproxy would only see one request, the target server would see multiple requests. A smuggled request is still captured as part of another request's body, but it does not appear in the request list and does not go through the usual mitmproxy event hooks, where users may have implemented custom access control checks or input sanitization. Unless mitmproxy is used to protect an HTTP/1 service, no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixed in mitmproxy 8.0.0 and above.

CVE-2021-46390	2022-03-21T20:15:13.610	2024-11-21T06:34:01.610	An access control issue in the authentication module of Lexar_F35 v1.0.34 allows attackers to access sensitive data and cause a Denial of Service (DoS). An attacker without access to securely protected data on a secure USB flash drive can bypass user authentication without having any information related to the password of the registered user. The secure USB flash drive transmits the password entered by the user to the authentication module in the drive after the user registers a password, and then the input password is compared with the registered password stored in the authentication module. Subsequently, the module returns the comparison result for the authentication decision. Therefore, an attacker can bypass password authentication by analyzing the functions that return the password verification or comparison results and manipulate the authentication result values. Accordingly, even if attackers enter an incorrect password, they can be authenticated as a legitimate user and can therefore exploit functions of the secure USB flash drive by manipulating the authentication result values.	6.8	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2022-24730	2022-03-23T21:15:08.023	2024-11-21T06:50:58.157	Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with version 1.3.0 but before versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0 is vulnerable to a path traversal bug, compounded by an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user with read-only repository access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user who has been granted `get` access for a repository containing a Helm chart can craft an API request to the `/api/v1/repositories/{repo_url}/appdetails` endpoint to leak the contents of out-of-bounds files from the repo-server. The malicious payload would reference an out-of-bounds file, and the contents of that file would be returned as part of the response. Contents from a non-YAML file may be returned as part of an error message. The attacker would have to know or guess the location of the target file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include files from other Applications' source repositories or any secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. This vulnerability is patched in Argo CD versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0. The patches prevent path traversal and limit access to users who either A) have been granted Application `create` privileges or B) have been granted Application `get` privileges and are requesting details for a `repo_url` that has already been used for the given Application. There are currently no known workarounds.	7.7	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2022-24731	2022-03-23T21:15:08.083	2024-11-21T06:50:58.300	Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with version 1.5.0 but before versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0 is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability, allowing a malicious user with read/write access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user who has been granted `create` or `update` access to Applications can leak the contents of any text file on the repo-server. By crafting a malicious Helm chart and using it in an Application, the attacker can retrieve the sensitive file's contents either as part of the generated manifests or in an error message. The attacker would have to know or guess the location of the target file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include files from another Application's source repositories or any secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. This vulnerability is patched in Argo CD versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0. The problem can be mitigated by avoiding storing secrets in git, avoiding mounting secrets as files on the repo-server, avoiding decrypting secrets into files on the repo-server, and carefully limiting who can `create` or `update` Applications.	6.8	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2022-24757	2022-03-23T21:15:08.143	2024-11-21T06:51:01.750	The Jupyter Server provides the backend (i.e. the core services, APIs, and REST endpoints) for Jupyter web applications. Prior to version 1.15.4, unauthorized actors can access sensitive information from server logs. Anytime a 5xx error is triggered, the auth cookie and other header values are recorded in Jupyter Server logs by default. Considering these logs do not require root access, an attacker can monitor these logs, steal sensitive auth/cookie information, and gain access to the Jupyter server. Jupyter Server version 1.15.4 contains a patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVE-2022-24768	2022-03-23T22:15:13.143	2024-11-21T06:51:03.453	Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. All unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with 1.0.0 are vulnerable to an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user to potentially escalate their privileges to admin-level. Versions starting with 0.8.0 and 0.5.0 contain limited versions of this issue. To perform exploits, an authorized Argo CD user must have push access to an Application's source git or Helm repository or `sync` and `override` access to an Application. Once a user has that access, different exploitation levels are possible depending on their other RBAC privileges. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.2, 2.2.8, and 2.1.14. Some mitigation measures are available but do not serve as a substitute for upgrading. To avoid privilege escalation, limit who has push access to Application source repositories or `sync` + `override` access to Applications; and limit which repositories are available in projects where users have `update` access to Applications. To avoid unauthorized resource inspection/tampering, limit who has `delete`, `get`, or `action` access to Applications.	9.9	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2022-24769	2022-03-24T20:15:09.493	2024-11-21T06:51:03.593	Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable and accelerate software containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) prior to version 20.10.14 where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during `execve(2)`. Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set. Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set. Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted. This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.14. Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset. This fix changes Moby (Docker Engine) behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment. As a workaround, the entry point of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.	5.9	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

The imgcrypt function `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether the current used is authorized to access an encrypted image and prevent the user from running an image that another user previously decrypted on the same system. In versions prior to 1.1.4, a failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. Only the first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its layers available locally since it could not be run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However, this verdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in the ManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4. Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

All users are recommended to upgrade to 1.20.3 immediately.	10.0	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2022-24784	2022-03-25T22:15:08.153	2024-11-21T06:51:05.360	Statamic is a Laravel and Git powered CMS. Before versions 3.2.39 and 3.3.2, it is possible to confirm a single character of a user's password hash using a specially crafted regular expression filter in the users endpoint of the REST API. Multiple such requests can eventually uncover the entire hash. The hash is not present in the response, however the presence or absence of a result confirms if the character is in the right position. The API has throttling enabled by default, making this a time intensive task. Both the REST API and the users endpoint need to be enabled, as they are disabled by default. The issue has been fixed in versions 3.2.39 and above, and 3.3.2 and above.	3.7	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

CVE-2022-24758	2022-03-31T23:15:07.997	2024-11-21T06:51:01.887	The Jupyter notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactive computing. Prior to version 6.4.9, unauthorized actors can access sensitive information from server logs. Anytime a 5xx error is triggered, the auth cookie and other header values are recorded in Jupyter server logs by default. Considering these logs do not require root access, an attacker can monitor these logs, steal sensitive auth/cookie information, and gain access to the Jupyter server. Jupyter notebook version 6.4.x contains a patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2022-24791	2022-03-31T23:15:08.063	2024-11-21T06:51:06.277	Wasmtime is a standalone JIT-style runtime for WebAssembly, using Cranelift. There is a use after free vulnerability in Wasmtime when both running Wasm that uses externrefs and enabling epoch interruption in Wasmtime. If you are not explicitly enabling epoch interruption (it is disabled by default) then you are not affected. If you are explicitly disabling the Wasm reference types proposal (it is enabled by default) then you are also not affected. The use after free is caused by Cranelift failing to emit stack maps when there are safepoints inside cold blocks. Cold blocks occur when epoch interruption is enabled. Cold blocks are emitted at the end of compiled functions, and change the order blocks are emitted versus defined. This reordering accidentally caused Cranelift to skip emitting some stack maps because it expected to emit the stack maps in block definition order, rather than block emission order. When Wasmtime would eventually collect garbage, it would fail to find live references on the stack because of the missing stack maps, think that they were unreferenced garbage, and therefore reclaim them. Then after the collection ended, the Wasm code could use the reclaimed-too-early references, which is a use after free. Patches have been released in versions 0.34.2 and 0.35.2, which fix the vulnerability. All Wasmtime users are recommended to upgrade to these patched versions. If upgrading is not an option for you at this time, you can avoid the vulnerability by either: disabling the Wasm reference types proposal, config.wasm_reference_types(false); or by disabling epoch interruption if you were previously enabling it. config.epoch_interruption(false).	8.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2022-24794	2022-03-31T23:15:08.127	2024-11-21T06:51:06.703	Express OpenID Connect is an Express JS middleware implementing sign on for Express web apps using OpenID Connect. Users of the `requiresAuth` middleware, either directly or through the default `authRequired` option, are vulnerable to an Open Redirect when the middleware is applied to a catch all route. If all routes under `example.com` are protected with the `requiresAuth` middleware, a visit to `http://example.com//google.com` will be redirected to `google.com` after login because the original url reported by the Express framework is not properly sanitized. This vulnerability affects versions prior to 2.7.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N		
CVE-2022-24796	2022-03-31T23:15:08.187	2024-11-21T06:51:06.980	RaspberryMatic is a free and open-source operating system for running a cloud-free smart-home using the homematicIP / HomeMatic hardware line of IoT devices. A Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the file upload facility of the WebUI interface of RaspberryMatic exists. Missing input validation/sanitization in the file upload mechanism allows remote, unauthenticated attackers with network access to the WebUI interface to achieve arbitrary operating system command execution via shell metacharacters in the HTTP query string. Injected commands are executed as root, thus leading to a full compromise of the underlying system and all its components. Versions after `2.31.25.20180428` and prior to `3.63.8.20220330` are affected. Users are advised to update to version `3.63.8.20220330` or newer.

CVE-2022-24798	2022-03-31T23:15:08.307	2024-11-21T06:51:07.260	Internet Routing Registry daemon version 4 is an IRR database server, processing IRR objects in the RPSL format. IRRd did not always filter password hashes in query responses relating to `mntner` objects and database exports. This may have allowed adversaries to retrieve some of these hashes, perform a brute-force search for the clear-text passphrase, and use these to make unauthorised changes to affected IRR objects. This issue only affected instances that process password hashes, which means it is limited to IRRd instances that serve authoritative databases. IRRd instances operating solely as mirrors of other IRR databases are not affected. This has been fixed in IRRd 4.2.3 and the main branch. Versions in the 4.1.x series never were affected. Users of the 4.2.x series are strongly recommended to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
