In practice the impact of this vulnerability is limited, as in most configurations a user who can log into the GoCD UI as an admin also has host administration permissions for the host/container that GoCD runs on, in order to manage artifact storage and other service-level configuration options. Additionally, since a GoCD admin has ability to configure and schedule pipelines tasks on all GoCD agents available to the server, the fundamental functionality of GoCD allows co-ordinated task execution similar to that of post-backup-scripts. However in restricted environments where the host administration is separated from the role of a GoCD admin, this may be unexpected. The issue is fixed in GoCD 24.5.0.

In practice the impact of this vulnerability is limited, in most cases without combining with another vulnerability, as only GoCD (super) admins have the ability to abuse this vulnerability.

Prior to version 1.12.0, the PULL mode clusters registered with the `karmadactl register` command have excessive privileges to access control plane resources. By abusing these permissions, an attacker able to authenticate as the karmada-agent to a karmada cluster would be able to obtain administrative privileges over the entire federation system including all registered member clusters. Since Karmada v1.12.0, command `karmadactl register` restricts the access permissions of pull mode member clusters to control plane resources. This way, an attacker able to authenticate as the karmada-agent cannot control other member clusters in Karmada. As a workaround, one may restrict the access permissions of pull mode member clusters to control plane resources according to Karmada Component Permissions Docs.					
CVE-2024-56514	2025-01-03T17:15:09.017	2025-01-03T17:15:09.017	Karmada is a Kubernetes management system that allows users to run cloud-native applications across multiple Kubernetes clusters and clouds. Prior to version 1.12.0, both in karmadactl and karmada-operator, it is possible to supply a filesystem path, or an HTTP(s) URL to retrieve the custom resource definitions(CRDs) needed by Karmada. The CRDs are downloaded as a gzipped tarfile and are vulnerable to a TarSlip vulnerability. An attacker able to supply a malicious CRD file into a Karmada initialization could write arbitrary files in arbitrary paths of the filesystem. From Karmada version 1.12.0, when processing custom CRDs files, CRDs archive verification is utilized to enhance file system robustness. A workaround is available. Someone who needs to set flag `--crd` to customize the CRD files required for Karmada initialization when using `karmadactl init` to set up Karmada can manually inspect the CRD files to check whether they contain sequences such as `../` that would alter file paths, to determine if they potentially include malicious files. When using karmada-operator to set up Karmada, one must upgrade one's karmada-operator to one of the fixed versions.

Starting in version 13.0.0 and prior to versions 13.5.8, 14.2.21, and 15.1.2, Next.js is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack that allows attackers to construct requests that leaves requests to Server Actions hanging until the hosting provider cancels the function execution. This vulnerability can also be used as a Denial of Wallet (DoW) attack when deployed in providers billing by response times. (Note: Next.js server is idle during that time and only keeps the connection open. CPU and memory footprint are low during that time.). Deployments without any protection against long running Server Action invocations are especially vulnerable. Hosting providers like Vercel or Netlify set a default maximum duration on function execution to reduce the risk of excessive billing. This is the same issue as if the incoming HTTP request has an invalid `Content-Length` header or never closes. If the host has no other mitigations to those then this vulnerability is novel. This vulnerability affects only Next.js deployments using Server Actions. The issue was resolved in Next.js 13.5.8, 14.2.21, and 15.1.2. We recommend that users upgrade to a safe version.

This occurs because cleanup_one_transaction() calls
destroy_delalloc_inodes() which calls invalidate_inode_pages2() which
takes the folio_lock before setting mapping to NULL. We fail to check
this, and subsequently call set_extent_mapping(), which assumes that
mapping != NULL (in fact it asserts that in debug mode)

Note that the ""fixes"" patch here is not the one that introduced the
race (the very first iteration of this code from 2009) but a more recent
change that made this particular crash happen in practice."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2024-56759	2025-01-06T17:15:40.900	2025-02-11T16:15:47.730	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix use-after-free when COWing tree bock and tracing is enabled

When a COWing a tree block, at btrfs_cow_block(), and we have the
tracepoint trace_btrfs_cow_block() enabled and preemption is also enabled
(CONFIG_PREEMPT=y), we can trigger a use-after-free in the COWed extent
buffer while inside the tracepoint code. This is because in some paths
that call btrfs_cow_block(), such as btrfs_search_slot(), we are holding
the last reference on the extent buffer @buf so btrfs_force_cow_block()
drops the last reference on the @buf extent buffer when it calls
free_extent_buffer_stale(buf), which schedules the release of the extent
buffer with RCU. This means that if we are on a kernel with preemption,
the current task may be preempted before calling trace_btrfs_cow_block()
and the extent buffer already released by the time trace_btrfs_cow_block()
is called, resulting in a use-after-free.

Fix this by moving the trace_btrfs_cow_block() from btrfs_cow_block() to
btrfs_force_cow_block() before the COWed extent buffer is freed.
This also has a side effect of invoking the tracepoint in the tree defrag
code, at defrag.c:btrfs_realloc_node(), since btrfs_force_cow_block() is
called there, but this is fine and it was actually missing there."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

PCI/MSI: Handle lack of irqdomain gracefully

Alexandre observed a warning emitted from pci_msi_setup_msi_irqs() on a
RISCV platform which does not provide PCI/MSI support:

 WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 1 at drivers/pci/msi/msi.h:121 pci_msi_setup_msi_irqs+0x2c/0x32
 __pci_enable_msix_range+0x30c/0x596
 pci_msi_setup_msi_irqs+0x2c/0x32
 pci_alloc_irq_vectors_affinity+0xb8/0xe2

RISCV uses hierarchical interrupt domains and correctly does not implement
the legacy fallback. The warning triggers from the legacy fallback stub.

That warning is bogus as the PCI/MSI layer knows whether a PCI/MSI parent
domain is associated with the device or not. There is a check for MSI-X,
which has a legacy assumption. But that legacy fallback assumption is only
valid when legacy support is enabled, but otherwise the check should simply
return -ENOTSUPP.

Loongarch tripped over the same problem and blindly enabled legacy support
without implementing the legacy fallbacks. There are weak implementations
which return an error, so the problem was papered over.

Correct pci_msi_domain_supports() to evaluate the legacy mode and add
the missing supported check into the MSI enable path to complete it."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

x86/fred: Clear WFE in missing-ENDBRANCH #CPs

An indirect branch instruction sets the CPU indirect branch tracker
(IBT) into WAIT_FOR_ENDBRANCH (WFE) state and WFE stays asserted
across the instruction boundary.  When the decoder finds an
inappropriate instruction while WFE is set ENDBR, the CPU raises a #CP
fault.

For the ""kernel IBT no ENDBR"" selftest where #CPs are deliberately
triggered, the WFE state of the interrupted context needs to be
cleared to let execution continue.  Otherwise when the CPU resumes
from the instruction that just caused the previous #CP, another
missing-ENDBRANCH #CP is raised and the CPU enters a dead loop.

This is not a problem with IDT because it doesn't preserve WFE and
IRET doesn't set WFE.  But FRED provides space on the entry stack
(in an expanded CS area) to save and restore the WFE state, thus the
WFE state is no longer clobbered, so software must clear it.

Clear WFE to avoid dead looping in ibt_clear_fred_wfe() and the
!ibt_fatal code path when execution is allowed to continue.

Clobbering WFE in any other circumstance is a security-relevant bug.

Based on the code analysis, it was determined that the /api/member/avatar API endpoint receives a base64 string as input. This string is then passed to the memberService.uploadAvatarByBase64 method for processing. Within the service, the base64-encoded image is parsed. For example, given a string like: data:image/html;base64,PGh0bWw+PGltZyBzcmM9eCBvbmVycm9yPWFsZXJ0KDEpPjwvaHRtbD4= the content after the comma is extracted and decoded using Base64.getDecoder().decode(). The substring from the 11th character up to the first occurrence of a semicolon (;) is assigned to the suffix variable (representing the file extension). The decoded content is then written to a file. However, the file extension is not validated, and since this functionality is exposed to the frontend, it poses significant security risks.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2024-55556	2025-01-07T16:15:37.017	2025-01-08T20:15:28.987	A vulnerability in Crater Invoice allows an unauthenticated attacker with knowledge of the APP_KEY to achieve remote command execution on the server by manipulating the laravel_session cookie, exploiting arbitrary deserialization through the encrypted session data. The exploitation vector of this vulnerability relies on an attacker obtaining Laravel's secret APP_KEY, which would allow them to decrypt and manipulate session cookies (laravel_session) containing serialized data. By altering this data and re-encrypting it with the APP_KEY, the attacker could trigger arbitrary deserialization on the server, potentially leading to remote command execution (RCE). The vulnerability is primarily exploited by accessing an exposed cookie and manipulating it using the secret key to gain malicious access to the server.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

During the user avatar upload workflow, a user can choose to upload and change their avatar at any time. During deletion, ClipBucket checks for the avatar_url as a filepath within the avatars subdirectory. If the URL path exists within the avatars directory, ClipBucket will delete it. There is no check for path traversal sequences in the provided user input (stored in the DB as avatar_url) therefore the final $file variable could be tainted with path traversal sequences. This leads to file deletion outside of the intended scope of the avatars folder. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.5.1 - 237.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

The route/{hash} route defined in the invoiceninja/routes/client.php file can be accessed without authentication. The parameter {hash} is passed to the function decrypt that expects a Laravel ciphered value containing a serialized object. (Furthermore, Laravel contains several gadget chains usable to trigger remote command execution from arbitrary deserialization.) Therefore, an attacker in possession of the APP_KEY is able to fully control a string passed to an unserialize function.	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2024-56770	2025-01-08T17:15:15.957	2025-10-01T20:17:51.170	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: netem: account for backlog updates from child qdisc

In general, 'qlen' of any classful qdisc should keep track of the
number of packets that the qdisc itself and all of its children holds.
In case of netem, 'qlen' only accounts for the packets in its internal
tfifo. When netem is used with a child qdisc, the child qdisc can use
'qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog' to inform its parent, netem, about created
or dropped SKBs. This function updates 'qlen' and the backlog statistics
of netem, but netem does not account for changes made by a child qdisc.
'qlen' then indicates the wrong number of packets in the tfifo.
If a child qdisc creates new SKBs during enqueue and informs its parent
about this, netem's 'qlen' value is increased. When netem dequeues the
newly created SKBs from the child, the 'qlen' in netem is not updated.
If 'qlen' reaches the configured sch->limit, the enqueue function stops
working, even though the tfifo is not full.

Reproduce the bug:
Ensure that the sender machine has GSO enabled. Configure netem as root
qdisc and tbf as its child on the outgoing interface of the machine
as follows:
$ tc qdisc add dev <oif> root handle 1: netem delay 100ms limit 100
$ tc qdisc add dev <oif> parent 1:0 tbf rate 50Mbit burst 1542 latency 50ms

Send bulk TCP traffic out via this interface, e.g., by running an iPerf3
client on the machine. Check the qdisc statistics:
$ tc -s qdisc show dev <oif>

Statistics after 10s of iPerf3 TCP test before the fix (note that
netem's backlog > limit, netem stopped accepting packets):
qdisc netem 1: root refcnt 2 limit 1000 delay 100ms
 Sent 2767766 bytes 1848 pkt (dropped 652, overlimits 0 requeues 0)
 backlog 4294528236b 1155p requeues 0
qdisc tbf 10: parent 1:1 rate 50Mbit burst 1537b lat 50ms
 Sent 2767766 bytes 1848 pkt (dropped 327, overlimits 7601 requeues 0)
 backlog 0b 0p requeues 0

Statistics after the fix:
qdisc netem 1: root refcnt 2 limit 1000 delay 100ms
 Sent 37766372 bytes 24974 pkt (dropped 9, overlimits 0 requeues 0)
 backlog 0b 0p requeues 0
qdisc tbf 10: parent 1:1 rate 50Mbit burst 1537b lat 50ms
 Sent 37766372 bytes 24974 pkt (dropped 327, overlimits 96017 requeues 0)
 backlog 0b 0p requeues 0

tbf segments the GSO SKBs (tbf_segment) and updates the netem's 'qlen'.
The interface fully stops transferring packets and ""locks"". In this case,
the child qdisc and tfifo are empty, but 'qlen' indicates the tfifo is at
its limit and no more packets are accepted.

This patch adds a counter for the entries in the tfifo. Netem's 'qlen' is
only decreased when a packet is returned by its dequeue function, and not
during enqueuing into the child qdisc. External updates to 'qlen' are thus
accounted for and only the behavior of the backlog statistics changes. As
in other qdiscs, 'qlen' then keeps track of  how many packets are held in
netem and all of its children. As before, sch->limit remains as the
maximum number of packets in the tfifo. The same applies to netem's
backlog statistics."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

nfsd: fix nfs4_openowner leak when concurrent nfsd4_open occur

The action force umount(umount -f) will attempt to kill all rpc_task even
umount operation may ultimately fail if some files remain open.
Consequently, if an action attempts to open a file, it can potentially
send two rpc_task to nfs server.

    nfs4_run_open_task
     /* rpc_task2 */
     rpc_run_task

While processing an open request, nfsd will first attempt to find or
allocate an nfs4_openowner. If it finds an nfs4_openowner that is not
marked as NFS4_OO_CONFIRMED, this nfs4_openowner will released. Since
two rpc_task can attempt to open the same file simultaneously from the
client to server, and because two instances of nfsd can run
concurrently, this situation can lead to lots of memory leak.
Additionally, when we echo 0 to /proc/fs/nfsd/threads, warning will be
triggered.

quota: flush quota_release_work upon quota writeback

One of the paths quota writeback is called from is:

freeze_super()
  sync_filesystem()
    ext4_sync_fs()
      dquot_writeback_dquots()

Since we currently don't always flush the quota_release_work queue in
this path, we can end up with the following race:

 1. dquot are added to releasing_dquots list during regular operations.
 2. FS Freeze starts, however, this does not flush the quota_release_work queue.
 3. Freeze completes.
 4. Kernel eventually tries to flush the workqueue while FS is frozen which
    hits a WARN_ON since transaction gets started during frozen state:

  ext4_journal_check_start+0x28/0x110 [ext4] (unreliable)

  ext4_release_dquot+0x90/0x1d0 [ext4]
  quota_release_workfn+0x43c/0x4d0

Which is the following line:

  WARN_ON(sb->s_writers.frozen == SB_FREEZE_COMPLETE);

Which ultimately results in generic/390 failing due to dmesg
noise. This was detected on powerpc machine 15 cores.

To avoid this, make sure to flush the workqueue during
dquot_writeback_dquots() so we dont have any pending workitems after

Convert the SoC code to platform driver and instantiate a platform device

Likelihood: Moderate – The attacker will first have to abuse a code execution or file inclusion vulnerability (for example by using <redacted>.sh) to gain access to the <redacted>.json file, or obtain a firmware dump of the charging station or obtain the firmware via other channels.

Impact: Critical – All chargers using Iocharger firmware for AC models started with the same initial password. For models with firmware version before 25010801 a password change was not mandatory. It is therefore very likely that this firmware password is still active on many chargers.

This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC models before version 24120701.

Likelihood: High – Given the prevalence of these buffer overflows, and the clear error message of the web server, an attacker is very likely to be able to find these vulnerabilities.

Impact: Low – Usually, overflowing one of these buffers just causes a segmentation fault of the CGI binary, which causes the web server to return a 502 Bad Gateway error. However the webserver itself is not affected, and no DoS can be achieved.

Prior to 0.6.0, the project's provided HTTP client's local JWK Set cache should do a full replacement when the goroutine refreshes the remote JWK Set. The current behavior is to overwrite or append. This is a security issue for use cases that utilize the provided auto-caching HTTP client and where key removal from a JWK Set is equivalent to revocation. The affected auto-caching HTTP client was added in version v0.5.0 and fixed in v0.6.0. The only workaround would be to remove the provided auto-caching HTTP client and replace it with a custom implementation. This involves setting the HTTPClientStorageOptions.RefreshInterval to zero (or not specifying the value).

This issue affects iBGP and eBGP.

This issue affects IPv4 and IPv6.

An indicator of compromise may be the presence of malformed update messages in a neighboring AS which is unaffected by this issue:

For example, by issuing the command on the neighboring device:

CVE-2025-22151	2025-01-09T19:15:20.410	2025-01-09T19:15:20.410	Strawberry GraphQL is a library for creating GraphQL APIs. Starting in 0.182.0 and prior to version 0.257.0, a type confusion vulnerability exists in Strawberry GraphQL's relay integration that affects multiple ORM integrations (Django, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic). The vulnerability occurs when multiple GraphQL types are mapped to the same underlying model while using the relay node interface. When querying for a specific type using the global node field (e.g., FruitType:some-id), the resolver may incorrectly return an instance of a different type mapped to the same model (e.g., SpecialFruitType). This can lead to information disclosure if the alternate type exposes sensitive fields and potential privilege escalation if the alternate type contains data intended for restricted access.

Commit 8f9ea86fdf99b added some logic to sched_setaffinity that included
a WARN when a per-task affinity assignment races with a cpuset update.

Specifically, we can have a race where a cpuset update results in the
task affinity no longer being a subset of the cpuset. That's fine; we
have a fallback to instead use the cpuset mask. However, we have a WARN
set up that will trigger if the cpuset mask has no overlap at all with
the requested task affinity. This shouldn't be a warning condition; its
trivial to create this condition.

Reproduced the warning by the following setup:

amdgpu_ib_free(ring->adev, ...) will be called, which would crash the

because the device is actually not used in this function.

bpf: Prevent tailcall infinite loop caused by freplace

There is a potential infinite loop issue that can occur when using a
combination of tail calls and freplace.

In an upcoming selftest, the attach target for entry_freplace of
tailcall_freplace.c is subprog_tc of tc_bpf2bpf.c, while the tail call in
entry_freplace leads to entry_tc. This results in an infinite loop:

entry_tc -> subprog_tc -> entry_freplace --tailcall-> entry_tc.

The problem arises because the tail_call_cnt in entry_freplace resets to
zero each time entry_freplace is executed, causing the tail call mechanism
to never terminate, eventually leading to a kernel panic.

To fix this issue, the solution is twofold:

1. Prevent updating a program extended by an freplace program to a
   prog_array map.
2. Prevent extending a program that is already part of a prog_array map
   with an freplace program.

This ensures that:

* If a program or its subprogram has been extended by an freplace program,
  it can no longer be updated to a prog_array map.
* If a program has been added to a prog_array map, neither it nor its
  subprograms can be extended by an freplace program.

Moreover, an extension program should not be tailcalled. As such, return
-EINVAL if the program has a type of BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT when adding it to a
prog_array map.

Additionally, fix a minor code style issue by replacing eight spaces with a
tab for proper formatting."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

is that a resource name could be a non printable bytearray and we cannot

ipvs: fix UB due to uninitialized stack access in ip_vs_protocol_init()

Under certain kernel configurations when building with Clang/LLVM, the
compiler does not generate a return or jump as the terminator
instruction for ip_vs_protocol_init(), triggering the following objtool
warning during build time:

  vmlinux.o: warning: objtool: ip_vs_protocol_init() falls through to next function __initstub__kmod_ip_vs_rr__935_123_ip_vs_rr_init6()

At runtime, this either causes an oops when trying to load the ipvs
module or a boot-time panic if ipvs is built-in. This same issue has
been reported by the Intel kernel test robot previously.

Digging deeper into both LLVM and the kernel code reveals this to be a
undefined behavior problem. ip_vs_protocol_init() uses a on-stack buffer
of 64 chars to store the registered protocol names and leaves it
uninitialized after definition. The function calls strnlen() when
concatenating protocol names into the buffer. With CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE
strnlen() performs an extra step to check whether the last byte of the
input char buffer is a null character (commit 3009f891bb9f (""fortify:
Allow strlen() and strnlen() to pass compile-time known lengths"")).
This, together with possibly other configurations, cause the following
IR to be generated:

  define hidden i32 @ip_vs_protocol_init() local_unnamed_addr #5 section "".init.text"" align 16 !kcfi_type !29 {
    %1 = alloca [64 x i8], align 16
    ...

  14:                                               ; preds = %11
    %15 = getelementptr inbounds i8, ptr %1, i64 63
    %16 = load i8, ptr %15, align 1
    %17 = tail call i1 @llvm.is.constant.i8(i8 %16)
    %18 = icmp eq i8 %16, 0
    %19 = select i1 %17, i1 %18, i1 false
    br i1 %19, label %20, label %23

  20:                                               ; preds = %14
    %21 = call i64 @strlen(ptr noundef nonnull dereferenceable(1) %1) #23
    ...

  23:                                               ; preds = %14, %11, %20
    %24 = call i64 @strnlen(ptr noundef nonnull dereferenceable(1) %1, i64 noundef 64) #24
    ...
  }

The above code calculates the address of the last char in the buffer
(value %15) and then loads from it (value %16). Because the buffer is
never initialized, the LLVM GVN pass marks value %16 as undefined:

  %13 = getelementptr inbounds i8, ptr %1, i64 63
  br i1 undef, label %14, label %17

This gives later passes (SCCP, in particular) more DCE opportunities by
propagating the undef value further, and eventually removes everything
after the load on the uninitialized stack location:

  define hidden i32 @ip_vs_protocol_init() local_unnamed_addr #0 section "".init.text"" align 16 !kcfi_type !11 {
    %1 = alloca [64 x i8], align 16

If the full path to be built by ceph_mdsc_build_path() happens to be

rather useless and harmful to me.  Let's remove it and fail with

Because the inode bitmap is corrupted, an inode with an inode number that

underflow of i_nlink in rmdir operations.

The inode is used twice by the same task to unmount and remove directories

Avoid to this issue, check i_nlink in nilfs_iget(), if it is 0, it means
that this inode has been deleted, and iput is executed to reclaim it.

CVE-2024-55642	2025-01-11T13:15:27.990	2025-10-01T20:17:24.540	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: Prevent potential deadlocks in zone write plug error recovery

Zone write plugging for handling writes to zones of a zoned block
device always execute a zone report whenever a write BIO to a zone
fails. The intent of this is to ensure that the tracking of a zone write
pointer is always correct to ensure that the alignment to a zone write
pointer of write BIOs can be checked on submission and that we can
always correctly emulate zone append operations using regular write
BIOs.

However, this error recovery scheme introduces a potential deadlock if a
device queue freeze is initiated while BIOs are still plugged in a zone
write plug and one of these write operation fails. In such case, the
disk zone write plug error recovery work is scheduled and executes a
report zone. This in turn can result in a request allocation in the
underlying driver to issue the report zones command to the device. But
with the device queue freeze already started, this allocation will
block, preventing the report zone execution and the continuation of the
processing of the plugged BIOs. As plugged BIOs hold a queue usage
reference, the queue freeze itself will never complete, resulting in a
deadlock.

Avoid this problem by completely removing from the zone write plugging
code the use of report zones operations after a failed write operation,
instead relying on the device user to either execute a report zones,
reset the zone, finish the zone, or give up writing to the device (which
is a fairly common pattern for file systems which degrade to read-only
after write failures). This is not an unreasonnable requirement as all
well-behaved applications, FSes and device mapper already use report
zones to recover from write errors whenever possible by comparing the
current position of a zone write pointer with what their assumption
about the position is.

The changes to remove the automatic error recovery are as follows:
 - Completely remove the error recovery work and its associated
   resources (zone write plug list head, disk error list, and disk
   zone_wplugs_work work struct). This also removes the functions
   disk_zone_wplug_set_error() and disk_zone_wplug_clear_error().

 - Change the BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_ERROR zone write plug flag into
   BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE. This new flag is set for a zone write
   plug whenever a write opration targetting the zone of the zone write
   plug fails. This flag indicates that the zone write pointer offset is
   not reliable and that it must be updated when the next report zone,
   reset zone, finish zone or disk revalidation is executed.

 - Modify blk_zone_write_plug_bio_endio() to set the
   BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE flag for the target zone of a failed
   write BIO.

 - Modify the function disk_zone_wplug_set_wp_offset() to clear this
   new flag, thus implementing recovery of a correct write pointer
   offset with the reset (all) zone and finish zone operations.

 - Modify blkdev_report_zones() to always use the disk_report_zones_cb()
   callback so that disk_zone_wplug_sync_wp_offset() can be called for
   any zone marked with the BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE flag.
   This implements recovery of a correct write pointer offset for zone
   write plugs marked with BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE and within
   the range of the report zones operation executed by the user.

 - Modify blk_revalidate_seq_zone() to call
   disk_zone_wplug_sync_wp_offset() for all sequential write required
   zones when a zoned block device is revalidated, thus always resolving
   any inconsistency between the write pointer offset of zone write
   plugs and the actual write pointer position of sequential zones."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Drivers: hv: util: Avoid accessing a ringbuffer not initialized yet

If the KVP (or VSS) daemon starts before the VMBus channel's ringbuffer is
fully initialized, we can hit the panic below:

 kvp_register_done
 hvt_op_read

 __x64_sys_read

This can happen because the KVP/VSS channel callback can be invoked
even before the channel is fully opened:
1) as soon as hv_kvp_init() -> hvutil_transport_init() creates
/dev/vmbus/hv_kvp, the kvp daemon can open the device file immediately and
register itself to the driver by writing a message KVP_OP_REGISTER1 to the
file (which is handled by kvp_on_msg() ->kvp_handle_handshake()) and
reading the file for the driver's response, which is handled by
hvt_op_read(), which calls hvt->on_read(), i.e. kvp_register_done().

2) the problem with kvp_register_done() is that it can cause the
channel callback to be called even before the channel is fully opened,
and when the channel callback is starting to run, util_probe()->
vmbus_open() may have not initialized the ringbuffer yet, so the
callback can hit the panic of NULL pointer dereference.

To reproduce the panic consistently, we can add a ""ssleep(10)"" for KVP in
__vmbus_open(), just before the first hv_ringbuffer_init(), and then we
unload and reload the driver hv_utils, and run the daemon manually within
the 10 seconds.

Fix the panic by reordering the steps in util_probe() so the char dev
entry used by the KVP or VSS daemon is not created until after
vmbus_open() has completed. This reordering prevents the race condition
from happening."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

net: ethernet: oa_tc6: fix tx skb race condition between reference pointers

There are two skb pointers to manage tx skb's enqueued from n/w stack.
waiting_tx_skb pointer points to the tx skb which needs to be processed
and ongoing_tx_skb pointer points to the tx skb which is being processed.

SPI thread prepares the tx data chunks from the tx skb pointed by the
ongoing_tx_skb pointer. When the tx skb pointed by the ongoing_tx_skb is
processed, the tx skb pointed by the waiting_tx_skb is assigned to
ongoing_tx_skb and the waiting_tx_skb pointer is assigned with NULL.
Whenever there is a new tx skb from n/w stack, it will be assigned to
waiting_tx_skb pointer if it is NULL. Enqueuing and processing of a tx skb
handled in two different threads.

Consider a scenario where the SPI thread processed an ongoing_tx_skb and
it moves next tx skb from waiting_tx_skb pointer to ongoing_tx_skb pointer
without doing any NULL check. At this time, if the waiting_tx_skb pointer
is NULL then ongoing_tx_skb pointer is also assigned with NULL. After
that, if a new tx skb is assigned to waiting_tx_skb pointer by the n/w
stack and there is a chance to overwrite the tx skb pointer with NULL in
the SPI thread. Finally one of the tx skb will be left as unhandled,
resulting packet missing and memory leak.

- Consider the below scenario where the TXC reported from the previous
transfer is 10 and ongoing_tx_skb holds an tx ethernet frame which can be
transported in 20 TXCs and waiting_tx_skb is still NULL.
	tx_credits = 10; /* 21 are filled in the previous transfer */
	ongoing_tx_skb = 20;
	waiting_tx_skb = NULL; /* Still NULL */
- So, (tc6->ongoing_tx_skb || tc6->waiting_tx_skb) becomes true.
- After oa_tc6_prepare_spi_tx_buf_for_tx_skbs()
	ongoing_tx_skb = 10;
	waiting_tx_skb = NULL; /* Still NULL */
- Perform SPI transfer.
- Process SPI rx buffer to get the TXC from footers.
- Now let's assume previously filled 21 TXCs are freed so we are good to
transport the next remaining 10 tx chunks from ongoing_tx_skb.
	tx_credits = 21;
	ongoing_tx_skb = 10;
	waiting_tx_skb = NULL;
- So, (tc6->ongoing_tx_skb || tc6->waiting_tx_skb) becomes true again.
- In the oa_tc6_prepare_spi_tx_buf_for_tx_skbs()
	ongoing_tx_skb = NULL;
	waiting_tx_skb = NULL;

				- if ongoing_tx_skb is NULL
				- ongoing_tx_skb = waiting_tx_skb
- waiting_tx_skb = skb
				- waiting_tx_skb = NULL
				...
				- ongoing_tx_skb = NULL
- if waiting_tx_skb is NULL
- waiting_tx_skb = skb

To overcome the above issue, protect the moving of tx skb reference from
waiting_tx_skb pointer to ongoing_tx_skb pointer and assigning new tx skb
to waiting_tx_skb pointer, so that the other thread can't access the
waiting_tx_skb pointer until the current thread completes moving the tx
skb reference safely."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

PCI: imx6: Fix suspend/resume support on i.MX6QDL

The suspend/resume functionality is currently broken on the i.MX6QDL
platform, as documented in the NXP errata (ERR005723):

  https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/errata/IMX6DQCE.pdf

This patch addresses the issue by sharing most of the suspend/resume
sequences used by other i.MX devices, while avoiding modifications to
critical registers that disrupt the PCIe functionality. It targets the
same problem as the following downstream commit:

  https://github.com/nxp-imx/linux-imx/commit/4e92355e1f79d225ea842511fcfd42b343b32995

Unlike the downstream commit, this patch also resets the connected PCIe
device if possible. Without this reset, certain drivers, such as ath10k
or iwlwifi, will crash on resume. The device reset is also done by the
driver on other i.MX platforms, making this patch consistent with
existing practices.

Upon resuming, the kernel will hang and display an error. Here's an
example of the error encountered with the ath10k driver:

  ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: Unable to change power state from D3hot to D0, device inaccessible
  Unhandled fault: imprecise external abort (0x1406) at 0x0106f944

Without this patch, suspend/resume will fail on i.MX6QDL devices if a
PCIe device is connected.

s390/entry: Mark IRQ entries to fix stack depot warnings

The stack depot filters out everything outside of the top interrupt
context as an uninteresting or irrelevant part of the stack traces. This
helps with stack trace de-duplication, avoiding an explosion of saved
stack traces that share the same IRQ context code path but originate
from different randomly interrupted points, eventually exhausting the
stack depot.

Filtering uses in_irqentry_text() to identify functions within the
.irqentry.text and .softirqentry.text sections, which then become the
last stack trace entries being saved.

While __do_softirq() is placed into the .softirqentry.text section by
common code, populating .irqentry.text is architecture-specific.

Currently, the .irqentry.text section on s390 is empty, which prevents
stack depot filtering and de-duplication and could result in warnings
like:

Stack depot reached limit capacity
WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 286113 at lib/stackdepot.c:252 depot_alloc_stack+0x39a/0x3c8

with PREEMPT and KASAN enabled.

Fix this by moving the IO/EXT interrupt handlers from .kprobes.text into
the .irqentry.text section and updating the kprobes blacklist to include
the .irqentry.text section.

This is done only for asynchronous interrupts and explicitly not for
program checks, which are synchronous and where the context beyond the
program check is important to preserve. Despite machine checks being
somewhat in between, they are extremely rare, and preserving context
when possible is also of value.

SVCs and Restart Interrupts are not relevant, one being always at the
boundary to user space and the other being a one-time thing.

IRQ entries filtering is also optionally used in ftrace function graph,

arm64: ptrace: fix partial SETREGSET for NT_ARM_TAGGED_ADDR_CTRL

Currently tagged_addr_ctrl_set() doesn't initialize the temporary 'ctrl'
variable, and a SETREGSET call with a length of zero will leave this
uninitialized. Consequently tagged_addr_ctrl_set() will consume an
arbitrary value, potentially leaking up to 64 bits of memory from the
kernel stack. The read is limited to a specific slot on the stack, and
the issue does not provide a write mechanism.

As set_tagged_addr_ctrl() only accepts values where bits [63:4] zero and
rejects other values, a partial SETREGSET attempt will randomly succeed
or fail depending on the value of the uninitialized value, and the
exposure is significantly limited.

Fix this by initializing the temporary value before copying the regset
from userspace, as for other regsets (e.g. NT_PRSTATUS, NT_PRFPREG,
NT_ARM_SYSTEM_CALL). In the case of a zero-length write, the existing
value of the tagged address ctrl will be retained.

The NT_ARM_TAGGED_ADDR_CTRL regset is only visible in the
user_aarch64_view used by a native AArch64 task to manipulate another
native AArch64 task. As get_tagged_addr_ctrl() only returns an error
value when called for a compat task, tagged_addr_ctrl_get() and
tagged_addr_ctrl_set() should never observe an error value from
get_tagged_addr_ctrl(). Add a WARN_ON_ONCE() to both to indicate that
such an error would be unexpected, and error handlnig is not missing in

CVE-2024-57876	2025-01-11T15:15:07.930	2025-09-26T20:19:44.470	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/dp_mst: Fix resetting msg rx state after topology removal

If the MST topology is removed during the reception of an MST down reply
or MST up request sideband message, the
drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr::up_req_recv/down_rep_recv states could be reset
from one thread via drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_set_mst(false), racing with
the reading/parsing of the message from another thread via
drm_dp_mst_handle_down_rep() or drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req(). The race is
possible since the reader/parser doesn't hold any lock while accessing
the reception state. This in turn can lead to a memory corruption in the
reader/parser as described by commit bd2fccac61b4 (""drm/dp_mst: Fix MST
sideband message body length check"").

Fix the above by resetting the message reception state if needed before
reading/parsing a message. Another solution would be to hold the
drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr::lock for the whole duration of the message
reception/parsing in drm_dp_mst_handle_down_rep() and
drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req(), however this would require a bigger change.
Since the fix is also needed for stable, opting for the simpler solution
in this patch."	7.0	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

arm64: ptrace: fix partial SETREGSET for NT_ARM_POE

Currently poe_set() doesn't initialize the temporary 'ctrl' variable,
and a SETREGSET call with a length of zero will leave this
uninitialized. Consequently an arbitrary value will be written back to
target->thread.por_el0, potentially leaking up to 64 bits of memory from
the kernel stack. The read is limited to a specific slot on the stack,
and the issue does not provide a write mechanism.

Fix this by initializing the temporary value before copying the regset
from userspace, as for other regsets (e.g. NT_PRSTATUS, NT_PRFPREG,
NT_ARM_SYSTEM_CALL). In the case of a zero-length write, the existing
contents of POR_EL1 will be retained.

Due to an access validation issue that affects Apache CloudStack versions from 4.16.0, users who have access, prior access or knowledge of resource UUIDs can list and add comments (annotations) to such resources. 

An attacker with a user-account and access or prior knowledge of resource UUIDs may exploit this issue to read contents of the comments (annotations) or add malicious comments (annotations) to such resources. 

This may cause potential loss of confidentiality of CloudStack environments and resources if the comments (annotations) contain any privileged information. However, guessing or brute-forcing resource UUIDs are generally hard to impossible and access to listing or adding comments isn't same as access to CloudStack resources, making this issue of very low severity and general low impact.


CloudStack admins may also disallow listAnnotations and addAnnotation API access to non-admin roles in their environment as an interim measure."	4.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

A user with admincp.core.emails or admincp.users.edit permissions can validate users and an attacker can reset their password. When the account is successfully approved by email the reset code is NULL, but when the account is manually validated by a user with admincp.core.emails or admincp.users.edit permissions then the reset_code will no longer be NULL but empty. An attacker can request http://localhost/nameless/index.php?route=/forgot_password/&c= and reset the password. As a result an attacker may compromise another users password and take over their account. This issue has been addressed in release version 2.1.3 and all users are advised to upgrade.

In Patch 9.1.1003 Vim will correctly reset the visual mode before opening other windows and buffers and therefore fix this bug. In addition it does verify that it won't try to access a position if the position is greater than the corresponding buffer line. Impact is medium since the user must have switched on visual mode when executing the :all ex command. The Vim project would like to thank github user gandalf4a for reporting this issue.

The issue was identified during Quarkslab's security audit on the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) based revocation check feature.
After retrieving the CRL, notation-go attempts to update the CRL cache using the os.Rename method. However, this operation may fail due to operating system-specific limitations, particularly when the source and destination paths are on different mount points. This failure could lead to an unexpected program termination. In method `crl.(*FileCache).Set`, a temporary file is created in the OS dedicated area (like /tmp for, usually, Linux/Unix). The file is written and then it is tried to move it to the dedicated `notation` cache directory thanks `os.Rename`. As specified in Go documentation, OS specific restriction may apply. When used with Linux OS, it is relying on rename syscall from the libc and as per the documentation, moving a file to a different mountpoint raises an EXDEV error, interpreted as Cross device link not permitted error. Some Linux distribution, like RedHat use a dedicated filesystem (tmpfs), mounted on a specific mountpoint (usually /tmp) for temporary files. When using such OS, revocation check based on CRL will repeatedly crash notation. As a result the signature verification process is aborted as process crashes. This issue has been addressed in version 1.3.0-rc.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."	3.3	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L		
CVE-2024-56138	2025-01-13T22:15:14.313	2025-01-13T22:15:14.313	notion-go is a collection of libraries for supporting sign and verify OCI artifacts. Based on Notary Project specifications. This issue was identified during Quarkslab's audit of the timestamp feature. During the timestamp signature generation, the revocation status of the certificate(s) used to generate the timestamp signature was not verified. During timestamp signature generation, notation-go did not check the revocation status of the certificate chain used by the TSA. This oversight creates a vulnerability that could be exploited through a Man-in-The-Middle attack. An attacker could potentially use a compromised, intermediate, or revoked leaf certificate to generate a malicious countersignature, which would then be accepted and stored by `notation`. This could lead to denial of service scenarios, particularly in CI/CD environments during signature verification processes because timestamp signature would fail due to the presence of a revoked certificate(s) potentially disrupting operations. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.3.0-rc.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	4.0	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

CVE-2024-12085	2025-01-14T18:15:25.123	2025-08-12T21:15:27.327	A flaw was found in rsync which could be triggered when rsync compares file checksums. This flaw allows an attacker to manipulate the checksum length (s2length) to cause a comparison between a checksum and uninitialized memory and leak one byte of uninitialized stack data at a time.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2024-12086	2025-01-14T18:15:25.297	2025-06-20T18:40:03.263	A flaw was found in rsync. It could allow a server to enumerate the contents of an arbitrary file from the client's machine. This issue occurs when files are being copied from a client to a server. During this process, the rsync server will send checksums of local data to the client to compare with in order to determine what data needs to be sent to the server. By sending specially constructed checksum values for arbitrary files, an attacker may be able to reconstruct the data of those files byte-by-byte based on the responses from the client.	6.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2024-12087	2025-01-14T18:15:25.467	2025-08-12T21:15:27.770	A path traversal vulnerability exists in rsync. It stems from behavior enabled by the `--inc-recursive` option, a default-enabled option for many client options and can be enabled by the server even if not explicitly enabled by the client. When using the `--inc-recursive` option, a lack of proper symlink verification coupled with deduplication checks occurring on a per-file-list basis could allow a server to write files outside of the client's intended destination directory. A malicious server could write malicious files to arbitrary locations named after valid directories/paths on the client.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2024-12088	2025-01-14T18:15:25.643	2025-08-12T21:15:28.007	A flaw was found in rsync. When using the `--safe-links` option, the rsync client fails to properly verify if a symbolic link destination sent from the server contains another symbolic link within it. This results in a path traversal vulnerability, which may lead to arbitrary file write outside the desired directory.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2024-12747	2025-01-14T18:15:25.830	2025-06-02T15:15:27.937	A flaw was found in rsync. This vulnerability arises from a race condition during rsync's handling of symbolic links. Rsync's default behavior when encountering symbolic links is to skip them. If an attacker replaced a regular file with a symbolic link at the right time, it was possible to bypass the default behavior and traverse symbolic links. Depending on the privileges of the rsync process, an attacker could leak sensitive information, potentially leading to privilege escalation.	5.6	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVE-2025-21607	2025-01-14T18:16:05.490	2025-04-24T15:15:57.293	Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the EVM. When the Vyper Compiler uses the precompiles EcRecover (0x1) and Identity (0x4), the success flag of the call is not checked. As a consequence an attacker can provide a specific amount of gas to make these calls fail but let the overall execution continue. Then the execution result can be incorrect. Based on EVM's rules, after the failed precompile the remaining code has only 1/64 of the pre-call-gas left (as 63/64 were forwarded and spent). Hence, only fairly simple executions can follow the failed precompile calls. Therefore, we found no significantly impacted real-world contracts. None the less an advisory has been made out of an abundance of caution. This issue is fixed in 0.4.1.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2025-23025	2025-01-14T18:16:05.650	2025-05-13T13:34:05.930	XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. NOTE: The Realtime WYSIWYG Editor extension was **experimental**, and thus **not recommended**, in the versions affected by this vulnerability. It has become enabled by default, and thus recommended, starting with XWiki 16.9.0. A user with only **edit right** can join a realtime editing session where others, that where already there or that may join later, have **script** or **programming** access rights. This user can then insert **script rendering macros** that are executed for those users in the realtime session that have script or programming rights. The inserted scripts can be used to gain more access rights. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.10.2, 16.4.1 and 16.6.0-rc-1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may either disable the realtime WYSIWYG editing by disabling the ``xwiki-realtime`` CKEditor plugin from the WYSIWYG editor administration section or uninstall the Realtime WYSIWYG Editorextension (org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-realtime-wysiwyg-ui).	9.0	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

A vulnerability has been identified in Rasa that enables an attacker who has the ability to load a maliciously crafted model remotely into a Rasa instance to achieve Remote Code Execution. The prerequisites for this are: 1. The HTTP API must be enabled on the Rasa instance eg with `--enable-api`. This is not the default configuration. 2. For unauthenticated RCE to be exploitable, the user must not have configured any authentication or other security controls recommended in our documentation. 3. For authenticated RCE, the attacker must posses a valid authentication token or JWT to interact with the Rasa API. This issue has been addressed in rasa version 3.6.21 and all users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that they require authentication and that only trusted users are given access.	9.0	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2024-50338	2025-01-14T19:15:31.967	2025-01-14T19:15:31.967	Git Credential Manager (GCM) is a secure Git credential helper built on .NET that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The Git credential protocol is text-based over standard input/output, and consists of a series of lines of key-value pairs in the format `key=value`. Git's documentation restricts the use of the NUL (`\0`) character and newlines to form part of the keys or values. When Git reads from standard input, it considers both LF and CRLF as newline characters for the credential protocol by virtue of calling `strbuf_getline` that calls to `strbuf_getdelim_strip_crlf`. Git also validates that a newline is not present in the value by checking for the presence of the line-feed character (LF, `\n`), and errors if this is the case. This captures both LF and CRLF-type newlines. Git Credential Manager uses the .NET standard library `StreamReader` class to read the standard input stream line-by-line and parse the `key=value` credential protocol format. The implementation of the `ReadLineAsync` method considers LF, CRLF, and CR as valid line endings. This is means that .NET considers a single CR as a valid newline character, whereas Git does not. This mismatch of newline treatment between Git and GCM means that an attacker can craft a malicious remote URL. When a user clones or otherwise interacts with a malicious repository that requires authentication, the attacker can capture credentials for another Git remote. The attack is also heightened when cloning from repositories with submodules when using the `--recursive` clone option as the user is not able to inspect the submodule remote URLs beforehand. This issue has been patched in version 2.6.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should only interact with trusted remote repositories, and not clone with `--recursive` to allow inspection of any submodule URLs before cloning those submodules.	7.4	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2024-50349	2025-01-14T19:15:32.157	2025-01-21T17:15:14.287	Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When Git asks for credentials via a terminal prompt (i.e. without using any credential helper), it prints out the host name for which the user is expected to provide a username and/or a password. At this stage, any URL-encoded parts have been decoded already, and are printed verbatim. This allows attackers to craft URLs that contain ANSI escape sequences that the terminal interpret to confuse users e.g. into providing passwords for trusted Git hosting sites when in fact they are then sent to untrusted sites that are under the attacker's control. This issue has been patch via commits `7725b81` and `c903985` which are included in release versions v2.48.1, v2.47.2, v2.46.3, v2.45.3, v2.44.3, v2.43.6, v2.42.4, v2.41.3, and v2.40.4. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid cloning from untrusted URLs, especially recursive clones.					
CVE-2024-52006	2025-01-14T19:15:32.330	2025-01-21T17:15:14.423	Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. Git defines a line-based protocol that is used to exchange information between Git and Git credential helpers. Some ecosystems (most notably, .NET and node.js) interpret single Carriage Return characters as newlines, which renders the protections against CVE-2020-5260 incomplete for credential helpers that treat Carriage Returns in this way. This issue has been addressed in commit `b01b9b8` which is included in release versions v2.48.1, v2.47.2, v2.46.3, v2.45.3, v2.44.3, v2.43.6, v2.42.4, v2.41.3, and v2.40.4.

Importantly, these constraints are actually required to be true in DER, but that correctness wasn't enforced on the early node parser side so it was incorrect to rely on it later on in decoding, which is what the library did.

These crashes can be triggered when parsing any DER/BER format object. There is no memory-safety issue here: the crash is a graceful one from the Swift runtime.

This issue occurs because the skb buffer is too small, and it's actual
allocation is aligned. This hides an actual issue, which is that nr_route_frame
does not validate the buffer size before using it.

Fix this issue by checking skb->len before accessing any fields in skb->data.

The issue may be triggered by damon, offline_page, page_idle, etc, which
will increase the refcount of page table.

1. The page table itself will be discarded after reporting the
   ""nonzero mapcount"".

2. The HugeTLB page mapped by the page table miss freeing since we
   treat the page table as shared and a shared page table will not be
   unmapped.

Fix it by introducing independent PMD page table shared count.  As
described by comment, pt_index/pt_mm/pt_frag_refcount are used for s390

In allow_direct_reclaim(), while processing ZONE_DMA32, the sum of
inactive/active file-backed pages calculated in zone_reclaimable_pages()
based on the result of zone_page_state_snapshot() is zero.  

Additionally, since this system lacks swap, the calculation of inactive/
active anonymous pages is skipped.

        crash> p nr_swap_pages
        nr_swap_pages = $1937 = {
          counter = 0
        }

As a result, ZONE_DMA32 is deemed unreclaimable and skipped, moving on to
the processing of the next zone, ZONE_NORMAL, despite ZONE_DMA32 having
free pages significantly exceeding the high watermark.

The problem is that the pgdat->kswapd_failures hasn't been incremented.

        crash> px ((struct pglist_data *) 0xffff00817fffe540)->kswapd_failures
        $1935 = 0x0

This is because the node deemed balanced.  The node balancing logic in
balance_pgdat() evaluates all zones collectively.  If one or more zones
(e.g., ZONE_DMA32) have enough free pages to meet their watermarks, the
entire node is deemed balanced.  This causes balance_pgdat() to exit early
before incrementing the kswapd_failures, as it considers the overall
memory state acceptable, even though some zones (like ZONE_NORMAL) remain
under significant pressure.


The patch ensures that zone_reclaimable_pages() includes free pages
(NR_FREE_PAGES) in its calculation when no other reclaimable pages are
available (e.g., file-backed or anonymous pages).  This change prevents
zones like ZONE_DMA32, which have sufficient free pages, from being
mistakenly deemed unreclaimable.  By doing so, the patch ensures proper
node balancing, avoids masking pressure on other zones like ZONE_NORMAL,
and prevents infinite loops in throttle_direct_reclaim() caused by
allow_direct_reclaim(pgdat) repeatedly returning false.


The kernel hangs due to a task stuck in throttle_direct_reclaim(), caused
by a node being incorrectly deemed balanced despite pressure in certain
zones, such as ZONE_NORMAL.  This issue arises from
zone_reclaimable_pages

%pS and %pK, in the same back trace line, are redundant, and %pS can void
%pK service in certain contexts.

%pS alone already provides the necessary information, and if it cannot
resolve the symbol, it falls back to printing the raw address voiding
the original intent behind the %pK.

Additionally, %pK requires a privilege check CAP_SYSLOG enforced through
the LSM, which can trigger a ""sleeping function called from invalid

The intent of the verifcation done in check_flush_depedency is to ensure
forward progress during memory reclaim, by flagging cases when either a
memory reclaim process, or a memory reclaim work item is flushed from a
context not marked as memory reclaim safe.

This is correct when flushing, but when called from the
cancel(_delayed)_work_sync() paths it is a false positive because work is
either already running, or will not be running at all. Therefore
cancelling it is safe and we can relax the warning criteria by letting the
helper know of the calling context.

mcp23s08_irq_set_type() calls regmap_update_bits_base(), and the latter
locks the mutex.

However, __setup_irq() locks desc->lock spinlock before calling these
functions. As a result, the system tries to lock the mutex whole holding
the spinlock.

It seems, the internal regmap locks are not needed in this driver at all.
mcp->lock seems to protect the regmap from concurrent accesses already,
except, probably, in mcp_pinconf_get/set.

mcp23s08_irq_set_type() and mcp23s08_irq_mask/unmask() are called under
chip_bus_lock(), which calls mcp23s08_irq_bus_lock(). The latter takes
mcp->lock and enables regmap caching, so that the potentially slow I2C
accesses are deferred until chip_bus_unlock().

The accesses to the regmap from mcp23s08_probe_one() do not need additional
locking.

In all remaining places where the regmap is accessed, except
mcp_pinconf_get/set(), the driver already takes mcp->lock.

This patch adds locking in mcp_pinconf_get/set() and disables internal
locking in the regmap config. Among other things, it fixes the sleeping
in atomic context described above."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

RDMA/uverbs: Prevent integer overflow issue

In the expression ""cmd.wqe_size * cmd.wr_count"", both variables are u32
values that come from the user so the multiplication can lead to integer
wrapping.  Then we pass the result to uverbs_request_next_ptr() which also
could potentially wrap.  The ""cmd.sge_count * sizeof(struct ib_uverbs_sge)""
multiplication can also overflow on 32bit systems although it's fine on
64bit systems.

This patch does two things.  First, I've re-arranged the condition in
uverbs_request_next_ptr() so that the use controlled variable ""len"" is on
one side of the comparison by itself without any math.  Then I've modified
all the callers to use size_mul() for the multiplications."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

ocfs2: fix slab-use-after-free due to dangling pointer dqi_priv

When mounting ocfs2 and then remounting it as read-only, a
slab-use-after-free occurs after the user uses a syscall to
quota_getnextquota.  Specifically, sb_dqinfo(sb, type)->dqi_priv is the
dangling pointer.

During the remounting process, the pointer dqi_priv is freed but is never
set as null leaving it to be accessed.  Additionally, the read-only option
for remounting sets the DQUOT_SUSPENDED flag instead of setting the
DQUOT_USAGE_ENABLED flags.  Moreover, later in the process of getting the
next quota, the function ocfs2_get_next_id is called and only checks the
quota usage flags and not the quota suspended flags.

To fix this, I set dqi_priv to null when it is freed after remounting with
read-only and put a check for DQUOT_SUSPENDED in ocfs2_get_next_id.

btrfs: flush delalloc workers queue before stopping cleaner kthread during unmount

During the unmount path, at close_ctree(), we first stop the cleaner
kthread, using kthread_stop() which frees the associated task_struct, and
then stop and destroy all the work queues. However after we stopped the
cleaner we may still have a worker from the delalloc_workers queue running
inode.c:submit_compressed_extents(), which calls btrfs_add_delayed_iput(),
which in turn tries to wake up the cleaner kthread - which was already
destroyed before, resulting in a use-after-free on the task_struct.

Before finialize this solution, there're some discussion on
the DMA mapping type(stream-based or coherent) in this KFD

in various cache sync policy of DMA sync. Therefore, in order to
simplify the DMA direction setting alignment, let's set the DMA map

CVE-2024-57898	2025-01-15T13:15:14.427	2025-01-15T13:15:14.427	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: cfg80211: clear link ID from bitmap during link delete after clean up

Currently, during link deletion, the link ID is first removed from the
valid_links bitmap before performing any clean-up operations. However, some
functions require the link ID to remain in the valid_links bitmap. One
such example is cfg80211_cac_event(). The flow is -

nl80211_remove_link()
    cfg80211_remove_link()
        ieee80211_del_intf_link()
            ieee80211_vif_set_links()
                ieee80211_vif_update_links()
                    ieee80211_link_stop()
                        cfg80211_cac_event()

cfg80211_cac_event() requires link ID to be present but it is cleared
already in cfg80211_remove_link(). Ultimately, WARN_ON() is hit.

Therefore, clear the link ID from the bitmap only after completing the link
clean-up."

wifi: mac80211: fix mbss changed flags corruption on 32 bit systems

On 32-bit systems, the size of an unsigned long is 4 bytes,
while a u64 is 8 bytes. Therefore, when using
or_each_set_bit(bit, &bits, sizeof(changed) * BITS_PER_BYTE),
the code is incorrectly searching for a bit in a 32-bit
variable that is expected to be 64 bits in size,
leading to incorrect bit finding.

Solution: Ensure that the size of the bits variable is correctly
adjusted for each architecture.

syzbot found a race in ila_add_mapping() [1]

commit 031ae72825ce (""ila: call nf_unregister_net_hooks() sooner"")
attempted to fix a similar issue.

Looking at the syzbot repro, we have concurrent ILA_CMD_ADD commands.

Add a mutex to make sure at most one thread is calling nf_register_net_hooks().

BIG TCP introduced an IPV6_TLV_JUMBO IPv6 extension header to
communicate packet length, as this is an IPv6 jumbogram. But, the
feature is only enabled on devices that support BIG TCP TSO. The
header is only present for PF_PACKET taps like tcpdump, and not
transmitted by physical devices.

For this specific case of extension headers that are not
transmitted, return to the situation before the blamed commit
and support hardware offload.

ipv6_has_hopopt_jumbo() tests not only whether this header is present,
but also that it is the only extension header before a terminal (L4)
header."

CVE-2025-23040	2025-01-15T18:15:24.797	2025-01-15T18:15:24.797	GitHub Desktop is an open-source Electron-based GitHub app designed for git development. An attacker convincing a user to clone a repository directly or through a submodule can allow the attacker access to the user's credentials through the use of maliciously crafted remote URL. GitHub Desktop relies on Git to perform all network related operations (such as cloning, fetching, and pushing). When a user attempts to clone a repository GitHub Desktop will invoke `git clone` and when Git encounters a remote which requires authentication it will request the credentials for that remote host from GitHub Desktop using the git-credential protocol. Using a maliciously crafted URL it's possible to cause the credential request coming from Git to be misinterpreted by Github Desktop such that it will send credentials for a different host than the host that Git is currently communicating with thereby allowing for secret exfiltration. GitHub username and OAuth token, or credentials for other Git remote hosts stored in GitHub Desktop could be improperly transmitted to an unrelated host. Users should update to GitHub Desktop 3.4.12 or greater which fixes this vulnerability. Users who suspect they may be affected should revoke any relevant credentials.	6.6	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

CVE-2024-36402	2025-01-16T20:15:32.047	2025-08-20T15:34:56.320	Matrix Media Repo (MMR) is a highly configurable multi-homeserver media repository for Matrix. MMR before version 1.3.5 allows, by design, unauthenticated remote participants to trigger a download and caching of remote media from a remote homeserver to the local media repository. Such content then also becomes available for download from the local homeserver in an unauthenticated way. The implication is that unauthenticated remote adversaries can use this functionality to plant problematic content into the media repository. MMR 1.3.5 introduces a partial mitigation in the form of new endpoints which require authentication for media downloads. The unauthenticated endpoints will be frozen in a future release, closing the attack vector. Though extremely limited, server operators can use more strict rate limits based on IP address as a partial workaround.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L		
CVE-2024-36403	2025-01-16T20:15:32.197	2025-08-20T15:19:29.360	"Matrix Media Repo (MMR) is a highly configurable multi-homeserver media repository for Matrix. MMR before version 1.3.5 is vulnerable to unbounded disk consumption, where an unauthenticated adversary can induce it to download and cache large amounts of remote media files. MMR's typical operating environment uses S3-like storage as a backend, with file-backed store as an alternative option. Instances using a file-backed store or those which self-host an S3 storage system are therefore vulnerable to a disk fill attack. Once the disk is full, authenticated users will be unable to upload new media, resulting in denial of service. For instances configured to use a cloud-based S3 storage option, this could result in high service fees instead of a denial of service. MMR 1.3.5 introduces a new default-on ""leaky bucket"" rate limit to reduce the amount of data a user can request at a time. This does not fully address the issue, but does limit an unauthenticated user's ability to request large amounts of data. Operators should note that the leaky bucket implementation introduced in MMR 1.3.5 requires the IP address associated with the request to be forwarded, to avoid mistakenly applying the rate limit to the reverse proxy instead. To avoid this issue, the reverse proxy should populate the X-Forwarded-For header when sending the request to MMR. Operators who cannot update may wish to lower the maximum file size they allow and implement harsh rate limits, though this can still lead to a large amount of data to be downloaded."	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

This violates the intended privilege hierarchy, enabling a non-root user to remove the highest-privileged account. Due to insufficient role checks, the `remove_user_from_org` function does not prevent an ""Admin"" user from removing a ""Root"" user. As a result, an attacker with an ""Admin"" role can remove critical ""Root"" users, potentially gaining effective full control by eliminating the highest-privileged accounts.

CVE-2024-56515	2025-01-16T20:15:33.197	2025-08-20T14:41:51.063	"Matrix Media Repo (MMR) is a highly configurable multi-homeserver media repository for Matrix. If SVG or JPEGXL thumbnailers are enabled (they are disabled by default), a user may upload a file which claims to be either of these types and request a thumbnail to invoke a different decoder in ImageMagick. In some ImageMagick installations, this includes the capability to run Ghostscript to decode the image/file. If MP4 thumbnailers are enabled (also disabled by default), the same issue as above may occur with the ffmpeg installation instead. MMR uses a number of other decoders for all other file types when preparing thumbnails. Theoretical issues are possible with these decoders, however in testing they were not possible to exploit. This is fixed in MMR v1.3.8. MMR now inspects the mimetype of media prior to thumbnailing, and picks a thumbnailer based on those results instead of relying on user-supplied values. This may lead to fewer thumbnails when obscure file shapes are used. This also helps narrow scope of theoretical issues with all decoders MMR uses for thumbnails. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable the SVG, JPEGXL, and MP4 thumbnail types in the MMR config which prevents the decoders from being invoked. Further disabling uncommon file types on the server is recommended to limit risk surface. Containers and other similar technologies may also be used to limit the impact of vulnerabilities in external decoders, like ImageMagick and ffmpeg. Some installations of ImageMagick may disable ""unsafe"" file types, like PDFs, already. This option can be replicated to other environments as needed. ffmpeg may be compiled with limited decoders/codecs. The Docker image for MMR disables PDFs and similar formats by default."	6.8	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVE-2025-21606	2025-01-17T21:15:11.420	2025-01-17T21:15:11.420	stats is a macOS system monitor in for the menu bar. The Stats application is vulnerable to a local privilege escalation due to the insecure implementation of its XPC service. The application registers a Mach service under the name `eu.exelban.Stats.SMC.Helper`. The associated binary, eu.exelban.Stats.SMC.Helper, is a privileged helper tool designed to execute actions requiring elevated privileges on behalf of the client, such as setting fan modes, adjusting fan speeds, and executing the `powermetrics` command. The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the `shouldAcceptNewConnection` method, which unconditionally returns YES (or true), allowing any XPC client to connect to the service without any form of verification. As a result, unauthorized clients can establish a connection to the Mach service and invoke methods exposed by the HelperTool interface. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to modify the hardware settings of the user’s device and execute arbitrary code with root privileges. This issue has been addressed in version 2.11.21 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

CVE-2025-23205	2025-01-17T21:15:11.850	2025-01-17T21:15:11.850	nbgrader is a system for assigning and grading notebooks. Enabling frame-ancestors: 'self' grants any JupyterHub user the ability to extract formgrader content by sending malicious links to users with access to formgrader, at least when using the default JupyterHub configuration of `enable_subdomains = False`. #1915 disables a protection which would allow user Alice to craft a page embedding formgrader in an IFrame. If Bob visits that page, his credentials will be sent and the formgrader page loaded. Because Alice's page is on the same Origin as the formgrader iframe, Javasript on Alice's page has _full access_ to the contents of the page served by formgrader using Bob's credentials. This issue has been addressed in release 0.9.5 and all users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable `frame-ancestors: self`, or enable per-user and per-service subdomains with `JupyterHub.enable_subdomains = True` (then even if embedding in an IFrame is allowed, the host page does not have access to the contents of the frame).					
CVE-2025-23206	2025-01-17T21:15:12.003	2025-09-19T18:45:13.100	The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open-source software development framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation. Users who use IAM OIDC custom resource provider package will download CA Thumbprints as part of the custom resource workflow. However, the current `tls.connect` method will always set `rejectUnauthorized: false` which is a potential security concern. CDK should follow the best practice and set `rejectUnauthorized: true`. However, this could be a breaking change for existing CDK applications and we should fix this with a feature flag. Note that this is marked as low severity Security advisory because the issuer url is provided by CDK users who define the CDK application. If they insist on connecting to a unauthorized OIDC provider, CDK should not disallow this. Additionally, the code block is run in a Lambda environment which mitigate the MITM attack. The patch is in progress. To mitigate, upgrade to CDK v2.177.0 (Expected release date 2025-02-22). Once upgraded, users should make sure the feature flag '@aws-cdk/aws-iam:oidcRejectUnauthorizedConnections' is set to true in `cdk.context.json` or `cdk.json`. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	8.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

CVE-2025-23208	2025-01-17T23:15:13.107	2025-03-04T16:50:48.533	zot is a production-ready vendor-neutral OCI image registry. The group data stored for users in the boltdb database (meta.db) is an append-list so group revocations/removals are ignored in the API. SetUserGroups is alled on login, but instead of replacing the group memberships, they are appended. This may be due to some conflict with the group definitions in the config file, but that wasn't obvious to me if it were the case. Any Zot configuration that relies on group-based authorization will not respect group remove/revocation by an IdP. This issue has been addressed in version 2.1.2. All users are advised to upgrade.

CVE-2025-21632	2025-01-19T11:15:08.650	2025-09-24T16:36:25.250	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/fpu: Ensure shadow stack is active before ""getting"" registers

The x86 shadow stack support has its own set of registers. Those registers
are XSAVE-managed, but they are ""supervisor state components"" which means
that userspace can not touch them with XSAVE/XRSTOR.  It also means that
they are not accessible from the existing ptrace ABI for XSAVE state.
Thus, there is a new ptrace get/set interface for it.

The regset code that ptrace uses provides an ->active() handler in
addition to the get/set ones. For shadow stack this ->active() handler
verifies that shadow stack is enabled via the ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK bit in the
thread struct. The ->active() handler is checked from some call sites of
the regset get/set handlers, but not the ptrace ones. This was not
understood when shadow stack support was put in place.

As a result, both the set/get handlers can be called with
XFEATURE_CET_USER in its init state, which would cause get_xsave_addr() to
return NULL and trigger a WARN_ON(). The ssp_set() handler luckily has an
ssp_active() check to avoid surprising the kernel with shadow stack
behavior when the kernel is not ready for it (ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK==0). That
check just happened to avoid the warning.

But the ->get() side wasn't so lucky. It can be called with shadow stacks
disabled, triggering the warning in practice, as reported by Christina
Schimpe:

Ensure that shadow stacks are active in a thread before looking them up
in the XSAVE buffer. Since ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK and user_ssp[SHSTK_EN] are
set at the same time, the active check ensures that there will be
something to find in the XSAVE buffer.

This warning is caused by 'kernfs_break_active_protection' when it is
writing to cpuset.cpus, and the cgroup is removed concurrently.

The commit 3a5a6d0c2b03 (""cpuset: don't nest cgroup_mutex inside
get_online_cpus()"") made cpuset_hotplug_workfn asynchronous, This change
involves calling flush_work(), which can create a multiple processes
circular locking dependency that involve cgroup_mutex, potentially leading
to a deadlock. To avoid deadlock. the commit 76bb5ab8f6e3 (""cpuset: break
kernfs active protection in cpuset_write_resmask()"") added
'kernfs_break_active_protection' in the cpuset_write_resmask. This could
lead to this warning.

After the commit 2125c0034c5d (""cgroup/cpuset: Make cpuset hotplug
processing synchronous""), the cpuset_write_resmask no longer needs to
wait the hotplug to finish, which means that concurrent hotplug and cpuset
operations are no longer possible. Therefore, the deadlock doesn't exist
anymore and it does not have to 'break active protection' now. To fix this
warning, just remove kernfs_break_active_protection operation in the
'cpuset_write_resmask'."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Using the 'net' structure via 'current' is not recommended for different

First, if the goal is to use it to read or write per-netns data, this is
inconsistent with how the ""generic"" sysctl entries are doing: directly
by only using pointers set to the table entry, e.g. table->data. Linked
to that, the per-netns data should always be obtained from the table
linked to the netns it had been created for, which may not coincide with
the reader's or writer's netns.

Another reason is that access to current->nsproxy->netns can oops if
attempted when current->nsproxy had been dropped when the current task
is exiting. This is what syzbot found, when using acct(2):

netfs: Fix kernel async DIO

Netfslib needs to be able to handle kernel-initiated asynchronous DIO that
is supplied with a bio_vec[] array.  Currently, because of the async flag,
this gets passed to netfs_extract_user_iter() which throws a warning and
fails because it only handles IOVEC and UBUF iterators.  This can be

Fix this by limiting the maximum acceptable cellname length to 253.  This

sched: sch_cake: add bounds checks to host bulk flow fairness counts

Even though we fixed a logic error in the commit cited below, syzbot
still managed to trigger an underflow of the per-host bulk flow
counters, leading to an out of bounds memory access.

To avoid any such logic errors causing out of bounds memory accesses,
this commit factors out all accesses to the per-host bulk flow counters
to a series of helpers that perform bounds-checking before any
increments and decrements. This also has the benefit of improving
readability by moving the conditional checks for the flow mode into
these helpers, instead of having them spread out throughout the
code (which was the cause of the original logic error).

As part of this change, the flow quantum calculation is consolidated
into a helper function, which means that the dithering applied to the
ost load scaling is now applied both in the DRR rotation and when a
sparse flow's quantum is first initiated. The only user-visible effect
of this is that the maximum packet size that can be sent while a flow
stays sparse will now vary with +/- one byte in some cases. This should
not make a noticeable difference in practice, and thus it's not worth
complicating the code to preserve the old behaviour."	7.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H

ipvlan: Fix use-after-free in ipvlan_get_iflink().

syzbot presented an use-after-free report [0] regarding ipvlan and
linkwatch.

ipvlan does not hold a refcnt of the lower device unlike vlan and
macvlan.

If the linkwatch work is triggered for the ipvlan dev, the lower dev
might have already been freed, resulting in UAF of ipvlan->phy_dev in
ipvlan_get_iflink().

We can delay the lower dev unregistration like vlan and macvlan by
holding the lower dev's refcnt in dev->netdev_ops->ndo_init() and
releasing it in dev->priv_destructor().

Jakub pointed out calling .ndo_XXX after unregister_netdevice() has
returned is error prone and suggested [1] addressing this UAF in the
core by taking commit 750e51603395 (""net: avoid potential UAF in
default_operstate()"") further.

Let's assume unregistering devices DOWN and use RCU protection in
default_operstate() not to race with the device unregistration.

ovl: support encoding fid from inode with no alias

Dmitry Safonov reported that a WARN_ON() assertion can be trigered by
userspace when calling inotify_show_fdinfo() for an overlayfs watched
inode, whose dentry aliases were discarded with drop_caches.

The WARN_ON() assertion in inotify_show_fdinfo() was removed, because
it is possible for encoding file handle to fail for other reason, but
the impact of failing to encode an overlayfs file handle goes beyond
this assertion.

As shown in the LTP test case mentioned in the link below, failure to
encode an overlayfs file handle from a non-aliased inode also leads to
failure to report an fid with FAN_DELETE_SELF fanotify events.

As Dmitry notes in his analyzis of the problem, ovl_encode_fh() fails
if it cannot find an alias for the inode, but this failure can be fixed.
ovl_encode_fh() seldom uses the alias and in the case of non-decodable
file handles, as is often the case with fanotify fid info,
ovl_encode_fh() never needs to use the alias to encode a file handle.

Defer finding an alias until it is actually needed so ovl_encode_fh()
will not fail in the common case of FAN_DELETE_SELF fanotify events."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

usb: gadget: f_fs: Remove WARN_ON in functionfs_bind

This commit addresses an issue related to below kernel panic where
panic_on_warn is enabled. It is caused by the unnecessary use of WARN_ON
in functionsfs_bind, which easily leads to the following scenarios.

1.adb_write in adbd               2. UDC write via configfs

The adb_open, adb_read, and adb_write operations are invoked from the
daemon, but trying to bind the function is a process that is invoked by
UDC write through configfs, which opens up the possibility of a race
condition between the two paths. In this race scenario, the kernel panic
occurs due to the WARN_ON from functionfs_bind when panic_on_warn is
enabled. This commit fixes the kernel panic by removing the unnecessary
WARN_ON.

This may happen on shared irq case. Such as two Type-C ports share one
irq. After the first port finished tcpci_register_port(), it may trigger
interrupt. However, if the interrupt comes by chance the 2nd port finishes
devm_request_threaded_irq(), the 2nd port interrupt handler will run at
first. Then the above issue happens due to tcpci is still a NULL pointer
in tcpci_irq() when dereference to regmap.

  devm_request_threaded_irq()
				<-- port1 irq comes
  disable_irq(client->irq);
  tcpci_register_port()

This will restore the logic to the state before commit (77e85107a771 ""usb:
typec: tcpci: support edge irq"").

However, moving tcpci_register_port() earlier creates a problem when use
edge irq because tcpci_init() will be called before
devm_request_threaded_irq(). The tcpci_init() writes the ALERT_MASK to
the hardware to tell it to start generating interrupts but we're not ready
to deal with them yet, then the ALERT events may be missed and ALERT line
will not recover to high level forever. To avoid the issue, this will also
set ALERT_MASK register after devm_request_threaded_irq() return."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

 (1) First, calculate the length of the resulting formatted string.

 (2) Allocate a buffer based on the returned length.

 (3) Then, perform the actual string formatting.

 (4) Check whether the lengths of the formatted strings returned in
     steps (1) and (2) are consistent.

If the core_cpumask is modified between steps (1) and (3), the lengths
obtained in these two steps may not match. Indeed our test includes cpu
hotplugging, which should modify core_cpumask while printing.

calling cpumap_print_{list, cpumask}_to_buf(), to keep it unchanged

CVE-2024-57919	2025-01-19T12:15:26.053	2025-10-01T20:18:04.717	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: fix divide error in DM plane scale calcs

dm_get_plane_scale doesn't take into account plane scaled size equal to
zero, leading to a kernel oops due to division by zero. Fix by setting
out-scale size as zero when the dst size is zero, similar to what is
done by drm_calc_scale(). This issue started with the introduction of
cursor ovelay mode that uses this function to assess cursor mode changes
via dm_crtc_get_cursor_mode() before checking plane state.

fs: relax assertions on failure to encode file handles

Encoding file handles is usually performed by a filesystem >encode_fh()
method that may fail for various reasons.

The legacy users of exportfs_encode_fh(), namely, nfsd and
name_to_handle_at(2) syscall are ready to cope with the possibility
of failure to encode a file handle.

There are a few other users of exportfs_encode_{fh,fid}() that
currently have a WARN_ON() assertion when ->encode_fh() fails.
Relax those assertions because they are wrong.

The second linked bug report states commit 16aac5ad1fa9 (""ovl: support
encoding non-decodable file handles"") in v6.6 as the regressing commit,
but this is not accurate.

The aforementioned commit only increases the chances of the assertion
and allows triggering the assertion with the reproducer using overlayfs,
inotify and drop_caches.

Triggering this assertion was always possible with other filesystems and
other reasons of ->encode_fh() failures and more particularly, it was
also possible with the exact same reproducer using overlayfs that is
mounted with options index=on,nfs_export=on also on kernels < v6.6.
Therefore, I am not listing the aforementioned commit as a Fixes commit.

v6.6.y, and other trivial conflicts applying to stable kernels < v6.6."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

In the smb2_send_interim_resp(), if ksmbd_alloc_work_struct()

in_work->response_buf when allocate_interim_rsp_buf() attempts

nfs: Fix oops in nfs_netfs_init_request() when copying to cache

When netfslib wants to copy some data that has just been read on behalf of
nfs, it creates a new write request and calls nfs_netfs_init_request() to
initialise it, but with a NULL file pointer.  This causes
nfs_file_open_context() to oops - however, we don't actually need the nfs
context as we're only going to write to the cache.

Fix this by just returning if we aren't given a file pointer and emit a
warning if the request was for something other than copy-to-cache.

Further, fix nfs_netfs_free_request() so that it doesn't try to free the
context if the pointer is NULL."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

If netfs_read_to_pagecache() gets an error from either ->prepare_read() or

only does this for two of the cases, but there are two more that aren't

CVE-2024-57929	2025-01-19T12:15:27.013	2025-09-26T19:09:58.753	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm array: fix releasing a faulty array block twice in dm_array_cursor_end

When dm_bm_read_lock() fails due to locking or checksum errors, it
releases the faulty block implicitly while leaving an invalid output
pointer behind. The caller of dm_bm_read_lock() should not operate on
this invalid dm_block pointer, or it will lead to undefined result.
For example, the dm_array_cursor incorrectly caches the invalid pointer
on reading a faulty array block, causing a double release in
dm_array_cursor_end(), then hitting the BUG_ON in dm-bufio cache_put().

Reproduce steps:

1. initialize a cache device

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc $262144""
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/cmeta bs=4k count=1
dmsetup create cache --table ""0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \
/dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0""

2. wipe the second array block offline

dmsteup remove cache cmeta cdata corig
mapping_root=$(dd if=/dev/sdc bs=1c count=8 skip=192 \
2>/dev/null | hexdump -e '1/8 ""%u\n""')
ablock=$(dd if=/dev/sdc bs=1c count=8 skip=$((4096*mapping_root+2056)) \
2>/dev/null | hexdump -e '1/8 ""%u\n""')
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdc bs=4k count=1 seek=$ablock

3. try reopen the cache device

dmsetup create cmeta --table ""0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0""
dmsetup create cdata --table ""0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192""
dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc $262144""
dmsetup create cache --table ""0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \

tracing: Have process_string() also allow arrays

In order to catch a common bug where a TRACE_EVENT() TP_fast_assign()
assigns an address of an allocated string to the ring buffer and then
references it in TP_printk(), which can be executed hours later when the
string is free, the function test_event_printk() runs on all events as
they are registered to make sure there's no unwanted dereferencing.

It calls process_string() to handle cases in TP_printk() format that has
""%s"". It returns whether or not the string is safe. But it can have some
false positives.

For instance, xe_bo_move() has:

 TP_printk(""move_lacks_source:%s, migrate object %p [size %zu] from %s to %s device_id:%s"",
            __entry->move_lacks_source ? ""yes"" : ""no"", __entry->bo, __entry->size,

            xe_mem_type_to_name[__entry->new_placement], __get_str(device_id))

Where the ""%s"" references into xe_mem_type_to_name[]. This is an array of
pointers that should be safe for the event to access. Instead of flagging
this as a bad reference, if a reference points to an array, where the
record field is the index, consider it safe."

netfs: Fix the (non-)cancellation of copy when cache is temporarily disabled

When the caching for a cookie is temporarily disabled (e.g. due to a DIO
write on that file), future copying to the cache for that file is disabled
until all fds open on that file are closed.  However, if netfslib is using
the deprecated PG_private_2 method (such as is currently used by ceph), and
decides it wants to copy to the cache, netfs_advance_write() will just bail
at the first check seeing that the cache stream is unavailable, and
indicate that it dealt with all the content.

This means that we have no subrequests to provide notifications to drive
the state machine or even to pin the request and the request just gets
discarded, leaving the folios with PG_private_2 set.

Fix this by jumping directly to cancel the request if the cache is not
available.  That way, we don't remove mark3 from the folio_queue list and
netfs_pgpriv2_cancel() will clean up the folios.

This was found by running the generic/013 xfstest against ceph with an
active cache and the ""-o fsc"" option passed to ceph.  That would usually
hang"

Fix this by not clearing the folio_queue entry if we're going to do the

riscv: mm: Fix the out of bound issue of vmemmap address

In sparse vmemmap model, the virtual address of vmemmap is calculated as:
((struct page *)VMEMMAP_START - (phys_ram_base >> PAGE_SHIFT)).
And the struct page's va can be calculated with an offset:
(vmemmap + (pfn)).

However, when initializing struct pages, kernel actually starts from the
first page from the same section that phys_ram_base belongs to. If the
first page's physical address is not (phys_ram_base >> PAGE_SHIFT), then
we get an va below VMEMMAP_START when calculating va for it's struct page.

For example, if phys_ram_base starts from 0x82000000 with pfn 0x82000, the
first page in the same section is actually pfn 0x80000. During
init_unavailable_range(), we will initialize struct page for pfn 0x80000
with virtual address ((struct page *)VMEMMAP_START - 0x2000), which is
below VMEMMAP_START as well as PCI_IO_END.

Commit 4ce6e2db00de (""virtio-blk: Ensure no requests in virtqueues before

PM callbacks. And the motivation is to drain inflight IOs before suspending.

block layer's queue freeze looks very handy, but it is also easy to cause
deadlock, such as, any attempt to call into bio_queue_enter() may run into
deadlock if the queue is frozen in current context. There are all kinds
of ->suspend() called in suspend context, so keeping queue frozen in the
whole suspend context isn't one good idea. And Marek reported lockdep
warning[1] caused by virtio-blk's freeze queue in virtblk_freeze().

[CAUSE]
The reproducer is using a corrupted image where extent tree root is
corrupted, thus forcing to use ""rescue=all,ro"" mount option to mount the
image.

Then it triggered a scrub, but since scrub relies on extent tree to find
where the data/metadata extents are, scrub_find_fill_first_stripe()
relies on an non-empty extent root.

But unfortunately scrub_find_fill_first_stripe() doesn't really expect
an NULL pointer for extent root, it use extent_root to grab fs_info and
triggered a NULL pointer dereference.

[FIX]
Add an extra check for a valid extent root at the beginning of
scrub_find_fill_first_stripe().

The new error path is introduced by 42437a6386ff (""btrfs: introduce
mount option rescue=ignorebadroots""), but that's pretty old, and later
commit b979547513ff (""btrfs: scrub: introduce helper to find and fill
sector info for a scrub_stripe"") changed how we do scrub.

CVE-2025-21664	2025-01-21T13:15:10.053	2025-09-26T16:18:27.050	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm thin: make get_first_thin use rcu-safe list first function

The documentation in rculist.h explains the absence of list_empty_rcu()
and cautions programmers against relying on a list_empty() ->
list_first() sequence in RCU safe code.  This is because each of these
functions performs its own READ_ONCE() of the list head.  This can lead
to a situation where the list_empty() sees a valid list entry, but the
subsequent list_first() sees a different view of list head state after a
modification.

In the case of dm-thin, this author had a production box crash from a GP
fault in the process_deferred_bios path.  This function saw a valid list
head in get_first_thin() but when it subsequently dereferenced that and
turned it into a thin_c, it got the inside of the struct pool, since the
list was now empty and referring to itself.  The kernel on which this
occurred printed both a warning about a refcount_t being saturated, and
a UBSAN error for an out-of-bounds cpuid access in the queued spinlock,
prior to the fault itself.  When the resulting kdump was examined, it
was possible to see another thread patiently waiting in thin_dtr's
synchronize_rcu.

The thin_dtr call managed to pull the thin_c out of the active thins
list (and have it be the last entry in the active_thins list) at just
the wrong moment which lead to this crash.

Fortunately, the fix here is straight forward.  Switch get_first_thin()
function to use list_first_or_null_rcu() which performs just a single
READ_ONCE() and returns NULL if the list is already empty.

This was run against the devicemapper test suite's thin-provisioning
suites for delete and suspend and no regressions were observed."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2025-24018	2025-01-21T17:15:16.917	2025-05-09T14:02:53.547	YesWiki is a wiki system written in PHP. In versions up to and including 4.4.5, it is possible for an authenticated user with rights to edit/create a page or comment to trigger a stored XSS which will be reflected on any page where the resource is loaded. The vulnerability makes use of the content edition feature and more specifically of the `{{attach}}` component allowing users to attach files/medias to a page. When a file is attached using the `{{attach}}` component, if the resource contained in the `file` attribute doesn't exist, then the server will generate a file upload button containing the filename. This vulnerability allows any malicious authenticated user that has the right to create a comment or edit a page to be able to steal accounts and therefore modify pages, comments, permissions, extract user data (emails), thus impacting the integrity, availability and confidentiality of a YesWiki instance. Version 4.5.0 contains a patch for the issue.	7.6	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L

CVE-2025-22150	2025-01-21T18:15:14.887	2025-01-21T18:15:14.887	Undici is an HTTP/1.1 client. Starting in version 4.5.0 and prior to versions 5.28.5, 6.21.1, and 7.2.3, undici uses `Math.random()` to choose the boundary for a multipart/form-data request. It is known that the output of `Math.random()` can be predicted if several of its generated values are known. If there is a mechanism in an app that sends multipart requests to an attacker-controlled website, they can use this to leak the necessary values. Therefore, an attacker can tamper with the requests going to the backend APIs if certain conditions are met. This is fixed in versions 5.28.5, 6.21.1, and 7.2.3. As a workaround, do not issue multipart requests to attacker controlled servers.	6.8	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

CVE-2025-24019	2025-01-21T18:15:17.933	2025-05-09T14:04:35.717	YesWiki is a wiki system written in PHP. In versions up to and including 4.4.5, it is possible for any authenticated user, through the use of the filemanager to delete any file owned by the user running the FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) on the host without any limitation on the filesystem's scope. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user to arbitrarily remove content from the Wiki resulting in partial loss of data and defacement/deterioration of the website. In the context of a container installation of YesWiki without any modification, the `yeswiki` files (for example .php) are not owned by the same user (root) as the one running the FPM process (www-data). However in a standard installation, www-data may also be the owner of the PHP files, allowing a malicious user to completely cut the access to the wiki by deleting all important PHP files (like index.php or core files of YesWiki). Version 4.5.0 contains a patch for this issue.	7.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H

An Open Redirect vulnerability was identified in the `control.php` endpoint of versions up to and including 3.2.10 of the WeGIA application. The vulnerability allows the `nextPage` parameter to be manipulated, redirecting authenticated users to arbitrary external URLs without validation. The issue stems from the lack of validation for the `nextPage` parameter, which accepts external URLs as redirection destinations. This vulnerability can be exploited to perform phishing attacks or redirect users to malicious websites.

A denial of service vulnerability affects versions 1.14.0 through 1.14.7, 1.15.0 through 1.15.11, and 1.16.0 through 1.16.4. In a Kubernetes cluster where Cilium is configured to proxy DNS traffic, an attacker can crash Cilium agents by sending a crafted DNS response to workloads from outside the cluster. For traffic that is allowed but without using DNS-based policy, the dataplane will continue to pass traffic as configured at the time of the DoS. For workloads that have DNS-based policy configured, existing connections may continue to operate, and new connections made without relying on DNS resolution may continue to be established, but new connections which rely on DNS resolution may be disrupted. Any configuration changes that affect the impacted agent may not be applied until the agent is able to restart. This issue is fixed in Cilium v1.14.18, v1.15.12, and v1.16.5.

An insecure default `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header value could lead to sensitive data exposure for users of Cilium versions 1.14.0 through 1.14.7, 1.15.0 through 1.15.11, and 1.16.0 through 1.16.4 who deploy Hubble UI using either Cilium CLI or via the Cilium Helm chart. A user with access to a Hubble UI instance affected by this issue could leak configuration details about the Kubernetes cluster which Hubble UI is monitoring, including node names, IP addresses, and other metadata about workloads and the cluster networking configuration. In order for this vulnerability to be exploited, a victim would have to first visit a malicious page. This issue is fixed in Cilium v1.14.18, v1.15.12, and v1.16.5. As a workaround, users who deploy Hubble UI using the Cilium Helm chart directly can remove the CORS headers from the Helm template as shown in the patch from commit a3489f190ba6e87b5336ee685fb6c80b1270d06d.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

netfilter: nf_set_pipapo: fix initial map fill

The initial buffer has to be inited to all-ones, but it must restrict
it to the size of the first field, not the total field size.

After each round in the map search step, the result and the fill map
are swapped, so if we have a set where f->bsize of the first element
is smaller than m->bsize_max, those one-bits are leaked into future
rounds result map.

This makes pipapo find an incorrect matching results for sets where
first field size is not the largest.

Followup patch adds a test case to nft_concat_range.sh selftest script.

Thanks to Stefano Brivio for pointing out that we need to zero out
the remainder explicitly, only correcting memset() argument isn't enough."

CVE-2025-24034	2025-01-23T18:15:33.793	2025-01-23T18:15:33.793	Himmelblau is an interoperability suite for Microsoft Azure Entra ID and Intune. Starting in version 0.7.0 and prior to versions 0.7.15 and 0.8.3, Himmelblau is vulnerable to leaking credentials in debug logs. When debug logging is enabled, user access tokens are inadvertently logged, potentially exposing sensitive authentication data. Similarly, Kerberos Ticket-Granting Tickets (TGTs) are logged when debug logging is enabled. Both issues pose a risk of exposing sensitive credentials, particularly in environments where debug logging is enabled. Himmelblau versions 0.7.15 and 0.8.3 contain a patch that fixes both issues. Some workarounds are available for users who are unable to upgrade. For the **logon compliance script issue**, disable the `logon_script` option in `/etc/himmelblau/himmelblau.conf`, and avoid using the `-d` flag when starting the `himmelblaud` daemon. For the Kerberos CCache issue, one may disable debug logging globally by setting the `debug` option in `/etc/himmelblau/himmelblau.conf` to `false` and avoiding the `-d` parameter when starting `himmelblaud`.	3.2	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N

This CVE was originally reserved in 2021 and later publicly disclosed by Replicated on their website on 21 October 2021. However, it mistakenly remained in the Reserved But Public (RBP) status with the CVE Numbering Authority (CNA). Please note that this product reached its end of life on 31 December 2024. Publishing this CVE with the CNA was required to comply with CNA rules, despite the fact that the issue was disclosed and fixed four years ago, and the affected product is no longer supported as of 2024.

Summary of VulnerabilityThis advisory discloses a low severity security vulnerability in the versions of Replicated Classic listed above (“Affected Replicated Classic Versions”)

DescriptionReplicated Classic versions prior to 2.53.1 have an authenticated API from the Replicated Admin Console that may expose sensitive data including application secrets, depending on how the application manifests are written. A user with valid credentials and access to the Admin Console port (8800) on the Replicated Classic server can retrieve container definitions including environment variables which may contain passwords and other secrets depending on how the application is configured.

This data is shared over authenticated sessions to the Admin Console only, and was never displayed or used in the application processing. To remediate this issue, we removed the sensitive data from the API, sending only the data to the Admin Console that was needed.

TimelineThis issue was discovered during a security review on 16 September 2021.
Patched versions were released on 23 September 2021.
This advisory was published on 21 October 2021.

Starting in version 4.0.0-beta.18 and prior to 4.0.0-beta.253, a vulnerability in the execution of commands on remote servers allows an authenticated user to execute arbitrary code on the local Coolify container, gaining access to data and private keys or tokens of other users/teams. The ability to inject malicious commands into the Coolify container gives authenticated attackers the ability to fully retrieve and control the data and availability of the software. Centrally hosted Coolify instances (open registration and/or multiple teams with potentially untrustworthy users) are especially at risk, as sensitive data of all users and connected servers can be leaked by any user. Additionally, attackers are able to modify the running software, potentially deploying malicious images to remote nodes or generally changing its behavior.

Specifically, dde-api-proxy runs as root and forwards messages from arbitrary local users to legacy D-Bus methods in the actual D-Bus services, and the actual D-Bus services don't know about the proxy situation (they believe that root is asking them to do things). Consequently several proxied methods, that shouldn't be accessible to non-root users, are accessible to non-root users. In situations where Polkit is involved, the caller would be treated as admin, resulting in a similar escalation of privileges.	8.4	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2025-24359	2025-01-24T17:15:16.197	2025-01-24T17:15:16.197	ASTEVAL is an evaluator of Python expressions and statements. Prior to version 1.0.6, if an attacker can control the input to the `asteval` library, they can bypass asteval's restrictions and execute arbitrary Python code in the context of the application using the library. The vulnerability is rooted in how `asteval` performs handling of `FormattedValue` AST nodes. In particular, the `on_formattedvalue` value uses the dangerous format method of the str class. The code allows an attacker to manipulate the value of the string used in the dangerous call `fmt.format(__fstring__=val)`. This vulnerability can be exploited to access protected attributes by intentionally triggering an `AttributeError` exception. The attacker can then catch the exception and use its `obj` attribute to gain arbitrary access to sensitive or protected object properties.

CVE-2025-24362	2025-01-24T18:15:32.383	2025-03-31T14:15:18.993	"In some circumstances, debug artifacts uploaded by the CodeQL Action after a failed code scanning workflow run may contain the environment variables from the workflow run, including any secrets that were exposed as environment variables to the workflow. Users with read access to the repository would be able to access this artifact, containing any secrets from the environment. This vulnerability is patched in CodeQL Action version 3.28.3 or later, or CodeQL CLI version 2.20.3 or later.

For some affected workflow runs, the exposed environment variables in the debug artifacts included a valid `GITHUB_TOKEN` for the workflow run, which has access to the repository in which the workflow ran, and all the permissions specified in the workflow or job. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is valid until the job completes or 24 hours has elapsed, whichever comes first.

Environment variables are exposed only from workflow runs that satisfy all of the following conditions:
- Code scanning workflow configured to scan the Java/Kotlin languages.
- Running in a repository containing Kotlin source code.
- Running with debug artifacts enabled.
- Using CodeQL Action versions <= 3.28.2, and CodeQL CLI versions >= 2.9.2 (May 2022) and <= 2.20.2.
- The workflow run fails before the CodeQL database is finalized within the `github/codeql-action/analyze` step.
- Running in any GitHub environment: GitHub.com, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server. Note: artifacts are only accessible to users within the same GitHub environment with access to the scanned repo.

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` exposed in this way would only have been valid for workflow runs that satisfy all of the following conditions, in addition to the conditions above:
- Using CodeQL Action versions >= 3.26.11 (October 2024) and <= 3.28.2, or >= 2.26.11 and < 3.
- Running in GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise Cloud only (not valid on GitHub Enterprise Server).

In rare cases during advanced setup, logging of environment variables may also occur during database creation of Java, Swift, and C/C++. Please read the corresponding CodeQL CLI advisory GHSA-gqh3-9prg-j95m for more details.

In CodeQL CLI versions >= 2.9.2 and <= 2.20.2, the CodeQL Kotlin extractor logs all environment variables by default into an intermediate file during the process of creating a CodeQL database for Kotlin code. This is a part of the CodeQL CLI and is invoked by the CodeQL Action for analyzing Kotlin repositories. 

On Actions, the environment variables logged include GITHUB_TOKEN, which grants permissions to the repository being scanned.
The intermediate file containing environment variables is deleted when finalizing the database, so it is not included in a successfully created database. It is, however, included in the debug artifact that is uploaded on a failed analysis run if the CodeQL Action was invoked in debug mode.

Therefore, under these specific circumstances (incomplete database creation using the CodeQL Action in debug mode) an attacker with access to the debug artifact would gain unauthorized access to repository secrets from the environment, including both the `GITHUB_TOKEN` and any user-configured secrets made available via environment variables.

The impact of the `GITHUB_TOKEN` leaked in this environment is limited:
- For workflows on GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise Cloud using CodeQL Action versions >= 3.26.11 and <= 3.28.2, or >= 2.26.11 and < 3, which in turn use the `actions/artifacts v4` library, the debug artifact is uploaded before the workflow job completes. During this time the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is still valid, providing an opportunity for attackers to gain access to the repository.
- For all other workflows, the debug artifact is uploaded after the workflow job completes, at which point the leaked `GITHUB_TOKEN` has been revoked and cannot be used to access the repository."

CVE-2025-24363	2025-01-24T19:15:13.633	2025-01-24T19:15:13.633	The HL7 FHIR IG publisher is a tool to take a set of inputs and create a standard FHIR IG. Prior to version 1.8.9, in CI contexts, the IG Publisher CLI uses git commands to determine the URL of the originating repo. If the repo was cloned, or otherwise set to use a repo that uses a username and credential based URL, the entire URL will be included in the built Implementation Guide, exposing username and credential. This does not impact users that clone public repos without credentials, such as those using the auto-ig-build continuous integration infrastructure. This problem has been patched in release 1.8.9. Some workarounds are available. Users should ensure the IG repo they are publishing does not have username or credentials included in the `origin` URL. Running the command `git remote origin url` should return a URL that contains no username, password, or token; or users should run the IG Publisher CLI with the `-repo` parameter and specify a URL that contains no username, password, or token.	4.2	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVE-2024-46881	2025-01-26T07:15:08.947	2025-01-26T07:15:08.947	Develocity (formerly Gradle Enterprise) before 2024.1.8 has Incorrect Access Control. Project-level access control configuration was introduced in Enterprise Config schema version 8. Migration functionality from schema version 8 to versions 9 and 10 (in affected vulnerable versions) does not include the projects section of the configuration. This leads to all of the project settings being reset to their defaults when the old schema is loaded. In the case of projects.enabled, the default is false. Thus, using an enterprise config v8 results in Project level access control being disabled, even if it was previously enabled, and previously restricted project information disclosed. Most commonly, this occurs when a Develocity instance is upgraded from an earlier version. Specifically, this occurs if: Develocity 2023.3.X is upgraded to 2023.4.X; Develocity 2023.3.X is upgraded to 2024.1.X up to and including 2024.1.7; or Develocity 2023.4.X is upgraded to 2024.1.X up to and including 2024.1.7. The flaw does not occur when upgrading to a fixed version. An upgrade can only be triggered via administrator access, and cannot be forced by an external attacker.	7.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N

This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'save' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change plugin access privileges via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Successful exploitation allows attackers with subscriber-level privileges and above to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Solr instances running on Windows are vulnerable to arbitrary filepath write-access, due to a lack of input-sanitation in the ""configset upload"" API.  Commonly known as a ""zipslip"", maliciously constructed ZIP files can use relative filepaths to write data to unanticipated parts of the filesystem.  
This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.6 through 9.7.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.8.0, which fixes the issue.  Users unable to upgrade may also safely prevent the issue by using Solr's ""Rule-Based Authentication Plugin"" to restrict access to the configset upload API, so that it can only be accessed by a trusted set of administrators/users."	5.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

Solr instances that (1) use the ""FileSystemConfigSetService"" component (the default in ""standalone"" or ""user-managed"" mode), and (2) are running without authentication and authorization are vulnerable to a sort of privilege escalation wherein individual ""trusted"" configset files can be ignored in favor of potentially-untrusted replacements available elsewhere on the filesystem.  These replacement config files are treated as ""trusted"" and can use ""<lib>"" tags to add to Solr's classpath, which an attacker might use to load malicious code as a searchComponent or other plugin.

This issue affects all Apache Solr versions up through Solr 9.7.  Users can protect against the vulnerability by enabling authentication and authorization on their Solr clusters or switching to SolrCloud (and away from ""FileSystemConfigSetService"").  Users are also recommended to upgrade to Solr 9.8.0, which mitigates this issue by disabling use of ""<lib>"" tags by default."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

This issue affects Apache Cocoon: all versions.

When a continuation is created, it gets a random identifier. Because the random number generator used to generate these identifiers was seeded with the startup time, it may not have been sufficiently unpredictable, and an attacker could use this to guess continuation ids and look up continuations they should not have had access to.

As a mitigation, you may enable the ""session-bound-continuations"" option to make sure continuations are not shared across sessions.


As this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.

When receiving a data packet from an unknown IP address/port combination, fastd will assume that one of its connected peers has moved to a new address and initiate a reconnect by sending a handshake packet. This ""fast reconnect"" avoids having to wait for a session timeout (up to ~90s) until a new connection is established. Even a 1-byte UDP packet just containing the fastd packet type header can trigger a much larger handshake packet (~150 bytes of UDP payload). Including IPv4 and UDP headers, the resulting amplification factor is roughly 12-13. By sending data packets with a spoofed source address to fastd instances reachable on the internet, this amplification of UDP traffic might be used to facilitate a Distributed Denial of Service attack.

CVE-2024-23953	2025-01-28T09:15:09.187	2025-07-15T16:28:16.837	"Use of Arrays.equals() in LlapSignerImpl in Apache Hive to compare message signatures allows attacker to forge a valid signature for an arbitrary message byte by byte. The attacker should be an authorized user of the product to perform this attack. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.0, which fixes this issue.

The problem occurs when an application doesn’t use a constant-time algorithm for validating a signature. The method Arrays.equals() returns false right away when it sees that one of the input’s bytes are different. It means that the comparison time depends on the contents of the arrays. This little thing may allow an attacker to forge a valid signature for an arbitrary message byte by byte. So it might allow malicious users to submit splits/work with selected signatures to LLAP without running as a privileged user, potentially leading to DDoS attack.

A NFS server that exports a cd9660, tarfs, or ext2fs file system can be made to panic by mounting and accessing the export with an NFS client.  Further exploitation (e.g., bypassing file permission checking or remote kernel code execution) is potentially possible, though this has not been demonstrated.  In particular, release kernels are compiled with stack protection enabled, and some instances of the overflow are caught by this mechanism, causing a panic."	6.0	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H

CVE-2025-24376	2025-01-30T16:15:31.630	2025-01-30T16:15:31.630	kubewarden-controller is a Kubernetes controller that allows you to dynamically register Kubewarden admission policies. By design, AdmissionPolicy and AdmissionPolicyGroup can evaluate only namespaced resources. The resources to be evaluated are determined by the rules provided by the user when defining the policy. There might be Kubernetes namespaced resources that should not be validated by AdmissionPolicy and by the AdmissionPolicyGroup policies because of their sensitive nature. For example, PolicyReport are namespaced resources that contain the list of non compliant objects found inside of a namespace. An attacker can use either an AdmissionPolicy or an AdmissionPolicyGroup to prevent the creation and update of PolicyReport objects to hide non-compliant resources. Moreover, the same attacker might use a mutating AdmissionPolicy to alter the contents of the PolicyReport created inside of the namespace. Starting from the 1.21.0 release, the validation rules applied to AdmissionPolicy and AdmissionPolicyGroup have been tightened to prevent them from validating sensitive types of namespaced resources.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L		
CVE-2025-24784	2025-01-30T16:15:31.780	2025-01-30T16:15:31.780	kubewarden-controller is a Kubernetes controller that allows you to dynamically register Kubewarden admission policies. The policy group feature, added to by the 1.17.0 release. By being namespaced, the AdmissionPolicyGroup has a well constrained impact on cluster resources. Hence, it’s considered safe to allow non-admin users to create and manage these resources in the namespaces they own. Kubewarden policies can be allowed to query the Kubernetes API at evaluation time; these types of policies are called “context aware“. Context aware policies can perform list and get operations against a Kubernetes cluster. The queries are done using the ServiceAccount of the Policy Server instance that hosts the policy. That means that access to the cluster is determined by the RBAC rules that apply to that ServiceAccount. The AdmissionPolicyGroup CRD allowed the deployment of context aware policies. This could allow an attacker to obtain information about resources that are out of their reach, by leveraging a higher access to the cluster granted to the ServiceAccount token used to run the policy. The impact of this vulnerability depends on the privileges that have been granted to the ServiceAccount used to run the Policy Server and assumes that users are using the recommended best practices of keeping the Policy Server's ServiceAccount least privileged. By default, the Kubewarden helm chart grants access to the following resources (cluster wide) only: Namespace, Pod, Deployment and Ingress.

CVE-2025-24802	2025-01-30T20:15:51.010	2025-01-30T20:15:51.010	Plonky2 is a SNARK implementation based on techniques from PLONK and FRI. Lookup tables, whose length is not divisible by 26 = floor(num_routed_wires / 3) always include the 0 -> 0 input-output pair. Thus a malicious prover can always prove that f(0) = 0 for any lookup table f (unless its length happens to be divisible by 26). The cause of problem is that the LookupTableGate-s are padded with zeros. A workaround from the user side is to extend the table (by repeating some entries) so that its length becomes divisible by 26. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.1.	8.6	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N

net: fec: handle page_pool_dev_alloc_pages error

The fec_enet_update_cbd function calls page_pool_dev_alloc_pages but did
not handle the case when it returned NULL. There was a WARN_ON(!new_page)
but it would still proceed to use the NULL pointer and then crash.

This case does seem somewhat rare but when the system is under memory
pressure it can happen. One case where I can duplicate this with some
frequency is when writing over a smbd share to a SATA HDD attached to an
imx6q.

Setting /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes to higher values also seems to solve
the problem for my test case. But it still seems wrong that the fec driver
ignores the memory allocation error and can crash.

This commit handles the allocation error by dropping the current packet."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

pfcp: Destroy device along with udp socket's netns dismantle.

pfcp_newlink() links the device to a list in dev_net(dev) instead
of net, where a udp tunnel socket is created.

Even when net is removed, the device stays alive on dev_net(dev).
Then, removing net triggers the splat below. [0]

In this example, pfcp0 is created in ns2, but the udp socket is
created in ns1.

  ip netns add ns1
  ip netns add ns2
  ip -n ns1 link add netns ns2 name pfcp0 type pfcp
  ip netns del ns1

Let's link the device to the socket's netns instead.

Now, pfcp_net_exit() needs another netdev iteration to remove
all pfcp devices in the netns.

pfcp_dev_list is not used under RCU, so the list API is converted
to the non-RCU variant.

pfcp_net_exit() can be converted to .exit_batch_rtnl() in net-next.

openvswitch: fix lockup on tx to unregistering netdev with carrier

Commit in a fixes tag attempted to fix the issue in the following
sequence of calls:

    do_output
    -> ovs_vport_send
       -> dev_queue_xmit
          -> __dev_queue_xmit
             -> netdev_core_pick_tx
                -> skb_tx_hash

When device is unregistering, the 'dev->real_num_tx_queues' goes to
zero and the 'while (unlikely(hash >= qcount))' loop inside the
'skb_tx_hash' becomes infinite, locking up the core forever.

But unfortunately, checking just the carrier status is not enough to
fix the issue, because some devices may still be in unregistering
state while reporting carrier status OK.

One example of such device is a net/dummy.  It sets carrier ON
on start, but it doesn't implement .ndo_stop to set the carrier off.
And it makes sense, because dummy doesn't really have a carrier.
Therefore, while this device is unregistering, it's still easy to hit
the infinite loop in the skb_tx_hash() from the OVS datapath.  There
might be other drivers that do the same, but dummy by itself is
important for the OVS ecosystem, because it is frequently used as a
packet sink for tcpdump while debugging OVS deployments.  And when the
issue is hit, the only way to recover is to reboot.

Fix that by also checking if the device is running.  The running
state is handled by the net core during unregistering, so it covers
unregistering case better, and we don't really need to send packets
to devices that are not running anyway.

While only checking the running state might be enough, the carrier
check is preserved.  The running and the carrier states seem disjoined
throughout the code and different drivers.  And other core functions
like __dev_direct_xmit() check both before attempting to transmit
a packet.  So, it seems safer to check both flags in OVS as well."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

  rx-gro-hw: on

The fact that HW-GRO doesn't get re-enabled automatically is just
a minor annoyance. The real issue is that the features will randomly
come back during another reconfiguration which just happens to invoke
netdev_update_features(). The driver doesn't handle reconfiguring
two things at a time very robustly.

Starting with commit 98ba1d931f61 (""bnxt_en: Fix RSS logic in
__bnxt_reserve_rings()"") we only reconfigure the RSS hash table
if the ""effective"" number of Rx rings has changed. If HW-GRO is
enabled ""effective"" number of rings is 2x what user sees.
So if we are in the bad state, with HW-GRO re-enablement ""pending""
after XDP off, and we lower the rings by / 2 - the HW-GRO rings
doing 2x and the ethtool -L doing / 2 may cancel each other out,
and the:

  if (old_rx_rings != bp->hw_resc.resv_rx_rings &&

condition in __bnxt_reserve_rings() will be false.
The RSS map won't get updated, and we'll crash with:

  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000168

As we try to access a freed ring.

The issue is present since XDP support was added, really, but
prior to commit 98ba1d931f61 (""bnxt_en: Fix RSS logic in
__bnxt_reserve_rings()"") it wasn't causing major issues."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2025-24891	2025-01-31T23:15:08.457	2025-01-31T23:15:08.457	Dumb Drop is a file upload application. Users with permission to upload to the service are able to exploit a path traversal vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary system files. As the container runs as root by default, there is no limit to what can be overwritten. With this, it's possible to inject malicious payloads into files ran on schedule or upon certain service actions. As the service is not required to run with authentication enabled, this may permit wholly unprivileged users root access. Otherwise, anybody with a PIN.	9.6	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
