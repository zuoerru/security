At some point the manager obviously stops being able to accept new nodes, since it runs out of memory. Given that both for Docker swarm and for Docker Swarmkit nodes are *required* to provide a secret token (it's actually the only mode of operation), this means that no adversary can simply join nodes and exhaust manager resources.

Spring Security does not consider URL path parameters when processing security constraints. By adding a URL path parameter with an encoded ""/"" to a request, an attacker may be able to bypass a security constraint. The root cause of this issue is a lack of clarity regarding the handling of path parameters in the Servlet Specification. Some Servlet containers include path parameters in the value returned for getPathInfo() and some do not. Spring Security uses the value returned by getPathInfo() as part of the process of mapping requests to security constraints. The unexpected presence of path parameters can cause a constraint to be bypassed. Users of Apache Tomcat (all current versions) are not affected by this vulnerability since Tomcat follows the guidance previously provided by the Servlet Expert group and strips path parameters from the value returned by getContextPath(), getServletPath(), and getPathInfo(). Users of other Servlet containers based on Apache Tomcat may or may not be affected depending on whether or not the handling of path parameters has been modified.

The zero-permission app will create an active install session for a separate app that it has embedded within it. The active install session of the embedded app is performed using the android.content.pm.PackageInstaller class and its nested classes in the Android API. The active install session will write the embedded APK file to the /data/app directory, but the app will not be installed since third-party applications cannot programmatically install apps. Samsung has modified AOSP in order to accelerate the parsing of APKs by introducing the com.android.server.pm.PackagePrefetcher class and its nested classes. These classes will parse the APKs present in the /data/app directory and other directories, even if the app is not actually installed. The embedded APK that was written to the /data/app directory via the active install session has a very large but valid AndroidManifest.xml file. Specifically, the AndroidManifest.xml file contains a very large string value for the name of a permission-tree that it declares. When system_server tries to parse the APK file of the embedded app from the active install session, it will crash due to an uncaught error (i.e., java.lang.OutOfMemoryError) or an uncaught exception (i.e., std::bad_alloc) because of memory constraints. The Samsung Android device will encounter a soft reboot due to a system_server crash, and this action will keep repeating since parsing the APKs in the /data/app directory as performed by the system_server process is part of the normal boot process. The Samsung ID is SVE-2016-6917.	7.1	HIGH	AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C

The MTKLogger app with a package name of com.mediatek.mtklogger has application components that are accessible to any application that resides on the device. Namely, the com.mediatek.mtklogger.framework.LogReceiver and com.mediatek.mtklogger.framework.MTKLoggerService application components are exported since they contain an intent filter, are not protected by a custom permission, and do not explicitly set the android:exported attribute to false. Therefore, these components are exported by default and are thus accessible to any third party application by using android.content.Intent object for communication. These application components can be used to start and stop the logs using Intent objects with embedded data. The available logs are the GPS log, modem log, network log, and mobile log. The base directory that contains the directories for the 4 types of logs is /sdcard/mtklog which makes them accessible to apps that require the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission. The GPS log contains the GPS coordinates of the user as well as a timestamp for the coordinates. The modem log contains AT commands and their parameters which allow the user's outgoing and incoming calls and text messages to be obtained. The network log is a tcpdump network capture. The mobile log contains the Android log, which is not available to third-party apps as of Android 4.1. The LG ID is LVE-SMP-160019.	4.3	MEDIUM	AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2016-10136	2017-01-13T09:59:00.217	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	An issue was discovered on BLU R1 HD devices with Shanghai Adups software. The content provider named com.adups.fota.sysoper.provider.InfoProvider in the app with a package name of com.adups.fota.sysoper allows any app on the device to read, write, and delete files as the system user. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file, it sets the android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute as the system user, which is a very privileged user on the device. This allows a third-party app to read, write, and delete files owned by the system user. The third-party app can modify the /data/system/users/0/settings_secure.xml file to add an app as a notification listener to be able to receive the text of notifications as they are received on the device. This also allows the /data/system/users/0/accounts.db to be read which contains authentication tokens for various accounts on the device. The third-party app can obtain privileged information and also modify files to obtain more privileges on the device.	7.2	HIGH	AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C		
CVE-2016-10137	2017-01-13T09:59:00.233	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	An issue was discovered on BLU R1 HD devices with Shanghai Adups software. The content provider named com.adups.fota.sysoper.provider.InfoProvider in the app with a package name of com.adups.fota.sysoper allows any app on the device to read, write, and delete files as the system user. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file, it sets the android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute as the system user, which is a very privileged user on the device. This allows a third-party app to read, write, and delete the user's sent and received text messages and call log. This allows a third-party app to obtain PII from the user without permission to do so.	7.2	HIGH	AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C		
CVE-2016-10138	2017-01-13T09:59:00.263	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	An issue was discovered on BLU Advance 5.0 and BLU R1 HD devices with Shanghai Adups software. The com.adups.fota.sysoper app is installed as a system app and cannot be disabled by the user. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file, it sets the android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute as the system user, which is a very privileged user on the device. The app has an exported broadcast receiver named com.adups.fota.sysoper.WriteCommandReceiver which any app on the device can interact with. Therefore, any app can send a command embedded in an intent which will be executed by the WriteCommandReceiver component which is executing as the system user. The third-party app, utilizing the WriteCommandReceiver, can perform the following actions: call a phone number, factory reset the device, take pictures of the screen, record the screen in a video, install applications, inject events, obtain the Android log, and others. In addition, the com.adups.fota.sysoper.TaskService component will make a request to a URL of http://rebootv5.adsunflower.com/ps/fetch.do where the commands in the String array with a key of sf in the JSON Object sent back by the server will be executed as the system user. Since the connection is made via HTTP, it is vulnerable to a MITM attack.	7.2	HIGH	AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C		
CVE-2016-10139	2017-01-13T09:59:00.310	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	An issue was discovered on BLU R1 HD devices with Shanghai Adups software. The two package names involved in the exfiltration are com.adups.fota and com.adups.fota.sysoper. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file, it sets the android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute as the system user, which is a very privileged user on the device. Therefore, the app executing as the system user has been granted a number of powerful permissions even though they are not present in the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file. This app provides the com.adups.fota app access to the user's call log, text messages, and various device identifiers through the com.adups.fota.sysoper.provider.InfoProvider component. The com.adups.fota app uses timestamps when it runs and is eligible to exfiltrate the user's PII every 72 hours. If 72 hours have passed since the value of the timestamp, then the exfiltration will be triggered by the user plugging in the device to charge or when they leave or enter a wireless network. The exfiltration occurs in the background without any user interaction.	7.2	HIGH	AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C

CVE-2016-10142	2017-01-14T07:59:00.137	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	An issue was discovered in the IPv6 protocol specification, related to ICMP Packet Too Big (PTB) messages. (The scope of this CVE is all affected IPv6 implementations from all vendors.) The security implications of IP fragmentation have been discussed at length in [RFC6274] and [RFC7739]. An attacker can leverage the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments to trigger the use of fragmentation in an arbitrary IPv6 flow (in scenarios in which actual fragmentation of packets is not needed) and can subsequently perform any type of fragmentation-based attack against legacy IPv6 nodes that do not implement [RFC6946]. That is, employing fragmentation where not actually needed allows for fragmentation-based attack vectors to be employed, unnecessarily. We note that, unfortunately, even nodes that already implement [RFC6946] can be subject to DoS attacks as a result of the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments. Let us assume that Host A is communicating with Host B and that, as a result of the widespread dropping of IPv6 packets that contain extension headers (including fragmentation) [RFC7872], some intermediate node filters fragments between Host B and Host A. If an attacker sends a forged ICMPv6 PTB error message to Host B, reporting an MTU smaller than 1280, this will trigger the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments from that moment on (as required by [RFC2460]). When Host B starts sending IPv6 atomic fragments (in response to the received ICMPv6 PTB error message), these packets will be dropped, since we previously noted that IPv6 packets with extension headers were being dropped between Host B and Host A. Thus, this situation will result in a DoS scenario. Another possible scenario is that in which two BGP peers are employing IPv6 transport and they implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) to drop IPv6 fragments (to avoid control-plane attacks). If the aforementioned BGP peers drop IPv6 fragments but still honor received ICMPv6 PTB error messages, an attacker could easily attack the corresponding peering session by simply sending an ICMPv6 PTB message with a reported MTU smaller than 1280 bytes. Once the attack packet has been sent, the aforementioned routers will themselves be the ones dropping their own traffic.	5.0	MEDIUM	AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P

CVE-2017-5223	2017-01-16T06:59:00.197	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	An issue was discovered in PHPMailer before 5.2.22. PHPMailer's msgHTML method applies transformations to an HTML document to make it usable as an email message body. One of the transformations is to convert relative image URLs into attachments using a script-provided base directory. If no base directory is provided, it resolves to /, meaning that relative image URLs get treated as absolute local file paths and added as attachments. To form a remote vulnerability, the msgHTML method must be called, passed an unfiltered, user-supplied HTML document, and must not set a base directory.	2.1	LOW	AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N

CVE-2017-5521	2017-01-17T09:59:00.333	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	An issue was discovered on NETGEAR R8500, R8300, R7000, R6400, R7300, R7100LG, R6300v2, WNDR3400v3, WNR3500Lv2, R6250, R6700, R6900, and R8000 devices. They are prone to password disclosure via simple crafted requests to the web management server. The bug is exploitable remotely if the remote management option is set, and can also be exploited given access to the router over LAN or WLAN. When trying to access the web panel, a user is asked to authenticate; if the authentication is canceled and password recovery is not enabled, the user is redirected to a page that exposes a password recovery token. If a user supplies the correct token to the page /passwordrecovered.cgi?id=TOKEN (and password recovery is not enabled), they will receive the admin password for the router. If password recovery is set the exploit will fail, as it will ask the user for the recovery questions that were previously set when enabling that feature. This is persistent (even after disabling the recovery option, the exploit will fail) because the router will ask for the security questions.	8.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

When Quagga daemons are configured with their telnet CLI enabled, anyone who can connect to the TCP ports can trigger this vulnerability, prior to authentication. Most distributions restrict the Quagga telnet interface to local access only by default. The Quagga telnet interface 'vty' input buffer grows automatically, without bound, so long as a newline is not entered. This allows an attacker to cause the Quagga daemon to allocate unbounded memory by sending very long strings without a newline. Eventually the daemon is terminated by the system, or the system itself runs out of memory. This is fixed in Quagga 1.1.1 and Free Range Routing (FRR) Protocol Suite 2017-01-10.	7.8	HIGH	AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C

CVE-2016-9553	2017-01-28T12:59:00.133	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	The Sophos Web Appliance (version 4.2.1.3) is vulnerable to two Remote Command Injection vulnerabilities affecting its web administrative interface. These vulnerabilities occur in the MgrReport.php (/controllers/MgrReport.php) component responsible for blocking and unblocking IP addresses from accessing the device. The device doesn't properly escape the information passed in the variables 'unblockip' and 'blockip' before calling the shell_exec() function which allows for system commands to be injected into the device. The code erroneously suggests that the information handled is protected by utilizing the variable name 'escapedips' - however this was not the case. The Sophos ID is NSWA-1258.	9.0	HIGH	AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C		
CVE-2016-9554	2017-01-28T12:59:00.180	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	The Sophos Web Appliance Remote / Secure Web Gateway server (version 4.2.1.3) is vulnerable to a Remote Command Injection vulnerability in its web administrative interface. These vulnerabilities occur in MgrDiagnosticTools.php (/controllers/MgrDiagnosticTools.php), in the component responsible for performing diagnostic tests with the UNIX wget utility. The application doesn't properly escape the information passed in the 'url' variable before calling the executeCommand class function ($this->dtObj->executeCommand). This function calls exec() with unsanitized user input allowing for remote command injection. The page that contains the vulnerabilities, /controllers/MgrDiagnosticTools.php, is accessed by a built-in command answered by the administrative interface. The command that calls to that vulnerable page (passed in the 'section' parameter) is: 'configuration'. Exploitation of this vulnerability yields shell access to the remote machine under the 'spiderman' user account.	9.0	HIGH	AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C
