CVE-2017-3826	2017-03-01T21:59:00.367	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	A vulnerability in the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) decoder of the Cisco NetFlow Generation Appliance (NGA) with software before 1.1(1a) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to hang or unexpectedly reload, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incomplete validation of SCTP packets being monitored on the NGA data ports. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed SCTP packets on a network that is monitored by an NGA data port. SCTP packets addressed to the IP address of the NGA itself will not trigger this vulnerability. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the appliance to become unresponsive or reload, causing a DoS condition. User interaction could be needed to recover the device using the reboot command from the CLI. The following Cisco NetFlow Generation Appliances are vulnerable: NGA 3140, NGA 3240, NGA 3340.

CVE-2015-8994	2017-03-02T06:59:00.167	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	"An issue was discovered in PHP 5.x and 7.x, when the configuration uses apache2handler/mod_php or php-fpm with OpCache enabled. With 5.x after 5.6.28 or 7.x after 7.0.13, the issue is resolved in a non-default configuration with the opcache.validate_permission=1 setting. The vulnerability details are as follows. In PHP SAPIs where PHP interpreters share a common parent process, Zend OpCache creates a shared memory object owned by the common parent during initialization. Child PHP processes inherit the SHM descriptor, using it to cache and retrieve compiled script bytecode (""opcode"" in PHP jargon). Cache keys vary depending on configuration, but filename is a central key component, and compiled opcode can generally be run if a script's filename is known or can be guessed. Many common shared-hosting configurations change EUID in child processes to enforce privilege separation among hosted users (for example using mod_ruid2 for the Apache HTTP Server, or php-fpm user settings). In these scenarios, the default Zend OpCache behavior defeats script file permissions by sharing a single SHM cache among all child PHP processes. PHP scripts often contain sensitive information: Think of CMS configurations where reading or running another user's script usually means gaining privileges to the CMS database."	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2017-3854	2017-03-15T20:59:00.257	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	A vulnerability in the mesh code of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to impersonate a WLC in a meshed topology. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authentication of the parent access point in a mesh configuration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by forcing the target system to disconnect from the correct parent access point and reconnect to a rogue access point owned by the attacker. An exploit could allow the attacker to control the traffic flowing through the impacted access point or take full control of the target system. This vulnerability affects the following products running a vulnerable version of Wireless LAN Controller software and configured for meshed mode: Cisco 8500 Series Wireless Controller, Cisco 5500 Series Wireless Controller, Cisco 2500 Series Wireless Controller, Cisco Flex 7500 Series Wireless Controller, Cisco Virtual Wireless Controller, Wireless Services Module 2 (WiSM2). Note that additional configuration is needed in addition to upgrading to a fixed release. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuc98992 CSCuu14804.	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2017-3881	2017-03-17T22:59:00.640	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	A vulnerability in the Cisco Cluster Management Protocol (CMP) processing code in Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device or remotely execute code with elevated privileges. The Cluster Management Protocol utilizes Telnet internally as a signaling and command protocol between cluster members. The vulnerability is due to the combination of two factors: (1) the failure to restrict the use of CMP-specific Telnet options only to internal, local communications between cluster members and instead accept and process such options over any Telnet connection to an affected device; and (2) the incorrect processing of malformed CMP-specific Telnet options. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed CMP-specific Telnet options while establishing a Telnet session with an affected Cisco device configured to accept Telnet connections. An exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the device or cause a reload of the affected device. This affects Catalyst switches, Embedded Service 2020 switches, Enhanced Layer 2 EtherSwitch Service Module, Enhanced Layer 2/3 EtherSwitch Service Module, Gigabit Ethernet Switch Module (CGESM) for HP, IE Industrial Ethernet switches, ME 4924-10GE switch, RF Gateway 10, and SM-X Layer 2/3 EtherSwitch Service Module.

CVE-2016-9462	2017-03-28T02:59:00.887	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	Nextcloud Server before 9.0.52 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.4 are not properly verifying restore privileges when restoring a file. The restore capability of Nextcloud/ownCloud was not verifying whether a user has only read-only access to a share. Thus a user with read-only access was able to restore old versions.	4.0	MEDIUM	AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N		
CVE-2016-9463	2017-03-28T02:59:00.933	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	Nextcloud Server before 9.0.54 and 10.0.1 & ownCloud Server before 9.1.2, 9.0.6, and 8.2.9 suffer from SMB User Authentication Bypass. Nextcloud/ownCloud include an optional and not by default enabled SMB authentication component that allows authenticating users against an SMB server. This backend is implemented in a way that tries to connect to a SMB server and if that succeeded consider the user logged-in. The backend did not properly take into account SMB servers that have any kind of anonymous auth configured. This is the default on SMB servers nowadays and allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to an account without valid credentials. Note: The SMB backend is disabled by default and requires manual configuration in the Nextcloud/ownCloud config file. If you have not configured the SMB backend then you're not affected by this vulnerability.	6.8	MEDIUM	AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P		
CVE-2016-9464	2017-03-28T02:59:00.997	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	Nextcloud Server before 9.0.54 and 10.0.0 suffers from an improper authorization check on removing shares. The Sharing Backend as implemented in Nextcloud does differentiate between shares to users and groups. In case of a received group share, users should be able to unshare the file to themselves but not to the whole group. The previous API implementation simply unshared the file to all users in the group.	4.0	MEDIUM	AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N

Usernames weren't properly sanitised when creating users on a Revive Adserver instance. Especially, control characters were not filtered, allowing apparently identical usernames to co-exist in the system, due to the fact that such characters are normally ignored when an HTML page is displayed in a browser.
