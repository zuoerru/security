erofs: fix lz4 inplace decompression

Currently EROFS can map another compressed buffer for inplace
decompression, that was used to handle the cases that some pages of
compressed data are actually not in-place I/O.

However, like most simple LZ77 algorithms, LZ4 expects the compressed
data is arranged at the end of the decompressed buffer and it
explicitly uses memmove() to handle overlapping:
  __________________________________________________________
 |_ direction of decompression --> ____ |_ compressed data _|

Although EROFS arranges compressed data like this, it typically maps two
individual virtual buffers so the relative order is uncertain.
Previously, it was hardly observed since LZ4 only uses memmove() for
short overlapped literals and x86/arm64 memmove implementations seem to
completely cover it up and they don't have this issue.  Juhyung reported

CVE-2021-47069	2024-03-01T22:15:46.857	2025-01-09T18:21:01.560	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipc/mqueue, msg, sem: avoid relying on a stack reference past its expiry

do_mq_timedreceive calls wq_sleep with a stack local address.  The
sender (do_mq_timedsend) uses this address to later call pipelined_send.

This leads to a very hard to trigger race where a do_mq_timedreceive
call might return and leave do_mq_timedsend to rely on an invalid
address, causing the following crash:

  RIP: 0010:wake_q_add_safe+0x13/0x60
  Call Trace:
   __x64_sys_mq_timedsend+0x2a9/0x490
   do_syscall_64+0x80/0x680
   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa9
  RIP: 0033:0x7f5928e40343

The race occurs as:

1. do_mq_timedreceive calls wq_sleep with the address of `struct
   ext_wait_queue` on function stack (aliased as `ewq_addr` here) - it
   holds a valid `struct ext_wait_queue *` as long as the stack has not
   been overwritten.

2. `ewq_addr` gets added to info->e_wait_q[RECV].list in wq_add, and
   do_mq_timedsend receives it via wq_get_first_waiter(info, RECV) to call
   __pipelined_op.

3. Sender calls __pipelined_op::smp_store_release(&this->state,
   STATE_READY).  Here is where the race window begins.  (`this` is
   `ewq_addr`.)

4. If the receiver wakes up now in do_mq_timedreceive::wq_sleep, it
   will see `state == STATE_READY` and break.

5. do_mq_timedreceive returns, and `ewq_addr` is no longer guaranteed
   to be a `struct ext_wait_queue *` since it was on do_mq_timedreceive's
   stack.  (Although the address may not get overwritten until another
   function happens to touch it, which means it can persist around for an
   indefinite time.)

6. do_mq_timedsend::__pipelined_op() still believes `ewq_addr` is a
   `struct ext_wait_queue *`, and uses it to find a task_struct to pass to
   the wake_q_add_safe call.  In the lucky case where nothing has
   overwritten `ewq_addr` yet, `ewq_addr->task` is the right task_struct.
   In the unlucky case, __pipelined_op::wake_q_add_safe gets handed a
   bogus address as the receiver's task_struct causing the crash.

do_mq_timedsend::__pipelined_op() should not dereference `this` after
setting STATE_READY, as the receiver counterpart is now free to return.
Change __pipelined_op to call wake_q_add_safe on the receiver's
task_struct returned by get_task_struct, instead of dereferencing `this`
which sits on the receiver's stack.

As Manfred pointed out, the race potentially also exists in
ipc/msg.c::expunge_all and ipc/sem.c::wake_up_sem_queue_prepare.  Fix
those in the same way."	7.0	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

btrfs: fix removed dentries still existing after log is synced

When we move one inode from one directory to another and both the inode
and its previous parent directory were logged before, we are not supposed
to have the dentry for the old parent if we have a power failure after the
log is synced. Only the new dentry is supposed to exist.

Generally this works correctly, however there is a scenario where this is
not currently working, because the old parent of the file/directory that
was moved is not authoritative for a range that includes the dir index and
dir item keys of the old dentry. This case is better explained with the
following example and reproducer:

  # The test requires a very specific layout of keys and items in the
  # fs/subvolume btree to trigger the bug. So we want to make sure that
  # on whatever platform we are, we have the same leaf/node size.
  #
  # Currently in btrfs the node/leaf size can not be smaller than the page
  # size (but it can be greater than the page size). So use the largest
  # supported node/leaf size (64K).

  $ mkfs.btrfs -f -n 65536 /dev/sdc
  $ mount /dev/sdc /mnt

  # ""testdir"" is inode 257.
  $ mkdir /mnt/testdir
  $ chmod 755 /mnt/testdir

  # Create several empty files to have the directory ""testdir"" with its
  # items spread over several leaves (7 in this case).
  $ for ((i = 1; i <= 1200; i++)); do
       echo -n > /mnt/testdir/file$i
    done

  # Create our test directory ""dira"", inode number 1458, which gets all
  # its items in leaf 7.
  #
  # The BTRFS_DIR_ITEM_KEY item for inode 257 (""testdir"") that points to
  # the entry named ""dira"" is in leaf 2, while the BTRFS_DIR_INDEX_KEY
  # item that points to that entry is in leaf 3.
  #
  # For this particular filesystem node size (64K), file count and file
  # names, we endup with the directory entry items from inode 257 in
  # leaves 2 and 3, as previously mentioned - what matters for triggering
  # the bug exercised by this test case is that those items are not placed
  # in leaf 1, they must be placed in a leaf different from the one
  # containing the inode item for inode 257.
  #
  # The corresponding BTRFS_DIR_ITEM_KEY and BTRFS_DIR_INDEX_KEY items for
  # the parent inode (257) are the following:
  #
  #    item 460 key (257 DIR_ITEM 3724298081) itemoff 48344 itemsize 34
  #         location key (1458 INODE_ITEM 0) type DIR
  #         transid 6 data_len 0 name_len 4
  #         name: dira
  #
  # and:
  #
  #    item 771 key (257 DIR_INDEX 1202) itemoff 36673 itemsize 34
  #         location key (1458 INODE_ITEM 0) type DIR
  #         transid 6 data_len 0 name_len 4
  #         name: dira

  $ mkdir /mnt/testdir/dira

  # Make sure everything done so far is durably persisted.
  $ sync

  # Now do a change to inode 257 (""testdir"") that does not result in
  # COWing leaves 2 and 3 - the leaves that contain the directory items
  # pointing to inode 1458 (directory ""dira"").
  #
  # Changing permissions, the owner/group, updating or adding a xattr,
  # etc, will not change (COW) leaves 2 and 3. So for the sake of
  # simplicity change the permissions of inode 257, which results in
  # updating its inode item and therefore change (COW) only leaf 1.

  $ chmod 700 /mnt/testdir

  # Now fsync directory inode 257.
  #
  # Since only the first leaf was changed/COWed, we log the inode item of
  # inode 257 and only the dentries found in the first leaf, all have a
  # key type of BTRFS_DIR_ITEM_KEY, and no keys of type

In gaudi_memset_device_memory, cb is get via hl_cb_kernel_create()

If hl_cs_allocate_job() failed, the execution runs into release_cb

vt: fix memory overlapping when deleting chars in the buffer

A memory overlapping copy occurs when deleting a long line. This memory
overlapping copy can cause data corruption when scr_memcpyw is optimized
to memcpy because memcpy does not ensure its behavior if the destination
buffer overlaps with the source buffer. The line buffer is not always
broken, because the memcpy utilizes the hardware acceleration, whose
result is not deterministic.

The problem is in ret_from_syscall where the check for
icache_44x_need_flush is done. When the flush is needed the code jumps
out-of-line to do the flush, and then intends to jump back to continue
the syscall return.

However the branch back to label 1b doesn't return to the correct
location, instead branching back just prior to the return to userspace,
causing bogus register values to be used by the rfi.

The breakage was introduced by commit 6f76a01173cc
(""powerpc/syscall: implement system call entry/exit logic in C for PPC32"") which
inadvertently removed the ""1"" label and reused it elsewhere.

Fix it by adding named local labels in the correct locations. Note that

The reason is early memblock_reserve() in memblock_init() set node id to
MAX_NUMNODES, making NODE_DATA(nid) a NULL dereference in the call chain
reserve_bootmem_region() -> init_reserved_page(). After memblock_init(),
those late calls of memblock_reserve() operate on subregions of memblock
.memory regions. As a result, these reserved regions will be set to the
correct node at the first iteration of memmap_init_reserved_pages().

So set all reserved memblocks on Node#0 at initialization can avoid this

spi: sun6i: fix race between DMA RX transfer completion and RX FIFO drain

Previously the transfer complete IRQ immediately drained to RX FIFO to
read any data remaining in FIFO to the RX buffer. This behaviour is
correct when dealing with SPI in interrupt mode. However in DMA mode the
transfer complete interrupt still fires as soon as all bytes to be
transferred have been stored in the FIFO. At that point data in the FIFO
still needs to be picked up by the DMA engine. Thus the drain procedure
and DMA engine end up racing to read from RX FIFO, corrupting any data
read. Additionally the RX buffer pointer is never adjusted according to
DMA progress in DMA mode, thus calling the RX FIFO drain procedure in DMA
mode is a bug.
Fix corruptions in DMA RX mode by draining RX FIFO only in interrupt mode.
Also wait for completion of RX DMA when in DMA mode before returning to

ipv4, ipv6: Fix handling of transhdrlen in __ip{,6}_append_data()

Including the transhdrlen in length is a problem when the packet is
partially filled (e.g. something like send(MSG_MORE) happened previously)
when appending to an IPv4 or IPv6 packet as we don't want to repeat the
transport header or account for it twice.  This can happen under some
circumstances, such as splicing into an L2TP socket.

The symptom observed is a warning in __ip6_append_data():

    WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 5042 at net/ipv6/ip6_output.c:1800 __ip6_append_data.isra.0+0x1be8/0x47f0 net/ipv6/ip6_output.c:1800

that occurs when MSG_SPLICE_PAGES is used to append more data to an already
partially occupied skbuff.  The warning occurs when 'copy' is larger than
the amount of data in the message iterator.  This is because the requested
length includes the transport header length when it shouldn't.  This can be
triggered by, for example:

        sfd = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_L2TP);
        bind(sfd, ...); // ::1
        connect(sfd, ...); // ::1 port 7
        send(sfd, buffer, 4100, MSG_MORE);
        sendfile(sfd, dfd, NULL, 1024);

Fix this by only adding transhdrlen into the length if the write queue is
empty in l2tp_ip6_sendmsg(), analogously to how UDP does things.

l2tp_ip_sendmsg() looks like it won't suffer from this problem as it builds
the UDP packet itself."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

mm/slab_common: fix slab_caches list corruption after kmem_cache_destroy()

After the commit in Fixes:, if a module that created a slab cache does not
release all of its allocated objects before destroying the cache (at rmmod
time), we might end up releasing the kmem_cache object without removing it
from the slab_caches list thus corrupting the list as kmem_cache_destroy()
ignores the return value from shutdown_cache(), which in turn never removes
the kmem_cache object from slabs_list in case __kmem_cache_shutdown() fails
to release all of the cache's slabs.

This is easily observable on a kernel built with CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST=y
as after that ill release the system will immediately trip on list_add,
or list_del, assertions similar to the one shown below as soon as another

Revert ""tty: n_gsm: fix UAF in gsm_cleanup_mux""

This reverts commit 9b9c8195f3f0d74a826077fc1c01b9ee74907239.

The commit above is reverted as it did not solve the original issue.

gsm_cleanup_mux() tries to free up the virtual ttys by calling
gsm_dlci_release() for each available DLCI. There, dlci_put() is called to
decrease the reference counter for the DLCI via tty_port_put() which
finally calls gsm_dlci_free(). This already clears the pointer which is
being checked in gsm_cleanup_mux() before calling gsm_dlci_release().
Therefore, it is not necessary to clear this pointer in gsm_cleanup_mux()
as done in the reverted commit. The commit introduces a null pointer
dereference:

nilfs2: fix potential use after free in nilfs_gccache_submit_read_data()

In nilfs_gccache_submit_read_data(), brelse(bh) is called to drop the
reference count of bh when the call to nilfs_dat_translate() fails.  If
the reference count hits 0 and its owner page gets unlocked, bh may be
freed.  However, bh->b_page is dereferenced to put the page after that,
which may result in a use-after-free bug.  This patch moves the release
operation after unlocking and putting the page.

NOTE: The function in question is only called in GC, and in combination
with current userland tools, address translation using DAT does not occur
in that function, so the code path that causes this issue will not be
executed.  However, it is possible to run that code path by intentionally
modifying the userland GC library or by calling the GC ioctl directly.

x86/sgx: Resolves SECS reclaim vs. page fault for EAUG race

The SGX EPC reclaimer (ksgxd) may reclaim the SECS EPC page for an
enclave and set secs.epc_page to NULL. The SECS page is used for EAUG
and ELDU in the SGX page fault handler. However, the NULL check for
secs.epc_page is only done for ELDU, not EAUG before being used.

Fix this by doing the same NULL check and reloading of the SECS page as
needed for both EAUG and ELDU.

The SECS page holds global enclave metadata. It can only be reclaimed
when there are no other enclave pages remaining. At that point,
virtually nothing can be done with the enclave until the SECS page is
paged back in.

An enclave can not run nor generate page faults without a resident SECS
page. But it is still possible for a #PF for a non-SECS page to race
with paging out the SECS page: when the last resident non-SECS page A
triggers a #PF in a non-resident page B, and then page A and the SECS
both are paged out before the #PF on B is handled.

Hitting this bug requires that race triggered with a #PF for EAUG.
Following is a trace when it happens.

Instead of calling BUG() when we fail to insert a delayed dir index item

have allocated/acquired before and return the error to the caller. This is
fine because all existing call chains undo anything they have done before
calling btrfs_insert_delayed_dir_index() or BUG_ON (when creating pending
snapshots in the transaction commit path).

So remove the BUG() call and do proper error handling.

When enslave a vlan device to team device and team device type is changed
from non-ether to ether, header_ops of team device is changed to
vlan_header_ops. That is incorrect and will trigger null-ptr-deref
for vlan->real_dev in vlan_dev_hard_header() because team device is not
a vlan device.

Cache eth_header_ops in team_setup(), then assign cached header_ops to
header_ops of team net device when its type is changed from non-ether

net/core: Fix ETH_P_1588 flow dissector

When a PTP ethernet raw frame with a size of more than 256 bytes followed
by a 0xff pattern is sent to __skb_flow_dissect, nhoff value calculation
is wrong. For example: hdr->message_length takes the wrong value (0xffff)
and it does not replicate real header length. In this case, 'nhoff' value
was overridden and the PTP header was badly dissected. This leads to a
kernel crash.

net/core: flow_dissector
net/core flow dissector nhoff = 0x0000000e
net/core flow dissector hdr->message_length = 0x0000ffff
net/core flow dissector nhoff = 0x0001000d (u16 overflow)

Using the size of the ptp_header struct will allow the corrected

netfilter: nf_tables: fix memleak when more than 255 elements expired

When more than 255 elements expired we're supposed to switch to a new gc
container structure.

This never happens: u8 type will wrap before reaching the boundary
and nft_trans_gc_space() always returns true.

CVE-2023-52582	2024-03-02T22:15:49.770	2025-01-16T17:33:18.490	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfs: Only call folio_start_fscache() one time for each folio

If a network filesystem using netfs implements a clamp_length()
function, it can set subrequest lengths smaller than a page size.

When we loop through the folios in netfs_rreq_unlock_folios() to
set any folios to be written back, we need to make sure we only
call folio_start_fscache() once for each folio.

Otherwise, this simple testcase:

  mount -o fsc,rsize=1024,wsize=1024 127.0.0.1:/export /mnt/nfs
  dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/nfs/file.bin bs=4096 count=1

  echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
  cat /mnt/nfs/file.bin > /dev/null

	cat /sys/kernel/debug/kfence/objects
	echo scan > /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak

The leaked memory is allocated in the stack below:

      do_sys_open
        do_dentry_open
          full_proxy_open

      syscall_exit_to_user_mode
        exit_to_user_mode_prepare
          task_work_run
            ____fput
              __fput
                full_proxy_release  ---> free here

However, the release function corresponding to file_operations is not
implemented in kfence.  As a result, a memory leak occurs.  Therefore,
the solution to this problem is to implement the corresponding release
function."	3.3	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

KVM: VMX: Always clear vmx->fail on emulation_required

Revert a relatively recent change that set vmx->fail if the vCPU is in L2
and emulation_required is true, as that behavior is completely bogus.
Setting vmx->fail and synthesizing a VM-Exit is contradictory and wrong:

  (a) it's impossible to have both a VM-Fail and VM-Exit
  (b) vmcs.EXIT_REASON is not modified on VM-Fail
  (c) emulation_required refers to guest state and guest state checks are
      always VM-Exits, not VM-Fails.

For KVM specifically, emulation_required is handled before nested exits
in __vmx_handle_exit(), thus setting vmx->fail has no immediate effect,
i.e. KVM calls into handle_invalid_guest_state() and vmx->fail is ignored.
Setting vmx->fail can ultimately result in a WARN in nested_vmx_vmexit()
firing when tearing down the VM as KVM never expects vmx->fail to be set
when L2 is active, KVM always reflects those errors into L1.

KVM: x86/mmu: Don't advance iterator after restart due to yielding

After dropping mmu_lock in the TDP MMU, restart the iterator during
tdp_iter_next() and do not advance the iterator.  Advancing the iterator
results in skipping the top-level SPTE and all its children, which is
fatal if any of the skipped SPTEs were not visited before yielding.

When zapping all SPTEs, i.e. when min_level == root_level, restarting the
iter and then invoking tdp_iter_next() is always fatal if the current gfn
has as a valid SPTE, as advancing the iterator results in try_step_side()
skipping the current gfn, which wasn't visited before yielding.

Sprinkle WARNs on iter->yielded being true in various helpers that are
often used in conjunction with yielding, and tag the helper with
__must_check to reduce the probabily of improper usage.

Failing to zap a top-level SPTE manifests in one of two ways.  If a valid
SPTE is skipped by both kvm_tdp_mmu_zap_all() and kvm_tdp_mmu_put_root(),
the shadow page will be leaked and KVM will WARN accordingly.

If kvm_tdp_mmu_zap_all() skips a gfn/SPTE but that SPTE is then zapped by
kvm_tdp_mmu_put_root(), KVM triggers a use-after-free in the form of
marking a struct page as dirty/accessed after it has been put back on the
free list.  This directly triggers a WARN due to encountering a page with
page_count() == 0, but it can also lead to data corruption and additional
errors in the kernel.

Note, the underlying bug existed even before commit 1af4a96025b3 (""KVM:
x86/mmu: Yield in TDU MMU iter even if no SPTES changed"") moved calls to
tdp_mmu_iter_cond_resched() to the beginning of loops, as KVM could still
incorrectly advance past a top-level entry when yielding on a lower-level
entry.  But with respect to leaking shadow pages, the bug was introduced
by yielding before processing the current gfn.

Alternatively, tdp_mmu_iter_cond_resched() could simply fall through, or
callers could jump to their ""retry"" label.  The downside of that approach
is that tdp_mmu_iter_cond_resched() _must_ be called before anything else
in the loop, and there's no easy way to enfornce that requirement.

Ideally, KVM would handling the cond_resched() fully within the iterator
macro (the code is actually quite clean) and avoid this entire class of
bugs, but that is extremely difficult do wh

inet: fully convert sk->sk_rx_dst to RCU rules

syzbot reported various issues around early demux,
one being included in this changelog [1]

sk->sk_rx_dst is using RCU protection without clearly
documenting it.

And following sequences in tcp_v4_do_rcv()/tcp_v6_do_rcv()
are not following standard RCU rules.

[a]    dst_release(dst);
[b]    sk->sk_rx_dst = NULL;

They look wrong because a delete operation of RCU protected
pointer is supposed to clear the pointer before
the call_rcu()/synchronize_rcu() guarding actual memory freeing.

In some cases indeed, dst could be freed before [b] is done.

We could cheat by clearing sk_rx_dst before calling
dst_release(), but this seems the right time to stick
to standard RCU annotations and debugging facilities.

NFSD: Fix READDIR buffer overflow

If a client sends a READDIR count argument that is too small (say,
zero), then the buffer size calculation in the new init_dirlist
helper functions results in an underflow, allowing the XDR stream
functions to write beyond the actual buffer.

This calculation has always been suspect. NFSD has never sanity-
checked the READDIR count argument, but the old entry encoders
managed the problem correctly.

With the commits below, entry encoding changed, exposing the
underflow to the pointer arithmetic in xdr_reserve_space().

Modern NFS clients attempt to retrieve as much data as possible
for each READDIR request. Also, we have no unit tests that
exercise the behavior of READDIR at the lower bound of @count
values. Thus this case was missed during testing."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

drm/mediatek: hdmi: Perform NULL pointer check for mtk_hdmi_conf

In commit 41ca9caaae0b
(""drm/mediatek: hdmi: Add check for CEA modes only"") a check
for CEA modes was added to function mtk_hdmi_bridge_mode_valid()
in order to address possible issues on MT8167;
moreover, with commit c91026a938c2
(""drm/mediatek: hdmi: Add optional limit on maximal HDMI mode clock"")
another similar check was introduced.

Unfortunately though, at the time of writing, MT8173 does not provide
any mtk_hdmi_conf structure and this is crashing the kernel with NULL
pointer upon entering mtk_hdmi_bridge_mode_valid(), which happens as
soon as a HDMI cable gets plugged in.

To fix this regression, add a NULL pointer check for hdmi->conf in the
said function, restoring HDMI functionality and avoiding NULL pointer
kernel panics."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2022-48629	2024-03-05T12:15:45.707	2025-02-26T07:00:18.270	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: qcom-rng - ensure buffer for generate is completely filled

The generate function in struct rng_alg expects that the destination
buffer is completely filled if the function returns 0. qcom_rng_read()
can run into a situation where the buffer is partially filled with
randomness and the remaining part of the buffer is zeroed since
qcom_rng_generate() doesn't check the return value. This issue can
be reproduced by running the following from libkcapi:

    kcapi-rng -b 9000000 > OUTFILE

The generated OUTFILE will have three huge sections that contain all
zeros, and this is caused by the code where the test
'val & PRNG_STATUS_DATA_AVAIL' fails.

Let's fix this issue by ensuring that qcom_rng_read() always returns
with a full buffer if the function returns success. Let's also have
qcom_rng_generate() return the correct value.

Here's some statistics from the ent project
(https://www.fourmilab.ch/random/) that shows information about the
quality of the generated numbers:

IB/ipoib: Fix mcast list locking

Releasing the `priv->lock` while iterating the `priv->multicast_list` in

remove the items while in the middle of iteration. If the mcast is removed

                                       |   ipoib_mcast_remove_list(&remove_list)
   (Here, `mcast` is no longer on the  |     list_for_each_entry_safe(mcast, tmcast,

    the other thread which is blocked  |
    and the list is still valid on     |
    it's stack.)

Fix this by keeping the lock held and changing to GFP_ATOMIC to prevent
eventual sleeps.
Unfortunately we could not reproduce the lockup and confirm this fix but
based on the code review I think this fix should address such lockups.

media: rkisp1: Fix IRQ disable race issue

In rkisp1_isp_stop() and rkisp1_csi_disable() the driver masks the
interrupts and then apparently assumes that the interrupt handler won't
be running, and proceeds in the stop procedure. This is not the case, as
the interrupt handler can already be running, which would lead to the
ISP being disabled while the interrupt handler handling a captured
frame.

This brings up two issues: 1) the ISP could be powered off while the
interrupt handler is still running and accessing registers, leading to
board lockup, and 2) the interrupt handler code and the code that
disables the streaming might do things that conflict.

It is not clear to me if 2) causes a real issue, but 1) can be seen with
a suitable delay (or printk in my case) in the interrupt handler,

KVM: s390: fix setting of fpc register

kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_set_fpu() allows to set the floating point control
(fpc) register of a guest cpu. The new value is tested for validity by
temporarily loading it into the fpc register.

This may lead to corruption of the fpc register of the host process:
if an interrupt happens while the value is temporarily loaded into the fpc
register, and within interrupt context floating point or vector registers
are used, the current fp/vx registers are saved with save_fpu_regs()
assuming they belong to user space and will be loaded into fp/vx registers
when returning to user space.

test_fp_ctl() restores the original user space / host process fpc register
value, however it will be discarded, when returning to user space.

In result the host process will incorrectly continue to run with the value
that was supposed to be used for a guest cpu.

Fix this by simply removing the test. There is another test right before
the SIE context is entered which will handles invalid values.

This results in a change of behaviour: invalid values will now be accepted
instead of that the ioctl fails with -EINVAL. This seems to be acceptable,
given that this interface is most likely not used anymore, and this is in
addition the same behaviour implemented with the memory mapped interface
(replace invalid values with zero) - see sync_regs() in kvm-s390.c."	4.0	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L

solves this issue.

Dave:
As the function returns a void, good error handling
would require a more intrusive code reorganization, so I modified
Osama's patch at use WARN_ON_ONCE for lack of a cleaner option.

The patch is tested via syzbot."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

pds_core: Prevent race issues involving the adminq

There are multiple paths that can result in using the pdsc's
adminq.

[1] pdsc_adminq_isr and the resulting work from queue_work(),
    i.e. pdsc_work_thread()->pdsc_process_adminq()

[2] pdsc_adminq_post()

When the device goes through reset via PCIe reset and/or
a fw_down/fw_up cycle due to bad PCIe state or bad device
state the adminq is destroyed and recreated.

A NULL pointer dereference can happen if [1] or [2] happens
after the adminq is already destroyed.

In order to fix this, add some further state checks and
implement reference counting for adminq uses. Reference
counting was used because multiple threads can attempt to
access the adminq at the same time via [1] or [2]. Additionally,
multiple clients (i.e. pds-vfio-pci) can be using [2]
at the same time.

The adminq_refcnt is initialized to 1 when the adminq has been
allocated and is ready to use. Users/clients of the adminq
(i.e. [1] and [2]) will increment the refcnt when they are using
the adminq. When the driver goes into a fw_down cycle it will
set the PDSC_S_FW_DEAD bit and then wait for the adminq_refcnt
to hit 1. Setting the PDSC_S_FW_DEAD before waiting will prevent
any further adminq_refcnt increments. Waiting for the
adminq_refcnt to hit 1 allows for any current users of the adminq
to finish before the driver frees the adminq. Once the
adminq_refcnt hits 1 the driver clears the refcnt to signify that
the adminq is deleted and cannot be used. On the fw_up cycle the
driver will once again initialize the adminq_refcnt to 1 allowing
the adminq to be used again."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

scsi: core: Move scsi_host_busy() out of host lock for waking up EH handler

Inside scsi_eh_wakeup(), scsi_host_busy() is called & checked with host
lock every time for deciding if error handler kthread needs to be waken up.

This can be too heavy in case of recovery, such as:

 - N hardware queues

 - queue depth is M for each hardware queue

 - each scsi_host_busy() iterates over (N * M) tag/requests

If recovery is triggered in case that all requests are in-flight, each
scsi_eh_wakeup() is strictly serialized, when scsi_eh_wakeup() is called
for the last in-flight request, scsi_host_busy() has been run for (N * M -
1) times, and request has been iterated for (N*M - 1) * (N * M) times.

If both N and M are big enough, hard lockup can be triggered on acquiring
host lock, and it is observed on mpi3mr(128 hw queues, queue depth 8169).

Fix the issue by calling scsi_host_busy() outside the host lock. We don't
need the host lock for getting busy count because host the lock never
covers that.

When `xmlsec1` is used without defining the enabled key data, the origin of the public key for the signature verification is, unfortunately, not restricted. That means an attacker can sign the SAML assertions themselves and provide the required public key (e.g. an RSA key) directly embedded in the SAML token. Projects still using RobotsAndPencils/go-saml should move to another SAML library or alternatively remove support for SAML from their projects. The vulnerability can likely temporarily be fixed by forking the go-saml project and adding the command line argument `--enabled-key-data` and specifying a value such as `x509` or `raw-x509-cert` when calling the `xmlsec1` binary in the verify function. Please note that this workaround must be carefully tested before it can be used.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2024-27307	2024-03-06T20:15:47.537	2024-11-21T09:04:17.667	JSONata is a JSON query and transformation language. Starting in version 1.4.0 and prior to version 1.8.7 and 2.0.4, a malicious expression can use the transform operator to override properties on the `Object` constructor and prototype. This may lead to denial of service, remote code execution or other unexpected behavior in applications that evaluate user-provided JSONata expressions. This issue has been fixed in JSONata versions 1.8.7 and 2.0.4. Applications that evaluate user-provided expressions should update ASAP to prevent exploitation. As a workaround, one may apply the patch manually.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2024-27308	2024-03-06T20:15:47.730	2024-11-21T09:04:17.800	Mio is a Metal I/O library for Rust. When using named pipes on Windows, mio will under some circumstances return invalid tokens that correspond to named pipes that have already been deregistered from the mio registry. The impact of this vulnerability depends on how mio is used. For some applications, invalid tokens may be ignored or cause a warning or a crash. On the other hand, for applications that store pointers in the tokens, this vulnerability may result in a use-after-free. For users of Tokio, this vulnerability is serious and can result in a use-after-free in Tokio. The vulnerability is Windows-specific, and can only happen if you are using named pipes. Other IO resources are not affected. This vulnerability has been fixed in mio v0.8.11. All versions of mio between v0.7.2 and v0.8.10 are vulnerable. Tokio is vulnerable when you are using a vulnerable version of mio AND you are using at least Tokio v1.30.0. Versions of Tokio prior to v1.30.0 will ignore invalid tokens, so they are not vulnerable. Vulnerable libraries that use mio can work around this issue by detecting and ignoring invalid tokens.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2024-27915	2024-03-06T20:15:47.930	2025-01-08T18:37:37.653	Sulu is a PHP content management system. Starting in verson 2.2.0 and prior to version 2.4.17 and 2.5.13, access to pages is granted regardless of role permissions for webspaces which have a security system configured and permission check enabled. Webspaces without do not have this issue. The problem is patched in versions 2.4.17 and 2.5.13. Some workarounds are available. One may apply the patch to `vendor/symfony/security-http/HttpUtils.php` manually or avoid installing `symfony/security-http` versions greater equal than `v5.4.30` or `v6.3.6`.	6.8	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2024-27917	2024-03-06T20:15:48.120	2025-09-10T15:17:23.777	Shopware is an open commerce platform based on Symfony Framework and Vue. The Symfony Session Handler pops the Session Cookie and assigns it to the Response. Since Shopware 6.5.8.0, the 404 pages are cached to improve the performance of 404 pages. So the cached Response which contains a Session Cookie when the Browser accessing the 404 page, has no cookies yet. The Symfony Session Handler is in use, when no explicit Session configuration has been done. When Redis is in use for Sessions using the PHP Redis extension, this exploiting code is not used. Shopware version 6.5.8.7 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, use Redis for Sessions, as this does not trigger the exploit code.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

CVE-2024-1931	2024-03-07T10:15:07.037	2024-12-17T16:56:50.630	NLnet Labs Unbound version 1.18.0 up to and including version 1.19.1 contain a vulnerability that can cause denial of service by a certain code path that can lead to an infinite loop. Unbound 1.18.0 introduced a feature that removes EDE records from responses with size higher than the client's advertised buffer size. Before removing all the EDE records however, it would try to see if trimming the extra text fields on those records would result in an acceptable size while still retaining the EDE codes. Due to an unchecked condition, the code that trims the text of the EDE records could loop indefinitely. This happens when Unbound would reply with attached EDE information on a positive reply and the client's buffer size is smaller than the needed space to include EDE records. The vulnerability can only be triggered when the 'ede: yes' option is used; non default configuration. From version 1.19.2 on, the code is fixed to avoid looping indefinitely.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

drm: Don't unref the same fb many times by mistake due to deadlock handling

If we get a deadlock after the fb lookup in drm_mode_page_flip_ioctl()
we proceed to unref the fb and then retry the whole thing from the top.
But we forget to reset the fb pointer back to NULL, and so if we then
get another error during the retry, before the fb lookup, we proceed
the unref the same fb again without having gotten another reference.
The end result is that the fb will (eventually) end up being freed
while it's still in use.

Reset fb to NULL once we've unreffed it to avoid doing it again
until we've done another fb lookup.

This turned out to be pretty easy to hit on a DG2 when doing async
flips (and CONFIG_DEBUG_WW_MUTEX_SLOWPATH=y). The first symptom I
saw that drm_closefb() simply got stuck in a busy loop while walking
the framebuffer list. Fortunately I was able to convince it to oops
instead, and from there it was easier to track down the culprit."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

net/mlx5e: Fix peer flow lists handling

The cited change refactored mlx5e_tc_del_fdb_peer_flow() to only clear DUP
flag when list of peer flows has become empty. However, if any concurrent
user holds a reference to a peer flow (for example, the neighbor update
workqueue task is updating peer flow's parent encap entry concurrently),
then the flow will not be removed from the peer list and, consecutively,
DUP flag will remain set. Since mlx5e_tc_del_fdb_peers_flow() calls
mlx5e_tc_del_fdb_peer_flow() for every possible peer index the algorithm
will try to remove the flow from eswitch instances that it has never peered
with causing either NULL pointer dereference when trying to remove the flow
peer list head of peer_index that was never initialized or a warning if the
list debug config is enabled[0].

Fix the issue by always removing the peer flow from the list even when not
releasing the last reference to it.

serial: sc16is7xx: convert from _raw_ to _noinc_ regmap functions for FIFO

The SC16IS7XX IC supports a burst mode to access the FIFOs where the
initial register address is sent ($00), followed by all the FIFO data
without having to resend the register address each time. In this mode, the
IC doesn't increment the register address for each R/W byte.

The regmap_raw_read() and regmap_raw_write() are functions which can
perform IO over multiple registers. They are currently used to read/write
from/to the FIFO, and although they operate correctly in this burst mode on
the SPI bus, they would corrupt the regmap cache if it was not disabled
manually. The reason is that when the R/W size is more than 1 byte, these
functions assume that the register address is incremented and handle the
cache accordingly.

Convert FIFO R/W functions to use the regmap _noinc_ versions in order to
remove the manual cache control which was a workaround when using the
_raw_ versions. FIFO registers are properly declared as volatile so
cache will not be used/updated for FIFO accesses."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

mm/sparsemem: fix race in accessing memory_section->usage

The below race is observed on a PFN which falls into the device memory
region with the system memory configuration where PFN's are such that
[ZONE_NORMAL ZONE_DEVICE ZONE_NORMAL].  Since normal zone start and end
pfn contains the device memory PFN's as well, the compaction triggered
will try on the device memory PFN's too though they end up in NOP(because
pfn_to_online_page() returns NULL for ZONE_DEVICE memory sections).  When
from other core, the section mappings are being removed for the
ZONE_DEVICE region, that the PFN in question belongs to, on which
compaction is currently being operated is resulting into the kernel crash
with CONFIG_SPASEMEM_VMEMAP enabled.  The crash logs can be seen at [1].

compact_zone()			memunmap_pages
-------------			---------------
__pageblock_pfn_to_page

     valid_section()//return true
			      (b)__remove_pages()->

				    [Free the array ms->usage and set
				     ms->usage = NULL]
     pfn_section_valid()
     [Access ms->usage which
     is NULL]

NOTE: From the above it can be said that the race is reduced to between
the pfn_valid()/pfn_section_valid() and the section deactivate with
SPASEMEM_VMEMAP enabled.

The commit b943f045a9af(""mm/sparse: fix kernel crash with
pfn_section_valid check"") tried to address the same problem by clearing
the SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP with the expectation of valid_section() returns
false thus ms->usage is not accessed.

Fix this issue by the below steps:

a) Clear SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP before freeing the ->usage.

b) RCU protected read side critical section will either return NULL
   when SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP is cleared or can successfully access ->usage.

c) Free the ->usage with kfree_rcu() and set ms->usage = NULL.  No
   attempt will be made to access ->usage after this as the
   SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP is cleared thus valid_section() return false.

Thanks to David/Pavan for their inputs on this patch.

After analyzing the vmcore, I found this issue is caused by page migration.
The scenario is that, one thread is doing page migration, and we will use the
target page's ->mapping field to save 'anon_vma' pointer between page unmap and
page move, and now the target page is locked and refcount is 1.

Currently, there is another stress-ng thread performing memory hotplug,
attempting to offline the target page that is being migrated. It discovers that
the refcount of this target page is 1, preventing the offline operation, thus
proceeding to dump the page. However, page_mapping() of the target page may
return an incorrect file mapping to crash the system in dump_mapping(), since
the target page->mapping only saves 'anon_vma' pointer without setting
PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag.

There are seveval ways to fix this issue:
(1) Setting the PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag for target page's ->mapping when saving
'anon_vma', but this can confuse PageAnon() for PFN walkers, since the target
page has not built mappings yet.
(2) Getting the page lock to call page_mapping() in __dump_page() to avoid crashing
the system, however, there are still some PFN walkers that call page_mapping()
without holding the page lock, such as compaction.
(3) Using target page->private field to save the 'anon_vma' pointer and 2 bits
page state, just as page->mapping records an anonymous page, which can remove

media: mtk-jpeg: Fix use after free bug due to error path handling in mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run

In mtk_jpeg_probe, &jpeg->job_timeout_work is bound with
mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work.

In mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run, if error happens in
mtk_jpeg_set_dec_dst, it will finally start the worker while
mark the job as finished by invoking v4l2_m2m_job_finish.

There are two methods to trigger the bug. If we remove the
module, it which will call mtk_jpeg_remove to make cleanup.
The possible sequence is as follows, which will cause a
use-after-free bug.

CPU0                  CPU1
mtk_jpeg_dec_...    |
  start worker	    |
                    |mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work
mtk_jpeg_remove     |

    kfree(m2m_dev); |

                    |   m2m_dev->curr_ctx //use

If we close the file descriptor, which will call mtk_jpeg_release,
it will have a similar sequence.

Fix this bug by starting timeout worker only if started jpegdec worker
successfully. Then v4l2_m2m_job_finish will only be called in
either mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work or mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

PM: sleep: Fix possible deadlocks in core system-wide PM code

It is reported that in low-memory situations the system-wide resume core
code deadlocks, because async_schedule_dev() executes its argument
function synchronously if it cannot allocate memory (and not only in
that case) and that function attempts to acquire a mutex that is already
held.  Executing the argument function synchronously from within
dpm_async_fn() may also be problematic for ordering reasons (it may
cause a consumer device's resume callback to be invoked before a
requisite supplier device's one, for example).

Address this by changing the code in question to use
async_schedule_dev_nocall() for scheduling the asynchronous
execution of device suspend and resume functions and to directly

- Crash, mostly due to above use-after-free

[CAUSE]
The converted fs has the following data chunk layout:

    item 2 key (FIRST_CHUNK_TREE CHUNK_ITEM 2214658048) itemoff 16025 itemsize 80
        length 86016 owner 2 stripe_len 65536 type DATA|single

For above logical bytenr 2214744064, it's at the chunk end
(2214658048 + 86016 = 2214744064).

This means btrfs_submit_bio() would split the bio, and trigger endio
function for both of the two halves.

However scrub_submit_initial_read() would only expect the endio function
to be called once, not any more.
This means the first endio function would already free the bbio::bio,
leaving the bvec freed, thus the 2nd endio call would lead to
use-after-free.

[FIX]
- Make sure scrub_read_endio() only updates bits in its range
  Since we may read less than 64K at the end of the chunk, we should not
  touch the bits beyond chunk boundary.

- Make sure scrub_submit_initial_read() only to read the chunk range
  This is done by calculating the real number of sectors we need to
  read, and add sector-by-sector to the bio.

Thankfully the scrub read repair path won't need extra fixes:

- scrub_stripe_submit_repair_read()
  With above fixes, we won't update error bit for range beyond chunk,
  thus scrub_stripe_submit_repair_read() should never submit any read
  beyond the chunk."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

s390/vfio-ap: always filter entire AP matrix

The vfio_ap_mdev_filter_matrix function is called whenever a new adapter or
domain is assigned to the mdev. The purpose of the function is to update
the guest's AP configuration by filtering the matrix of adapters and
domains assigned to the mdev. When an adapter or domain is assigned, only
the APQNs associated with the APID of the new adapter or APQI of the new
domain are inspected. If an APQN does not reference a queue device bound to
the vfio_ap device driver, then it's APID will be filtered from the mdev's
matrix when updating the guest's AP configuration.

Inspecting only the APID of the new adapter or APQI of the new domain will
result in passing AP queues through to a guest that are not bound to the
vfio_ap device driver under certain circumstances. Consider the following:

guest's AP configuration (all also assigned to the mdev's matrix):
14.0004
14.0005
14.0006
16.0004
16.0005
16.0006

unassign domain 4
unbind queue 16.0005
assign domain 4

When domain 4 is re-assigned, since only domain 4 will be inspected, the
APQNs that will be examined will be:
14.0004
16.0004

Since both of those APQNs reference queue devices that are bound to the
vfio_ap device driver, nothing will get filtered from the mdev's matrix
when updating the guest's AP configuration. Consequently, queue 16.0005
will get passed through despite not being bound to the driver. This
violates the linux device model requirement that a guest shall only be
given access to devices bound to the device driver facilitating their
pass-through.

To resolve this problem, every adapter and domain assigned to the mdev will
be inspected when filtering the mdev's matrix."	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-28197	2024-03-11T20:15:07.420	2025-01-07T15:54:40.987	Zitadel is an open source identity management system. Zitadel uses a cookie to identify the user agent (browser) and its user sessions.  Although the cookie was handled according to best practices, it was accessible on subdomains of the ZITADEL instance. An attacker could take advantage of this and provide a malicious link hosted on the subdomain to the user to gain access to the victim’s account in certain scenarios. A possible victim would need to login through the malicious link for this exploit to work. If the possible victim already had the cookie present, the attack would not succeed. The attack would further only be possible if there was an initial vulnerability on the subdomain. This could either be the attacker being able to control DNS or a XSS vulnerability in an application hosted on a subdomain. Versions 2.46.0, 2.45.1, and 2.44.3 have been patched. Zitadel recommends upgrading to the latest versions available in due course. Note that applying the patch will invalidate the current cookie and thus users will need to start a new session and existing sessions (user selection) will be empty. For self-hosted environments unable to upgrade to a patched version, prevent setting the following cookie name on subdomains of your Zitadel instance (e.g. within your WAF): `__Secure-zitadel-useragent`.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N

This was due to improper case-sensitivity in the code that was meant to prevent these attacks. If you render an `<a>` tag with an `href` attribute set to a user-provided link, that link could potentially execute JavaScript when clicked by another user. If you splat user-provided attributes when rendering any HTML tag, malicious event attributes could be included in the output, executing JavaScript when the events are triggered by another user. Patches are available on RubyGems for all 1.x minor versions. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should consider configuring a content security policy that does not allow `unsafe-inline`.	7.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N

Each QUIC connection possesses a set of connection Identifiers (IDs); see  RFC 9000 Section 5.1 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-5.1 . Endpoints declare the number of active connection IDs they are willing to support using the active_connection_id_limit transport parameter. The peer can create new IDs using a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame but must stay within the active ID limit. This is done by retirement of old IDs, the endpoint sends NEW_CONNECTION_ID includes a value in the retire_prior_to field, which elicits a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame as confirmation. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames and manipulating the connection (e.g. by restricting the peer's congestion window size) so that RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames can only be sent at a slower rate than they are received, leading to storage of information related to connection IDs in an unbounded queue.

The known risks include exposing sensitive information such as connected client IP and unauthorized logging level manipulation which could lead to a denial-of-service condition by significantly increasing the proxy's logging overhead. When deployed via the Apache Pulsar Helm chart within Kubernetes environments, the actual client IP might not be revealed through the load balancer's default behavior, which typically obscures the original source IP addresses when externalTrafficPolicy is being configured to ""Cluster"" by default.

Vela pipelines can use variable substitution combined with insensitive fields like `parameters`, `image` and `entrypoint` to inject secrets into a plugin/image and — by using common substitution string manipulation — can bypass log masking and expose secrets without the use of the commands block. This unexpected behavior primarily impacts secrets restricted by the ""no commands"" option. This can lead to unintended use of the secret value, and increased risk of exposing the secret during image execution bypassing log masking. **To exploit this** the pipeline author must be supplying the secrets to a plugin that is designed in such a way that will print those parameters in logs. Plugin parameters are not designed for sensitive values and are often intentionally printed throughout execution for informational/debugging purposes. Parameters should therefore be treated as insensitive. While Vela provides secrets masking, secrets exposure is not entirely solved by the masking process. A docker image (plugin) can easily expose secrets if they are not handled properly, or altered in some way. There is a responsibility on the end-user to understand how values injected into a plugin are used. This is a risk that exists for many CICD systems (like GitHub Actions) that handle sensitive runtime variables. Rather, the greater risk is that users who restrict a secret to the ""no commands"" option and use image restriction can still have their secret value exposed via substitution tinkering, which turns the image and command restrictions into a false sense of security. This issue has been addressed in version 0.23.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not provide sensitive values to plugins that can potentially expose them, especially in `parameters` that are not intended to be used for sensitive values, ensure plugins (especially those that utilize shared secrets) follow best practices to avoid logging parameters that are expected to be sensitive, minimize secrets with `pull_request` events enabled, as this allows users to change pipeline configurations and pull in secrets to steps not typically part of the CI process, make use of the build approval setting, restricting builds from untrusted users, and limit use of shared secrets, as they are less restrictive to access by nature."	7.7	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2024-28238	2024-03-12T21:15:59.297	2025-01-03T16:14:55.823	Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When reaching the /files page, a JWT is passed via GET request. Inclusion of session tokens in URLs poses a security risk as URLs are often logged in various places (e.g., web server logs, browser history). Attackers gaining access to these logs may hijack active user sessions, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information or actions on behalf of the user. This issue has been addressed in version 10.10.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	2.3	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

firmware: arm_scmi: Check mailbox/SMT channel for consistency

On reception of a completion interrupt the shared memory area is accessed
to retrieve the message header at first and then, if the message sequence
number identifies a transaction which is still pending, the related
payload is fetched too.

When an SCMI command times out the channel ownership remains with the
platform until eventually a late reply is received and, as a consequence,
any further transmission attempt remains pending, waiting for the channel
to be relinquished by the platform.

Once that late reply is received the channel ownership is given back
to the agent and any pending request is then allowed to proceed and
overwrite the SMT area of the just delivered late reply; then the wait
for the reply to the new request starts.

It has been observed that the spurious IRQ related to the late reply can
be wrongly associated with the freshly enqueued request: when that happens
the SCMI stack in-flight lookup procedure is fooled by the fact that the
message header now present in the SMT area is related to the new pending
transaction, even though the real reply has still to arrive.

This race-condition on the A2P channel can be detected by looking at the
channel status bits: a genuine reply from the platform will have set the
channel free bit before triggering the completion IRQ.

Add a consistency check to validate such condition in the A2P ISR."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

As is documented in the kdoc comment for nfsd4_release_lockowner(), the
test on so_count can transiently return a false positive resulting in a
return of NFS4ERR_LOCKS_HELD when in fact no locks are held.  This is
clearly a protocol violation and with the Linux NFS client it can cause
incorrect behaviour.

If RELEASE_LOCKOWNER is sent while some other thread is still
processing a LOCK request which failed because, at the time that request
was received, the given owner held a conflicting lock, then the nfsd
thread processing that LOCK request can hold a reference (conflock) to
the lock owner that causes nfsd4_release_lockowner() to return an
incorrect error.

The Linux NFS client ignores that NFS4ERR_LOCKS_HELD error because it
never sends NFS4_RELEASE_LOCKOWNER without first releasing any locks, so
it knows that the error is impossible.  It assumes the lock owner was in
fact released so it feels free to use the same lock owner identifier in
some later locking request.

When it does reuse a lock owner identifier for which a previous RELEASE
failed, it will naturally use a lock_seqid of zero.  However the server,
which didn't release the lock owner, will expect a larger lock_seqid and
so will respond with NFS4ERR_BAD_SEQID.

So clearly it is harmful to allow a false positive, which testing
so_count allows.

The test is nonsense because ... well... it doesn't mean anything.

so_count is the sum of three different counts.
1/ the set of states listed on so_stateids
2/ the set of active vfs locks owned by any of those states
3/ various transient counts such as for conflicting locks.

When it is tested against '2' it is clear that one of these is the
transient reference obtained by find_lockowner_str_locked().  It is not
clear what the other one is expected to be.

In practice, the count is often 2 because there is precisely one state
on so_stateids.  If there were more, this would fail.

In my testing I see two circumstances when RELEASE_LOCKOWNER is called.
In one case, CLOSE is called before RELEASE_LOCKOWNER.  That results in
all the lock states being removed, and so the lockowner being discarded
(it is removed when there are no more references which usually happens
when the lock state is discarded).  When nfsd4_release_lockowner() finds
that the lock owner doesn't exist, it returns success.

The other case shows an so_count of '2' and precisely one state listed
in so_stateid.  It appears that the Linux client uses a separate lock
owner for each file resulting in one lock state per lock owner, so this
test on '2' is safe.  For another client it might not be safe.

So this patch changes check_for_locks() to use the (newish)
find_any_file_locked() so that it doesn't take a reference on the
nfs4_file and so never calls nfsd_file_put(), and so never sleeps.  With
this check is it safe to restore the use of check_for_locks() rather
than testing so_count against the mysterious '2'."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

mm: cachestat: fix folio read-after-free in cache walk

In cachestat, we access the folio from the page cache's xarray to compute
its page offset, and check for its dirty and writeback flags.  However, we
do not hold a reference to the folio before performing these actions,
which means the folio can concurrently be released and reused as another
folio/page/slab.

Get around this altogether by just using xarray's existing machinery for
the folio page offsets and dirty/writeback states.

This changes behavior for tmpfs files to now always report zeroes in their
dirty and writeback counters.  This is okay as tmpfs doesn't follow
conventional writeback cache behavior: its pages get ""cleaned"" during
swapout, after which they're no longer resident etc."	7.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H

YourSpotify version < 1.9.0 does not prevent other pages from displaying it in an iframe and is thus vulnerable to clickjacking. Clickjacking can be used to trick an existing user of YourSpotify to trigger actions, such as allowing signup of other users or deleting the current user account. Clickjacking works by opening the target application in an invisible iframe on an attacker-controlled site and luring a victim to visit the attacker page and interacting with it. By positioning elements over the invisible iframe, a victim can be tricked into triggering malicious or destructive actions in the invisible iframe, while they think they interact with a totally different site altogether. When a victim visits an attacker-controlled site while they are logged into YourSpotify, they can be tricked into performing actions on their YourSpotify instance without their knowledge. These actions include allowing signup of other users or deleting the current user account, resulting in a high impact to the integrity of YourSpotify. This issue has been addressed in version 1.9.0.

An improper validation bug allows users who have `create` privileges but not `override` privileges to sync local manifests on app creation. All other restrictions, including AppProject restrictions are still enforced. The only restriction which is not enforced is that the manifests come from some approved git/Helm/OCI source. The bug was introduced in 1.2.0-rc1 when the local manifest sync feature was added. The bug has been patched in Argo CD versions 2.10.3, 2.9.8, and 2.8.12. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate the risk of branch protection bypass by removing `applications, create` RBAC access.

CVE-2024-28181	2024-03-14T18:15:07.107	2024-11-21T09:05:58.393	 turbo_boost-commands is a set of commands to help you build robust reactive applications with Rails & Hotwire. TurboBoost Commands has existing protections in place to guarantee that only public methods on Command classes can be invoked; however, the existing checks aren't as robust as they should be. It's possible for a sophisticated attacker to invoke more methods than should be permitted depending on the the strictness of authorization checks that individual applications enforce. Being able to call some of these methods can have security implications. Commands verify that the class must be a `Command` and that the method requested is defined as a public method; however, this isn't robust enough to guard against all unwanted code execution. The library should more strictly enforce which methods are considered safe before allowing them to be executed. This issue has been addressed in versions 0.1.3, and 0.2.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should see the repository GHSA for workaround advice.	8.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2024-23944	2024-03-15T11:15:08.927	2025-07-03T15:15:22.713	"Information disclosure in persistent watchers handling in Apache ZooKeeper due to missing ACL check. It allows an attacker to monitor child znodes by attaching a persistent watcher (addWatch command) to a parent which the attacker has already access to. ZooKeeper server doesn't do ACL check when the persistent watcher is triggered and as a consequence, the full path of znodes that a watch event gets triggered upon is exposed to the owner of the watcher. It's important to note that only the path is exposed by this vulnerability, not the data of znode, but since znode path can contain sensitive information like user name or login ID, this issue is potentially critical.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.9.2, 3.8.4 which fixes the issue."	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

If you have a NetFraming based CoreWCF service, extra system resources could be consumed by connections being left established instead of closing or aborting them. There are two scenarios when this can happen. When a client established a connection to the service and sends no data, the service will wait indefinitely for the client to initiate the NetFraming session handshake. Additionally, once a client has established a session, if the client doesn't send any requests for the period of time configured in the binding ReceiveTimeout, the connection is not properly closed as part of the session being aborted. The bindings affected by this behavior are NetTcpBinding, NetNamedPipeBinding, and UnixDomainSocketBinding. Only NetTcpBinding has the ability to accept non local connections. The currently supported versions of CoreWCF are v1.4.x and v1.5.x. The fix can be found in v1.4.2 and v1.5.2 of the CoreWCF packages. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no workarounds for this issue.

Snowflake Hive MetaStore Connector has addressed a potential elevation of privilege vulnerability in a `helper script` for the Hive MetaStore Connector. A malicious insider without admin privileges could, in theory, use the script to download content from a Microsoft domain to the local system and replace the valid content with malicious code. If the attacker then also had local access to the same system where the maliciously modified script is run, they could attempt to manipulate users into executing the attacker-controlled helper script, potentially gaining elevated privileges to the local system. The vulnerability in the script was patched on February 09, 2024, without a version bump to the Connector. User who use the helper script are strongly advised to use the latest version as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade should avoid using the helper script.	4.0	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

The `JwtFilter` handles the API authentication by requiring and verifying JWT tokens. When a new request comes in, the request's path is checked against this list. When the request's path contains any of the excluded endpoints the filter returns without validating the JWT. Unfortunately, an attacker may use Path Parameters to make any path contain any arbitrary strings. For example, a request to `GET /api/v1;v1%2fusers%2flogin/events/subscriptions/validation/condition/111` will match the excluded endpoint condition and therefore will be processed with no JWT validation allowing an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and reach any arbitrary endpoint, including the ones listed above that lead to arbitrary SpEL expression injection.

`cad_pid`, we decrement a reference we never incremented, can therefore
free the init task's struct pid early.  As there can be dangling
references to the struct pid, we can later encounter a use-after-free
(e.g.  when delivering signals).

This was spotted when fuzzing v5.13-rc3 with Syzkaller, but seems to
have been around since the conversion of `cad_pid` to struct pid in
commit 9ec52099e4b8 (""[PATCH] replace cad_pid by a struct pid"") from the
pre-KASAN stone age of v2.6.19.

Fix this by getting a reference to the init task's struct pid when we
assign it to `cad_pid`.

ext4: fix memory leak in ext4_fill_super

Buffer head references must be released before calling kill_bdev();
otherwise the buffer head (and its page referenced by b_data) will not
be freed by kill_bdev, and subsequently that bh will be leaked.

If blocksizes differ, sb_set_blocksize() will kill current buffers and
page cache by using kill_bdev(). And then super block will be reread
again but using correct blocksize this time. sb_set_blocksize() didn't
fully free superblock page and buffer head, and being busy, they were
not freed and instead leaked.

This can easily be reproduced by calling an infinite loop of:

  systemctl start <ext4_on_lvm>.mount, and
  systemctl stop <ext4_on_lvm>.mount

... since systemd creates a cgroup for each slice which it mounts, and
the bh leak get amplified by a dying memory cgroup that also never

The commit ae81feb7338c (""sch_htb: fix null pointer dereference

is not correct.

Because htb_graft_helper properly handles the case when new_q
is NULL, and after the previous patch by skipping this call
which creates an inconsistency : dev_queue->qdisc will still
point to the old qdisc, but cl->parent->leaf.q will point to
the new one (which will be noop_qdisc, because new_q was NULL).
The code is based on an assumption that these two pointers are
the same, so it can lead to refcount leaks.

qdisc_refcount_inc inside htb_parent_to_leaf_offload."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

ice: track AF_XDP ZC enabled queues in bitmap

Commit c7a219048e45 (""ice: Remove xsk_buff_pool from VSI structure"")
silently introduced a regression and broke the Tx side of AF_XDP in copy
mode. xsk_pool on ice_ring is set only based on the existence of the XDP
prog on the VSI which in turn picks ice_clean_tx_irq_zc to be executed.
That is not something that should happen for copy mode as it should use
the regular data path ice_clean_tx_irq.

This results in a following splat when xdpsock is run in txonly or l2fwd
scenarios in copy mode:

CVE-2021-47128	2024-03-15T21:15:07.470	2025-03-13T21:24:38.587	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf, lockdown, audit: Fix buggy SELinux lockdown permission checks

Commit 59438b46471a (""security,lockdown,selinux: implement SELinux lockdown"")
added an implementation of the locked_down LSM hook to SELinux, with the aim
to restrict which domains are allowed to perform operations that would breach
lockdown. This is indirectly also getting audit subsystem involved to report
events. The latter is problematic, as reported by Ondrej and Serhei, since it
can bring down the whole system via audit:

  1) The audit events that are triggered due to calls to security_locked_down()
     can OOM kill a machine, see below details [0].

  2) It also seems to be causing a deadlock via avc_has_perm()/slow_avc_audit()
     when trying to wake up kauditd, for example, when using trace_sched_switch()
     tracepoint, see details in [1]. Triggering this was not via some hypothetical
     corner case, but with existing tools like runqlat & runqslower from bcc, for
     example, which make use of this tracepoint. Rough call sequence goes like:

     rq_lock(rq) -> -------------------------+
       trace_sched_switch() ->               |
         bpf_prog_xyz() ->                   +-> deadlock
           selinux_lockdown() ->             |
             audit_log_end() ->              |
               wake_up_interruptible() ->    |
                 try_to_wake_up() ->         |
                   rq_lock(rq) --------------+

What's worse is that the intention of 59438b46471a to further restrict lockdown
settings for specific applications in respect to the global lockdown policy is
completely broken for BPF. The SELinux policy rule for the current lockdown check
looks something like this:

  allow <who> <who> : lockdown { <reason> };

However, this doesn't match with the 'current' task where the security_locked_down()
is executed, example: httpd does a syscall. There is a tracing program attached
to the syscall which triggers a BPF program to run, which ends up doing a
bpf_probe_read_kernel{,_str}() helper call. The selinux_lockdown() hook does
the permission check against 'current', that is, httpd in this example. httpd
has literally zero relation to this tracing program, and it would be nonsensical
having to write an SELinux policy rule against httpd to let the tracing helper
pass. The policy in this case needs to be against the entity that is installing
the BPF program. For example, if bpftrace would generate a histogram of syscall
counts by user space application:

  bpftrace -e 'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

bpftrace would then go and generate a BPF program from this internally. One way
of doing it [for the sake of the example] could be to call bpf_get_current_task()
helper and then access current->comm via one of bpf_probe_read_kernel{,_str}()
helpers. So the program itself has nothing to do with httpd or any other random
app doing a syscall here. The BPF program _explicitly initiated_ the lockdown
check. The allow/deny policy belongs in the context of bpftrace: meaning, you
want to grant bpftrace access to use these helpers, but other tracers on the
system like my_random_tracer _not_.

Therefore fix all three issues at the same time by taking a completely different
approach for the security_locked_down() hook, that is, move the check into the
program verification phase where we actually retrieve the BPF func proto. This
also reliably gets the task (current) that is trying to install the BPF tracing
program, e.g. bpftrace/bcc/perf/systemtap/etc, and it also fixes the OOM since
we're moving this out of the BPF helper's fast-path which can be called several
millions of times per second.

The check is then also in line with other security_locked_down() hooks in the
system where the enforcement is performed at open/load time, for example,
open_kcore() for /proc/kcore access or module_sig_check() for module signatures
just to pick f

net/tls: Fix use-after-free after the TLS device goes down and up

When a netdev with active TLS offload goes down, tls_device_down is
called to stop the offload and tear down the TLS context. However, the
socket stays alive, and it still points to the TLS context, which is now
deallocated. If a netdev goes up, while the connection is still active,
and the data flow resumes after a number of TCP retransmissions, it will
lead to a use-after-free of the TLS context.

This commit addresses this bug by keeping the context alive until its
normal destruction, and implements the necessary fallbacks, so that the
connection can resume in software (non-offloaded) kTLS mode.

On the TX side tls_sw_fallback is used to encrypt all packets. The RX
side already has all the necessary fallbacks, because receiving
non-decrypted packets is supported. The thing needed on the RX side is
to block resync requests, which are normally produced after receiving
non-decrypted packets.

The necessary synchronization is implemented for a graceful teardown:
first the fallbacks are deployed, then the driver resources are released
(it used to be possible to have a tls_dev_resync after tls_dev_del).

A new flag called TLS_RX_DEV_DEGRADED is added to indicate the fallback
mode. It's used to skip the RX resync logic completely, as it becomes
useless, and some objects may be released (for example, resync_async,
which is allocated and freed by the driver)."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Symfony 1 has a gadget chain due to vulnerable Swift Mailer dependency that would enable an attacker to get remote code execution if a developer unserialize user input in his project. This vulnerability present no direct threat but is a vector that will enable remote code execution if a developper deserialize user untrusted data. Symfony 1 depends on Swift Mailer which is bundled by default in vendor directory in the default installation since 1.3.0. Swift Mailer classes implement some `__destruct()` methods. These methods are called when php destroys the object in memory. However, it is possible to include any object type in `$this->_keys` to make PHP access to another array/object properties than intended by the developer. In particular, it is possible to abuse the array access which is triggered on foreach($this->_keys ...) for any class implementing ArrayAccess interface. This may allow an attacker to execute any PHP command which leads to remote code execution. This issue has been addressed in version 1.5.18. Users are advised to upgrade.

CVE-2023-52609	2024-03-18T11:15:07.743	2025-03-10T15:28:37.830	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

binder: fix race between mmput() and do_exit()

Task A calls binder_update_page_range() to allocate and insert pages on
a remote address space from Task B. For this, Task A pins the remote mm
via mmget_not_zero() first. This can race with Task B do_exit() and the
final mmput() refcount decrement will come from Task A.

  Task A            | Task B
  ------------------+------------------
  mmget_not_zero()  |
                    |  do_exit()
                    |    exit_mm()
                    |      mmput()
  mmput()           |
    exit_mmap()     |
      remove_vma()  |
        fput()      |

In this case, the work of ____fput() from Task B is queued up in Task A
as TWA_RESUME. So in theory, Task A returns to userspace and the cleanup
work gets executed. However, Task A instead sleep, waiting for a reply
from Task B that never comes (it's dead).

This means the binder_deferred_release() is blocked until an unrelated
binder event forces Task A to go back to userspace. All the associated
death notifications will also be delayed until then.

In order to fix this use mmput_async() that will schedule the work in
the corresponding mm->async_put_work WQ instead of Task A."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2023-52610	2024-03-18T11:15:07.943	2025-03-10T15:39:09.893	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: act_ct: fix skb leak and crash on ooo frags

act_ct adds skb->users before defragmentation. If frags arrive in order,
the last frag's reference is reset in:

  inet_frag_reasm_prepare
    skb_morph

which is not straightforward.

However when frags arrive out of order, nobody unref the last frag, and
all frags are leaked. The situation is even worse, as initiating packet
capture can lead to a crash[0] when skb has been cloned and shared at the
same time.

Fix the issue by removing skb_get() before defragmentation. act_ct
returns TC_ACT_CONSUMED when defrag failed or in progress.

CVE-2023-52611	2024-03-18T11:15:08.157	2025-03-10T15:54:04.750	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: rtw88: sdio: Honor the host max_req_size in the RX path

Lukas reports skb_over_panic errors on his Banana Pi BPI-CM4 which comes
with an Amlogic A311D (G12B) SoC and a RTL8822CS SDIO wifi/Bluetooth
combo card. The error he observed is identical to what has been fixed
in commit e967229ead0e (""wifi: rtw88: sdio: Check the HISR RX_REQUEST
bit in rtw_sdio_rx_isr()"") but that commit didn't fix Lukas' problem.

Lukas found that disabling or limiting RX aggregation works around the
problem for some time (but does not fully fix it). In the following
discussion a few key topics have been discussed which have an impact on
this problem:
- The Amlogic A311D (G12B) SoC has a hardware bug in the SDIO controller
  which prevents DMA transfers. Instead all transfers need to go through
  the controller SRAM which limits transfers to 1536 bytes
- rtw88 chips don't split incoming (RX) packets, so if a big packet is
  received this is forwarded to the host in it's original form
- rtw88 chips can do RX aggregation, meaning more multiple incoming
  packets can be pulled by the host from the card with one MMC/SDIO
  transfer. This Depends on settings in the REG_RXDMA_AGG_PG_TH
  register (BIT_RXDMA_AGG_PG_TH limits the number of packets that will
  be aggregated, BIT_DMA_AGG_TO_V1 configures a timeout for aggregation
  and BIT_EN_PRE_CALC makes the chip honor the limits more effectively)

Use multiple consecutive reads in rtw_sdio_read_port() and limit the
number of bytes which are copied by the host from the card in one
MMC/SDIO transfer. This allows receiving a buffer that's larger than
the hosts max_req_size (number of bytes which can be transferred in
one MMC/SDIO transfer). As a result of this the skb_over_panic error
is gone as the rtw88 driver is now able to receive more than 1536 bytes
from the card (either because the incoming packet is larger than that
or because multiple packets have been aggregated).

In case of an receive errors (-EILSEQ has been observed by Lukas) we
need to drain the remaining data from the card's buffer, otherwise the
card will return corrupt data for the next rtw_sdio_read_port() call."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

PCI: switchtec: Fix stdev_release() crash after surprise hot remove

A PCI device hot removal may occur while stdev->cdev is held open. The call
to stdev_release() then happens during close or exit, at a point way past
switchtec_pci_remove(). Otherwise the last ref would vanish with the
trailing put_device(), just before return.

At that later point in time, the devm cleanup has already removed the
stdev->mmio_mrpc mapping. Also, the stdev->pdev reference was not a counted
one. Therefore, in DMA mode, the iowrite32() in stdev_release() will cause
a fatal page fault, and the subsequent dma_free_coherent(), if reached,
would pass a stale &stdev->pdev->dev pointer.

Fix by moving MRPC DMA shutdown into switchtec_pci_remove(), after
stdev_kill(). Counting the stdev->pdev ref is now optional, but may prevent
future accidents.

llc: Drop support for ETH_P_TR_802_2.

syzbot reported an uninit-value bug below. [0]

llc supports ETH_P_802_2 (0x0004) and used to support ETH_P_TR_802_2
(0x0011), and syzbot abused the latter to trigger the bug.

  write$tun(r0, &(0x7f0000000040)={@val={0x0, 0x11}, @val, @mpls={[], @llc={@snap={0xaa, 0x1, ')', ""90e5dd""}}}}, 0x16)

llc_conn_handler() initialises local variables {saddr,daddr}.mac
based on skb in llc_pdu_decode_sa()/llc_pdu_decode_da() and passes
them to __llc_lookup().

However, the initialisation is done only when skb->protocol is
htons(ETH_P_802_2), otherwise, __llc_lookup_established() and
__llc_lookup_listener() will read garbage.

The missing initialisation existed prior to commit 211ed865108e
(""net: delete all instances of special processing for token ring"").

It removed the part to kick out the token ring stuff but forgot to
close the door allowing ETH_P_TR_802_2 packets to sneak into llc_rcv().

Let's remove llc_tr_packet_type and complete the deprecation.

llc: make llc_ui_sendmsg() more robust against bonding changes

syzbot was able to trick llc_ui_sendmsg(), allocating an skb with no
headroom, but subsequently trying to push 14 bytes of Ethernet header [1]

Like some others, llc_ui_sendmsg() releases the socket lock before
calling sock_alloc_send_skb().
Then it acquires it again, but does not redo all the sanity checks
that were performed.

This fix:

- Uses LL_RESERVED_SPACE() to reserve space.
- Check all conditions again after socket lock is held again.
- Do not account Ethernet header for mtu limitation.

tcp: add sanity checks to rx zerocopy

TCP rx zerocopy intent is to map pages initially allocated
from NIC drivers, not pages owned by a fs.

This patch adds to can_map_frag() these additional checks:

- Page must not be a compound one.
- page->mapping must be NULL.

This fixes the panic reported by ZhangPeng.

syzbot was able to loopback packets built with sendfile(),
mapping pages owned by an ext4 file to TCP rx zerocopy.

CVE-2024-21661	2024-03-18T19:15:06.687	2025-01-09T17:09:38.313	Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Prior to versions 2.8.13, 2.9.9, and 2.10.4, an attacker can exploit a critical flaw in the application to initiate a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, rendering the application inoperable and affecting all users. The issue arises from unsafe manipulation of an array in a multi-threaded environment. The vulnerability is rooted in the application's code, where an array is being modified while it is being iterated over. This is a classic programming error but becomes critically unsafe when executed in a multi-threaded environment. When two threads interact with the same array simultaneously, the application crashes. This is a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability. Any attacker can crash the application continuously, making it impossible for legitimate users to access the service. The issue is exacerbated because it does not require authentication, widening the pool of potential attackers. Versions 2.8.13, 2.9.9, and 2.10.4 contain a patch for this issue.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2024-21662	2024-03-18T19:15:06.870	2025-01-09T17:13:17.787	Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Prior to versions 2.8.13, 2.9.9, and 2.10.4, an attacker can effectively bypass the rate limit and brute force protections by exploiting the application's weak cache-based mechanism. This loophole in security can be combined with other vulnerabilities to attack the default admin account. This flaw undermines a patch for CVE-2020-8827 intended to protect against brute-force attacks. The application's brute force protection relies on a cache mechanism that tracks login attempts for each user. This cache is limited to a `defaultMaxCacheSize` of 1000 entries. An attacker can overflow this cache by bombarding it with login attempts for different users, thereby pushing out the admin account's failed attempts and effectively resetting the rate limit for that account. This is a severe vulnerability that enables attackers to perform brute force attacks at an accelerated rate, especially targeting the default admin account. Users should upgrade to version 2.8.13, 2.9.9, or 2.10.4 to receive a patch.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

CVE-2024-22412	2024-03-18T21:15:06.230	2024-11-21T08:56:14.090	ClickHouse is an open-source column-oriented database management system. A bug exists in the cloud ClickHouse offering prior to version 24.0.2.54535 and in github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse version 23.1. Query caching bypasses the role based access controls and the policies being enforced on roles. In affected versions, the query cache only respects separate users, however this is not documented and not expected behavior. People relying on ClickHouse roles can have their access control lists bypassed if they are using query caching. Attackers who have control of a role could guess queries and see data they shouldn't have access to. Version 24.1 of ClickHouse and version 24.0.2.54535 of ClickHouse Cloud contain a patch for this issue. Based on the documentation, role based access control should be enforced regardless if query caching is enabled or not.	2.4	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

LAM's log configuration allows to specify arbitrary paths for log files. Prior to version 8.7, an attacker could exploit this by creating a PHP file and cause LAM to log some PHP code to this file. When the file is then accessed via web the code would be executed. The issue is mitigated by the following: An attacker needs to know LAM's master configuration password to be able to change the main settings; and the webserver needs write access to a directory that is accessible via web. LAM itself does not provide any such directories. The issue has been fixed in 8.7. As a workaround, limit access to LAM configuration pages to authorized users.

CVE-2024-28864	2024-03-18T22:15:09.247	2024-11-21T09:07:04.173	SecureProps is a PHP library designed to simplify the encryption and decryption of property data in objects. A vulnerability in SecureProps version 1.2.0 and 1.2.1 involves a regex failing to detect tags during decryption of encrypted data. This occurs when the encrypted data has been encoded with `NullEncoder` and passed to `TagAwareCipher`, and contains special characters such as `\n`. As a result, the decryption process is skipped since the tags are not detected. This causes the encrypted data to be returned in plain format.  The vulnerability affects users who implement `TagAwareCipher` with any base cipher that has `NullEncoder` (not default). The patch for the issue has been released. Users are advised to update to version 1.2.2. As a workaround, one may use the default `Base64Encoder` with the base cipher decorated with `TagAwareCipher` to prevent special characters in the encrypted string from interfering with regex tag detection logic.  This workaround is safe but may involve double encoding since `TagAwareCipher` uses `NullEncoder` by default.	2.6	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

invoking of a stub.  Such a replayed instruction may raise an

A path traversal vulnerability in versions 2.23.4 and prior requires GeoServer Administrator with access to the admin console to misconfigure the Global Settings for log file location to an arbitrary location. The admin console GeoServer Logs page provides a preview of these contents. As this issue requires GeoServer administrators access, often representing a trusted party, the vulnerability has not received a patch as of time of publication. As a workaround, a system administrator responsible for running GeoServer can use the `GEOSERVER_LOG_FILE` setting to override any configuration option provided by the Global Settings page. The `GEOSERVER_LOG_LOCATION` parameter can be set as system property, environment variables, or servlet context parameters.	7.2	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

This vulnerability can lead to executing arbitrary code.

A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in versions prior to 2.23.3 and 2.24.0 that enables an authenticated administrator with workspace-level privileges to store a JavaScript payload in uploaded style/legend resources that will execute in the context of another administrator's browser when viewed in the REST Resources API.  Access to the REST Resources API is limited to full administrators by default and granting non-administrators access to this endpoint should be carefully considered as it may allow access to files containing sensitive information.

CVE-2024-23634	2024-03-20T16:15:07.857	2024-12-17T20:20:50.693	GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. An arbitrary file renaming vulnerability exists in versions prior to 2.23.5 and 2.24.2 that enables an authenticated administrator with permissions to modify stores through the REST Coverage Store or Data Store API to rename arbitrary files and directories with a name that does not end in `.zip`. Store file uploads rename zip files to have a `.zip` extension if it doesn't already have one before unzipping the file.  This is fine for file and url upload methods where the files will be in a specific subdirectory of the data directory but, when using the external upload method, this allows arbitrary files and directories to be renamed. Renaming GeoServer files will most likely result in a denial of service, either completely preventing GeoServer from running or effectively deleting specific resources (such as a workspace, layer or style).  In some cases, renaming GeoServer files could revert to the default settings for that file which could be relatively harmless like removing contact information or have more serious consequences like allowing users to make OGC requests that the customized settings would have prevented them from making. The impact of renaming non-GeoServer files depends on the specific environment although some sort of denial of service is a likely outcome. Versions 2.23.5 and 2.24.2 contain a fix for this issue.	6.0	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H

When a user moves a Zulip message, they have the option to move all messages in the topic, move only subsequent messages as well, or move just a single message.  If the user chose to just move one message, and was moving it from a public stream to a private stream, Zulip would successfully move the message, -- but active users who did not have access to the private stream, but whose client had already received the message, would continue to see the message in the public stream until they reloaded their client.  Additionally, Zulip did not remove view permissions on the message from recently-active users, allowing the message to show up in the ""All messages"" view or in search results, but not in ""Inbox"" or ""Recent conversations"" views. While the bug has been present since moving messages between streams was first introduced in version 3.0, this option became much more common starting in Zulip 8.0, when the default option in the picker for moving the very last message in a conversation was changed.

CVE-2024-29018	2024-03-20T21:15:31.113	2025-04-09T15:40:20.030	"Moby is an open source container framework that is a key component of Docker Engine, Docker Desktop, and other distributions of container tooling or runtimes. Moby's networking implementation allows for many networks, each with their own IP address range and gateway, to be defined. This feature is frequently referred to as custom networks, as each network can have a different driver, set of parameters and thus behaviors. When creating a network, the `--internal` flag is used to designate a network as _internal_. The `internal` attribute in a docker-compose.yml file may also be used to mark a network _internal_, and other API clients may specify the `internal` parameter as well.

When containers with networking are created, they are assigned unique network interfaces and IP addresses. The host serves as a router for non-internal networks, with a gateway IP that provides SNAT/DNAT to/from container IPs.

Containers on an internal network may communicate between each other, but are precluded from communicating with any networks the host has access to (LAN or WAN) as no default route is configured, and firewall rules are set up to drop all outgoing traffic. Communication with the gateway IP address (and thus appropriately configured host services) is possible, and the host may communicate with any container IP directly.

In addition to configuring the Linux kernel's various networking features to enable container networking, `dockerd` directly provides some services to container networks. Principal among these is serving as a resolver, enabling service discovery, and resolution of names from an upstream resolver.

When a DNS request for a name that does not correspond to a container is received, the request is forwarded to the configured upstream resolver. This request is made from the container's network namespace: the level of access and routing of traffic is the same as if the request was made by the container itself.

As a consequence of this design, containers solely attached to an internal network will be unable to resolve names using the upstream resolver, as the container itself is unable to communicate with that nameserver. Only the names of containers also attached to the internal network are able to be resolved.

Many systems run a local forwarding DNS resolver. As the host and any containers have separate loopback devices, a consequence of the design described above is that containers are unable to resolve names from the host's configured resolver, as they cannot reach these addresses on the host loopback device. To bridge this gap, and to allow containers to properly resolve names even when a local forwarding resolver is used on a loopback address, `dockerd` detects this scenario and instead forward DNS requests from the host namework namespace. The loopback resolver then forwards the requests to its configured upstream resolvers, as expected.

Because `dockerd` forwards DNS requests to the host loopback device, bypassing the container network namespace's normal routing semantics entirely, internal networks can unexpectedly forward DNS requests to an external nameserver. By registering a domain for which they control the authoritative nameservers, an attacker could arrange for a compromised container to exfiltrate data by encoding it in DNS queries that will eventually be answered by their nameservers.

Docker Desktop is not affected, as Docker Desktop always runs an internal resolver on a RFC 1918 address.

Moby releases 26.0.0, 25.0.4, and 23.0.11 are patched to prevent forwarding any DNS requests from internal networks. As a workaround, run containers intended to be solely attached to internal networks with a custom upstream address, which will force all upstream DNS queries to be resolved from the container's network namespace."	5.9	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

Starting in version 0.1.143 and prior to version 0.2.182, due to configuration issues in the helm chart, if there was a successful initial deployment during a limited window of time, personal access tokens were possibly created with a default secret key. Since the secret key is a static, publicly available value, someone could inspect the algorithm used to generate personal access tokens and generate their own for an instance. Deploying with Metadata Service Authentication enabled would have been difficult during window of releases. If someone circumvented the helm settings and manually set Metadata Service Authentication to be enabled using environment variables directly, this would skip over the autogeneration logic for the Kubernetes Secrets and DataHub GMS would default to the signing key specified statically in the application.yml. Most deployments probably did not attempt to circumvent the helm settings to enable Metadata Service Authentication during this time, so impact is most likely limited. Any deployments with Metadata Service Authentication enabled should ensure that their secret values are properly randomized. Version 0.2.182 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, one may reset the token signing key to be a random value, which will invalidate active personal access tokens.	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

Prior to versions 2.6.1, 2.7.3, and 2.8.4, a vulnerability in Coder's OIDC authentication could allow an attacker to bypass the `CODER_OIDC_EMAIL_DOMAIN` verification and create an account with an email not in the allowlist. Deployments are only affected if the OIDC provider allows users to create accounts on the provider. During OIDC registration, the user's email was improperly validated against the allowed `CODER_OIDC_EMAIL_DOMAIN`s. This could allow a user with a domain that only partially matched an allowed domain to successfully login or register. An attacker could register a domain name that exploited this vulnerability and register on a Coder instance with a public OIDC provider.

Coder instances with OIDC enabled and protected by the `CODER_OIDC_EMAIL_DOMAIN` configuration are affected. Coder instances using a private OIDC provider are not affected, as arbitrary users cannot register through a private OIDC provider without first having an account on the provider. Public OIDC providers are impacted. GitHub authentication and external authentication are not impacted. This vulnerability is remedied in versions 2.8.4, 2.7.3, and 2.6.1 All versions prior to these patches are affected by the vulnerability.*It is recommended that customers upgrade their deployments as soon as possible if they are utilizing OIDC authentication with the `CODER_OIDC_EMAIL_DOMAIN` setting."	8.2	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H

In version 1.39.0, use of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leads to premature close of arbitrary file descriptors, allowing standard input to be re-opened as a different resource resulting in permission prompt bypass. Node child_process IPC relies on the JS side to pass the raw IPC file descriptor to `op_node_ipc_pipe()`, which returns a `IpcJsonStreamResource` ID associated with the file descriptor. On closing the resource, the raw file descriptor is closed together.

Use of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leads to premature close of arbitrary file descriptors. This allow standard input (fd 0) to be closed and re-opened for a different resource, which allows a silent permission prompt bypass. This is exploitable by an attacker controlling the code executed inside a Deno runtime to obtain arbitrary code execution on the host machine regardless of permissions.

This bug is known to be exploitable. There is a working exploit that achieves arbitrary code execution by bypassing prompts from zero permissions, additionally abusing the fact that Cache API lacks filesystem permission checks. The attack can be conducted silently as stderr can also be closed, suppressing all prompt outputs.

Version 1.39.1 fixes the bug.

Starting in version 1.35.1 and prior to version 1.36.3, a vulnerability in Deno's Node.js compatibility runtime allows for cross-session data contamination during simultaneous asynchronous reads from Node.js streams sourced from sockets or files. The issue arises from the re-use of a global buffer (BUF) in stream_wrap.ts used as a performance optimization to limit allocations during these asynchronous read operations. This can lead to data intended for one session being received by another session, potentially resulting in data corruption and unexpected behavior. This affects all users of Deno that use the node.js compatibility layer for network communication or other streams, including packages that may require node.js libraries indirectly.

Starting in version 1.32.1 and prior to version 1.41.0 of the deno library, maliciously crafted permission request can show the spoofed permission prompt by inserting a broken ANSI escape sequence into the request contents. Deno is stripping any ANSI escape sequences from the permission prompt, but permissions given to the program are based on the contents that contain the ANSI escape sequences. Any Deno program can spoof the content of the interactive permission prompt by inserting a broken ANSI code, which allows a malicious Deno program to display the wrong file path or program name to the user.

with a pipapo set with low timeouts which is not possible upstream since

Fix this by setting on the dead flag for anonymous sets to skip async gc
in this case.

According to 08e4c8c5919f (""netfilter: nf_tables: mark newset as dead on

It is possible to access any file on the developer's machine. The middleware can either work with the physical filesystem when reading the files or it can use a virtualized in-memory `memfs` filesystem. If `writeToDisk` configuration option is set to `true`, the physical filesystem is used. The `getFilenameFromUrl` method is used to parse URL and build the local file path. The public path prefix is stripped from the URL, and the `unsecaped` path suffix is appended to the `outputPath`. As the URL is not unescaped and normalized automatically before calling the midlleware, it is possible to use `%2e` and `%2f` sequences to perform path traversal attack.

Developers using `webpack-dev-server` or `webpack-dev-middleware` are affected by the issue. When the project is started, an attacker might access any file on the developer's machine and exfiltrate the content. If the development server is listening on a public IP address (or `0.0.0.0`), an attacker on the local network can access the local files without any interaction from the victim (direct connection to the port). If the server allows access from third-party domains, an attacker can send a malicious link to the victim. When visited, the client side script can connect to the local server and exfiltrate the local files. Starting with fixed versions 7.1.0, 6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the URL is unescaped and normalized before any further processing."	7.4	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVE-2024-29184	2024-03-22T17:15:08.203	2025-01-10T15:06:59.540	"FreeScout is a self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified within the Signature Input Field of the FreeScout Application prior to version 1.8.128. Stored XSS occurs when user input is not properly sanitized and is stored on the server, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed when other users access the affected page. In this case, the Support Agent User can inject malicious scripts into their signature, which will then be executed when viewed by the Administrator.

The application protects users against XSS attacks by enforcing a CSP policy, the CSP Policy is:  `script-src 'self' 'nonce-abcd'  `. The CSP policy only allows the inclusion of JS files that are present on the application server and doesn't allow any inline script or script other than nonce-abcd. The CSP policy was bypassed by uploading a JS file to the server by a POST request to /conversation/upload endpoint. After this, a working XSS payload was crafted by including the uploaded JS file link as the src of the script. This bypassed the CSP policy and XSS attacks became possible.

The impact of this vulnerability is severe as it allows an attacker to compromise the FreeScout Application. By exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker can perform various malicious actions such as forcing the Administrator to execute actions without their knowledge or consent. For instance, the attacker can force the Administrator to add a new administrator controlled by the attacker, thereby giving the attacker full control over the application. Alternatively, the attacker can elevate the privileges of a low-privileged user to Administrator, further compromising the security of the application. Attackers can steal sensitive information such as login credentials, session tokens, personal identifiable information (PII), and financial data. The vulnerability can also lead to defacement of the Application.

CVE-2024-29185	2024-03-22T17:15:08.440	2025-01-10T15:03:50.393	FreeScout is a self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Versions prior to 1.8.128 are vulnerable to OS Command Injection in the /public/tools.php source file. The value of the php_path parameter is being executed as an OS command by the shell_exec function, without validating it. This allows an adversary to execute malicious OS commands on the server. A practical demonstration of the successful command injection attack extracted the /etc/passwd file of the server. This represented the complete compromise of the server hosting the FreeScout application. This attack requires an attacker to know the `App_Key` of the application. This limitation makes the Attack Complexity to be High. If an attacker gets hold of the `App_Key`, the attacker can compromise the Complete server on which the application is deployed.

CVE-2024-29186	2024-03-22T17:15:08.640	2024-11-21T09:07:45.250	"Bref is an open-source project that helps users go serverless on Amazon Web Services with PHP. When Bref prior to version 2.1.17 is used with the Event-Driven Function runtime and the handler is a `RequestHandlerInterface`, then the Lambda event is converted to a PSR7 object. During the conversion process, if the request is a MultiPart, each part is parsed. In the parsing process, the `Content-Type` header of each part is read using the `Riverline/multipart-parser` library.

The library, in the `StreamedPart::parseHeaderContent` function, performs slow multi-byte string operations on the header value.
Precisely, the `mb_convert_encoding` function is used with the first (`$string`) and third (`$from_encoding`) parameters read from the header value.

An attacker could send specifically crafted requests which would force the server into performing long operations with a consequent long billed duration.

The attack has the following requirements and limitations: The Lambda should use the Event-Driven Function runtime and the `RequestHandlerInterface` handler and should implement at least an endpoint accepting POST requests; the attacker can send requests up to 6MB long (this is enough to cause a billed duration between 400ms and 500ms with the default 1024MB RAM Lambda image of Bref); and if the Lambda uses a PHP runtime <= php-82, the impact is higher as the billed duration in the default 1024MB RAM Lambda image of Bref could be brought to more than 900ms for each request. Notice that the vulnerability applies only to headers read from the request body as the request header has a limitation which allows a total maximum size of ~10KB.

CVE-2024-29188	2024-03-24T20:15:08.243	2024-11-21T09:07:45.513	WiX toolset lets developers create installers for Windows Installer, the Windows installation engine. The custom action behind WiX's `RemoveFolderEx` functionality could allow a standard user to delete protected directories. `RemoveFolderEx` deletes an entire directory tree during installation or uninstallation. It does so by recursing every subdirectory starting at a specified directory and adding each subdirectory to the list of directories Windows Installer should delete. If the setup author instructed `RemoveFolderEx` to delete a per-user folder from a per-machine installer, an attacker could create a directory junction in that per-user folder pointing to a per-machine, protected directory. Windows Installer, when executing the per-machine installer after approval by an administrator, would delete the target of the directory junction. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.14.1 and 4.0.5.	7.9	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H

net: zero-initialize tc skb extension on allocation

Function skb_ext_add() doesn't initialize created skb extension with any
value and leaves it up to the user. However, since extension of type
TC_SKB_EXT originally contained only single value tc_skb_ext->chain its
users used to just assign the chain value without setting whole extension
memory to zero first. This assumption changed when TC_SKB_EXT extension was
extended with additional fields but not all users were updated to
initialize the new fields which leads to use of uninitialized memory
afterwards. UBSAN log:

Now that the i2c-i801 driver supports interrupts, setting the KILL bit

appended frag skb are seen by multiple skbs but it only got skb_get

USB: usbfs: Don't WARN about excessively large memory allocations

Syzbot found that the kernel generates a WARNing if the user tries to
submit a bulk transfer through usbfs with a buffer that is way too
large.  This isn't a bug in the kernel; it's merely an invalid request
from the user and the usbfs code does handle it correctly.

In theory the same thing can happen with async transfers, or with the
packet descriptor table for isochronous transfers.

To prevent the MM subsystem from complaining about these bad
allocation requests, add the __GFP_NOWARN flag to the kmalloc calls
for these buffers."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

iio: adc: ad7124: Fix potential overflow due to non sequential channel numbers

Channel numbering must start at 0 and then not have any holes, or
it is possible to overflow the available storage.  Note this bug was
introduced as part of a fix to ensure we didn't rely on the ordering
of child nodes.  So we need to support arbitrary ordering but they all
need to be there somewhere.

Note I hit this when using qemu to test the rest of this series.
Arguably this isn't the best fix, but it is probably the most minimal
option for backporting etc.

scsi: target: core: Avoid smp_processor_id() in preemptible code

The BUG message ""BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000]
code"" was observed for TCMU devices with kernel config DEBUG_PREEMPT.

The message was observed when blktests block/005 was run on TCMU devices
with fileio backend or user:zbc backend [1]. The commit 1130b499b4a7
(""scsi: target: tcm_loop: Use LIO wq cmd submission helper"") triggered the
symptom. The commit modified work queue to handle commands and changed
'current->nr_cpu_allowed' at smp_processor_id() call.

The message was also observed at system shutdown when TCMU devices were not
cleaned up [2]. The function smp_processor_id() was called in SCSI host
work queue for abort handling, and triggered the BUG message. This symptom
was observed regardless of the commit 1130b499b4a7 (""scsi: target:
tcm_loop: Use LIO wq cmd submission helper"").

To avoid the preemptible code check at smp_processor_id(), get CPU ID with
raw_smp_processor_id() instead. The CPU ID is used for performance
improvement then thread move to other CPU will not affect the code.

WP Crontrol includes a feature that allows administrative users to create events in the WP-Cron system that store and execute PHP code subject to the restrictive security permissions documented here. While there is no known vulnerability in this feature on its own, there exists potential for this feature to be vulnerable to RCE if it were specifically targeted via vulnerability chaining that exploited a separate SQLi (or similar) vulnerability. This is exploitable on a site if one of the below preconditions are met, the site is vulnerable to a writeable SQLi vulnerability in any plugin, theme, or WordPress core, the site's database is compromised at the hosting level, the site is vulnerable to a method of updating arbitrary options in the wp_options table, or the site is vulnerable to a method of triggering an arbitrary action, filter, or function with control of the parameters.  As a hardening measure, WP Crontrol version 1.16.2 ships with a new feature that prevents tampering of the code stored in a PHP cron event.	8.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

KaTeX users who render untrusted mathematical expressions could encounter malicious input using `\def` or `\newcommand` that causes a near-infinite loop, despite setting `maxExpand` to avoid such loops. KaTeX supports an option named maxExpand which aims to prevent infinitely recursive macros from consuming all available memory and/or triggering a stack overflow error. Unfortunately, support for ""Unicode (sub|super)script characters"" allows an attacker to bypass this limit.

Versions of Express.js prior to 4.19.0 and all pre-release alpha and beta versions of 5.0 are affected by an open redirect vulnerability using malformed URLs. When a user of Express performs a redirect using a user-provided URL Express performs an encode [using `encodeurl`](https://github.com/pillarjs/encodeurl) on the contents before passing it to the `location` header. This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list. The main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`.

This vulnerability is fixed in 11.2.2 and 11.1.6.1.

An arbitrary code execution vulnerability in Rockwell Automation Arena Simulation could let a malicious user insert unauthorized code into the software. This is done by writing beyond the designated memory area, which causes an access violation. Once inside, the threat actor can run harmful code on the system. This affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the product. To trigger this, the user would unwittingly need to open a malicious file shared by the threat actor.

This happens because create_pending_snapshot() initializes the new root
item as a copy of the source root item. This includes the refs field,
which is 0 for a deleted subvolume. The call to btrfs_insert_root()
therefore inserts a root with refs == 0. btrfs_get_new_fs_root() then
finds the root and returns -ENOENT if refs == 0, which causes
create_pending_snapshot() to abort.

Fix it by checking the source root's refs before attempting the
snapshot, but after locking subvol_sem to avoid racing with deletion."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

The problem appears to be caused by CPU reordering of writes issued from
__tracing_map_insert().

The check for the presence of an element with a given key in this
function is:

 val = READ_ONCE(entry->val);
 if (val && keys_match(key, val->key, map->key_size)) ...

The write of a new entry is:

 elt = get_free_elt(map);
 memcpy(elt->key, key, map->key_size);
 entry->val = elt;

The ""memcpy(elt->key, key, map->key_size);"" and ""entry->val = elt;""
stores may become visible in the reversed order on another CPU. This
second CPU might then incorrectly determine that a new key doesn't match
an already present val->key and subse

Airflow's local file task handler in Airflow incorrectly set permissions for all parent folders of log folder, in default configuration adding write access to Unix group of the folders. In the case Airflow is run with the root user (not recommended) it added group write permission to all folders up to the root of the filesystem.

If your log files are stored in the home directory, these permission changes might impact your ability to run SSH operations after your home directory becomes group-writeable.

This issue does not affect users who use or extend Airflow using Official Airflow Docker reference images ( https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow/ ) - those images require to have group write permission set anyway.

You are affected only if you install Airflow using local installation / virtualenv or other Docker images, but the issue has no impact if docker containers are used as intended, i.e. where Airflow components do not share containers with other applications and users.

Also you should not be affected if your umask is 002 (group write enabled) - this is the default on many linux systems.

Recommendation for users using Airflow outside of the containers:

  *  if you are using root to run Airflow, change your Airflow user to use non-root
  *  upgrade Apache Airflow to 2.8.4 or above
  *  If you prefer not to upgrade, you can change the  https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#file-task-handler-new-folder-permissions  to 0o755 (original value 0o775).
  *  if you already ran Airflow tasks before and your default umask is 022 (group write disabled) you should stop Airflow components, check permissions of AIRFLOW_HOME/logs in all your components and all parent directories of this directory and remove group write access for all the parent directories"	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

drm/amd/display: Refactor DMCUB enter/exit idle interface

[Why]
We can hang in place trying to send commands when the DMCUB isn't
powered on.

[How]
We need to exit out of the idle state prior to sending a command,
but the process that performs the exit also invokes a command itself.

Fixing this issue involves the following:

1. Using a software state to track whether or not we need to start
   the process to exit idle or notify idle.

It's possible for the hardware to have exited an idle state without
driver knowledge, but entering one is always restricted to a driver
allow - which makes the SW state vs HW state mismatch issue purely one
of optimization, which should seldomly be hit, if at all.

2. Refactor any instances of exit/notify idle to use a single wrapper
   that maintains this SW state.

This works simialr to dc_allow_idle_optimizations, but works at the
DMCUB level and makes sure the state is marked prior to any notify/exit
idle so we don't enter an infinite loop.

3. Make sure we exit out of idle prior to sending any commands or
   waiting for DMCUB idle.

This patch takes care of 1/2. A future patch will take care of wrapping
DMCUB command submission with calls to this new interface."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

iio: adc: ad7091r: Allow users to configure device events

AD7091R-5 devices are supported by the ad7091r-5 driver together with

user space when ADC readings fall bellow the thresholds of low limit
registers or above the values set in high limit registers.
However, to configure iio events and their thresholds, a set of callback
functions must be implemented and those were not present until now.
The consequence of trying to configure ad7091r-5 events without the
proper callback functions was a null pointer dereference in the kernel
because the pointers to the callback functions were not set.

Implement event configuration callbacks allowing users to read/write
event thresholds and enable/disable event generation.

thermal: intel: hfi: Add syscore callbacks for system-wide PM

The kernel allocates a memory buffer and provides its location to the
hardware, which uses it to update the HFI table. This allocation occurs
during boot and remains constant throughout runtime.

When resuming from hibernation, the restore kernel allocates a second
memory buffer and reprograms the HFI hardware with the new location as
part of a normal boot. The location of the second memory buffer may
differ from the one allocated by the image kernel.

When the restore kernel transfers control to the image kernel, its HFI
buffer becomes invalid, potentially leading to memory corruption if the
hardware writes to it (the hardware continues to use the buffer from the
restore kernel).

It is also possible that the hardware ""forgets"" the address of the memory
buffer when resuming from ""deep"" suspend. Memory corruption may also occur
in such a scenario.

To prevent the described memory corruption, disable HFI when preparing to
suspend or hibernate. Enable it when resuming.

Add syscore callbacks to handle the package of the boot CPU (packages of
non-boot CPUs are handled via CPU offline). Syscore ops always run on the
boot CPU. Additionally, HFI only needs to be disabled during ""deep"" suspend
and hibernation. Syscore ops only run in these cases.

This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2023-52629	2024-03-29T10:15:09.327	2025-04-08T19:28:53.087	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sh: push-switch: Reorder cleanup operations to avoid use-after-free bug

The original code puts flush_work() before timer_shutdown_sync()
in switch_drv_remove(). Although we use flush_work() to stop
the worker, it could be rescheduled in switch_timer(). As a result,
a use-after-free bug can occur. The details are shown below:

      (cpu 0)                    |      (cpu 1)
switch_drv_remove()              |
 flush_work()                    |
  ...                            |  switch_timer // timer
                                 |   schedule_work(&psw->work)
 timer_shutdown_sync()           |
 ...                             |  switch_work_handler // worker
 kfree(psw) // free              |
                                 |   psw->state = 0 // use

This patch puts timer_shutdown_sync() before flush_work() to
mitigate the bugs. As a result, the worker and timer will be
stopped safely before the deallocate operations."	8.4	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

All versions of ArgoCD starting from v2.4 have a bug where the ArgoCD repo-server component is vulnerable to a Denial-of-Service attack vector. Specifically,  it's possible to crash the repo server component through an out of memory error by pointing it to a malicious Helm registry. The loadRepoIndex() function in the ArgoCD's helm package, does not limit the size nor time while fetching the data. It fetches it and creates a byte slice from the retrieved data in one go. If the registry is implemented to push data continuously, the repo server will keep allocating memory until it runs out of it. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in v2.10.3, v2.9.8, and v2.8.12.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
