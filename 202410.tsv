CVE-2024-8508	2024-10-03T17:15:15.323	2024-12-17T19:28:03.767	NLnet Labs Unbound up to and including version 1.21.0 contains a vulnerability when handling replies with very large RRsets that it needs to perform name compression for. Malicious upstreams responses with very large RRsets can cause Unbound to spend a considerable time applying name compression to downstream replies. This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of service in well orchestrated attacks. The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious actor querying Unbound for the specially crafted contents of a malicious zone with very large RRsets. Before Unbound replies to the query it will try to apply name compression which was an unbounded operation that could lock the CPU until the whole packet was complete. Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the number of name compression calculations it is willing to do per packet. Packets that need more compression will result in semi-compressed packets or truncated packets, even on TCP for huge messages, to avoid locking the CPU for long. This change should not affect normal DNS traffic.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

This occurred even if the configuration schema specified that they should have backend or secret visibility. This was an intended feature of the APP_CONFIG_* way of supplying configuration, but now clearly goes against the expected behavior of the configuration system. This behavior leads to a risk of potentially exposing sensitive configuration details intended to remain private or restricted to backend processes. The issue has been resolved in version 0.3.75 of the @backstage/plugin-app-backend package. As a temporary measure, avoid supplying secrets using the APP_CONFIG_ configuration pattern.

The HtmlGenerator class is subject to potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attack through a parsed malformed Minecraft server MOTD. The HtmlGenerator iterates through objects of MotdItem that are contained in an object of MotdItemCollection to generate a HTML string. An attacker can make malicious inputs to the color and text properties of MotdItem to inject own HTML into a web page during web page generation. For example by sending a malicious MOTD from a Minecraft server under their control that was queried and passed to the HtmlGenerator. This XSS vulnerability exists because the values of these properties are neither filtered nor escaped. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.6.	6.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

When closing a buffer (visible in a window) a BufWinLeave auto command can cause an use-after-free if this auto command happens to re-open the same buffer in a new split window. Impact is low since the user must have intentionally set up such a strange auto command and run some buffer unload commands. However this may lead to a crash. This issue has been addressed in version 9.1.0764 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	3.9	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L

CVE-2024-47822	2024-10-08T18:15:31.170	2025-04-14T12:15:14.970	Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Access tokens from query strings are not redacted and are potentially exposed in system logs which may be persisted. The access token in `req.query` is not redacted when the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. If these logs are not properly sanitized or protected, an attacker with access to it can potentially gain administrative control, leading to unauthorized data access and manipulation. This impacts systems where the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. The `access_token` in the query could potentially be a long-lived static token. Users with impacted systems should rotate their static tokens if they were provided using query string. This vulnerability has been patched in release version 10.13.2 and subsequent releases as well. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	4.2	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2024-47823	2024-10-08T18:15:31.370	2025-03-06T18:06:52.687	Livewire is a full-stack framework for Laravel that allows for dynamic UI components without leaving PHP. In livewire/livewire prior to `2.12.7` and `v3.5.2`, the file extension of an uploaded file is guessed based on the MIME type. As a result, the actual file extension from the file name is not validated. An attacker can therefore bypass the validation by uploading a file with a valid MIME type (e.g., `image/png`) and a “.php” file extension. If the following criteria are met, the attacker can carry out an RCE attack: 1. Filename is composed of the original file name using `$file->getClientOriginalName()`. 2. Files stored directly on your server in a public storage disk. 3. Webserver is configured to execute “.php” files. This issue has been addressed in release versions `2.12.7` and `3.5.2`. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Due to insufficient input validation, the C-MOR web interface is vulnerable to OS command injection attacks. It was found out that different functionality is vulnerable to OS command injection attacks, for example for generating new X.509 certificates, or setting the time zone. These OS command injection vulnerabilities in the script generatesslreq.pml can be exploited as a low-privileged authenticated user to execute commands in the context of the Linux user www-data via shell metacharacters in HTTP POST data (e.g., the city parameter). The OS command injection vulnerability in the script settimezone.pml or setdatetime.pml (e.g., via the year parameter) requires an administrative user for the C-MOR web interface. By also exploiting a privilege-escalation vulnerability, it is possible to execute commands on the C-MOR system with root privileges.	7.2	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

drm/amd/display: Disable DMCUB timeout for DCN35

[Why]
DMCUB can intermittently take longer than expected to process commands.

Old ASIC policy was to continue while logging a diagnostic error - which
works fine for ASIC without IPS, but with IPS this could lead to a race
condition where we attempt to access DCN state while it's inaccessible,
leading to a system hang when the NIU port is not disabled or register
accesses that timeout and the display configuration in an undefined
state.

[How]
We need to investigate why these accesses take longer than expected, but
for now we should disable the timeout on DCN35 to avoid this race
condition. Since the waits happen only at lower interrupt levels the
risk of taking too long at higher IRQ and causing a system watchdog
timeout are minimal."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

smack: tcp: ipv4, fix incorrect labeling

Currently, Smack mirrors the label of incoming tcp/ipv4 connections:
when a label 'foo' connects to a label 'bar' with tcp/ipv4,
'foo' always gets 'foo' in returned ipv4 packets. So,
1) returned packets are incorrectly labeled ('foo' instead of 'bar')
2) 'bar' can write to 'foo' without being authorized to write.

Here is a scenario how to see this:

* Take two machines, let's call them C and S,
   with active Smack in the default state
   (no settings, no rules, no labeled hosts, only builtin labels)

* At S, add Smack rule 'foo bar w'
   (labels 'foo' and 'bar' are instantiated at S at this moment)

* At S, at label 'bar', launch a program
   that listens for incoming tcp/ipv4 connections

* From C, at label 'foo', connect to the listener at S.
   (label 'foo' is instantiated at C at this moment)
   Connection succeedes and works.

* Send some data in both directions.
* Collect network traffic of this connection.

All packets in both directions are labeled with the CIPSO
of the label 'foo'. Hence, label 'bar' writes to 'foo' without
being authorized, and even without ever being known at C.

If anybody cares: exactly the same happens with DCCP.

This behavior 1st manifested in release 2.6.29.4 (see Fixes below)
and it looks unintentional. At least, no explanation was provided.

I changed returned packes label into the 'bar',
to bring it into line with the Smack documentation claims."	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

In some setups directories can have many (usually negative) dentries.
Hence __fsnotify_update_child_dentry_flags() function can take a
significant amount of time. Since the bulk of this function happens
under inode->i_lock this causes a significant contention on the lock
when we remove the watch from the directory as the
__fsnotify_update_child_dentry_flags() call from fsnotify_recalc_mask()
races with __fsnotify_update_child_dentry_flags() calls from
__fsnotify_parent() happening on children. This can lead upto softlockup
reports reported by users.

Fix the problem by calling fsnotify_update_children_dentry_flags() to
set PARENT_WATCHED flags only when parent starts watching children.

When parent stops watching children, clear false positive PARENT_WATCHED
flags lazily in __fsnotify_parent() for each accessed child."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

nilfs2: fix state management in error path of log writing function

After commit a694291a6211 (""nilfs2: separate wait function from
nilfs_segctor_write"") was applied, the log writing function
nilfs_segctor_do_construct() was able to issue I/O requests continuously
even if user data blocks were split into multiple logs across segments,
but two potential flaws were introduced in its error handling.

First, if nilfs_segctor_begin_construction() fails while creating the
second or subsequent logs, the log writing function returns without
calling nilfs_segctor_abort_construction(), so the writeback flag set on
pages/folios will remain uncleared.  This causes page cache operations to
hang waiting for the writeback flag.  For example,
truncate_inode_pages_final(), which is called via nilfs_evict_inode() when
an inode is evicted from memory, will hang.

Second, the NILFS_I_COLLECTED flag set on normal inodes remain uncleared. 
As a result, if the next log write involves checkpoint creation, that's
fine, but if a partial log write is performed that does not, inodes with
NILFS_I_COLLECTED set are erroneously removed from the ""sc_dirty_files""
list, and their data and b-tree blocks may not be written to the device,
corrupting the block mapping.

Fix these issues by uniformly calling nilfs_segctor_abort_construction()
on failure of each step in the loop in nilfs_segctor_do_construct(),
having it clean up logs and segment usages according to progress, and
correcting the conditions for calling nilfs_redirty_inodes() to ensure
that the NILFS_I_COLLECTED flag is cleared."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-47763	2024-10-09T18:15:08.863	2025-09-29T13:26:36.703	"Wasmtime is an open source runtime for WebAssembly. Wasmtime's implementation of WebAssembly tail calls combined with stack traces can result in a runtime crash in certain WebAssembly modules. The runtime crash may be undefined behavior if Wasmtime was compiled with Rust 1.80 or prior. The runtime crash is a deterministic process abort when Wasmtime is compiled with Rust 1.81 and later. WebAssembly tail calls are a proposal which relatively recently reached stage 4 in the standardization process. Wasmtime first enabled support for tail calls by default in Wasmtime 21.0.0, although that release contained a bug where it was only on-by-default for some configurations. In Wasmtime 22.0.0 tail calls were enabled by default for all configurations. The specific crash happens when an exported function in a WebAssembly module (or component) performs a `return_call` (or `return_call_indirect` or `return_call_ref`) to an imported host function which captures a stack trace (for example, the host function raises a trap). In this situation, the stack-walking code previously assumed there was always at least one WebAssembly frame on the stack but with tail calls that is no longer true. With the tail-call proposal it's possible to have an entry trampoline appear as if it directly called the exit trampoline. This situation triggers an internal assert in the stack-walking code which raises a Rust `panic!()`. When Wasmtime is compiled with Rust versions 1.80 and prior this means that an `extern ""C""` function in Rust is raising a `panic!()`. This is technically undefined behavior and typically manifests as a process abort when the unwinder fails to unwind Cranelift-generated frames. When Wasmtime is compiled with Rust versions 1.81 and later this panic becomes a deterministic process abort. Overall the impact of this issue is that this is a denial-of-service vector where a malicious WebAssembly module or component can cause the host to crash. There is no other impact at this time other than availability of a service as the result of the crash is always a crash and no more. This issue was discovered by routine fuzzing performed by the Wasmtime project via Google's OSS-Fuzz infrastructure. We have no evidence that it has ever been exploited by an attacker in the wild. All versions of Wasmtime which have tail calls enabled by default have been patched: * 21.0.x - patched in 21.0.2 * 22.0.x - patched in 22.0.1 * 23.0.x - patched in 23.0.3  * 24.0.x - patched in 24.0.1 * 25.0.x - patched in 25.0.2. Wasmtime versions from 12.0.x (the first release with experimental tail call support) to 20.0.x (the last release with tail-calls off-by-default) have support for tail calls but the support is disabled by default. These versions are not affected in their default configurations, but users who explicitly enabled tail call support will need to either disable tail call support or upgrade to a patched version of Wasmtime. The main workaround for this issue is to disable tail support for tail calls in Wasmtime, for example with `Config::wasm_tail_call(false)`. Users are otherwise encouraged to upgrade to patched versions."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2024-47813	2024-10-09T18:15:09.120	2025-09-29T13:11:34.543	"Wasmtime is an open source runtime for WebAssembly. Under certain concurrent event orderings, a `wasmtime::Engine`'s internal type registry was susceptible to double-unregistration bugs due to a race condition, leading to panics and potentially type registry corruption. That registry corruption could, following an additional and particular sequence of concurrent events, lead to violations of WebAssembly's control-flow integrity (CFI) and type safety. Users that do not use `wasmtime::Engine` across multiple threads are not affected. Users that only create new modules across threads over time are additionally not affected. Reproducing this bug requires creating and dropping multiple type instances (such as `wasmtime::FuncType` or `wasmtime::ArrayType`) concurrently on multiple threads, where all types are associated with the same `wasmtime::Engine`. **Wasm guests cannot trigger this bug.** See the ""References"" section below for a list of Wasmtime types-related APIs that are affected. Wasmtime maintains an internal registry of types within a `wasmtime::Engine` and an engine is shareable across threads. Types can be created and referenced through creation of a `wasmtime::Module`, creation of `wasmtime::FuncType`, or a number of other APIs where the host creates a function (see ""References"" below). Each of these cases interacts with an engine to deduplicate type information and manage type indices that are used to implement type checks in WebAssembly's `call_indirect` function, for example. This bug is a race condition in this management where the internal type registry could be corrupted to trigger an assert or contain invalid state. Wasmtime's internal representation of a type has individual types (e.g. one-per-host-function) maintain a registration count of how many time it's been used. Types additionally have state within an engine behind a read-write lock such as lookup/deduplication information. The race here is a time-of-check versus time-of-use (TOCTOU) bug where one thread atomically decrements a type entry's registration count, observes zero registrations, and then acquires a lock in order to unregister that entry. However, between when this first thread observed the zero-registration count and when it acquires that lock, another thread could perform the following sequence of events: re-register another copy of the type, which deduplicates to that same entry, resurrecting it and incrementing its registration count; then drop the type and decrement its registration count; observe that the registration count is now zero; acquire the type registry lock; and finally unregister the type. Now, when the original thread finally acquires the lock and unregisters the entry, it is the second time this entry has been unregistered. This bug was originally introduced in Wasmtime 19's development of the WebAssembly GC proposal. This bug affects users who are not using the GC proposal, however, and affects Wasmtime in its default configuration even when the GC proposal is disabled. Wasmtime users using 19.0.0 and after are all affected by this issue. We have released the following Wasmtime versions, all of which have a fix for this bug: * 21.0.2 * 22.0.1 * 23.0.3 * 24.0.1 * 25.0.2. If your application creates and drops Wasmtime types on multiple threads concurrently, there are no known workarounds.

CVE-2024-47084	2024-10-10T22:15:10.263	2024-10-17T16:30:59.790	Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability is related to **CORS origin validation**, where the Gradio server fails to validate the request origin when a cookie is present. This allows an attacker’s website to make unauthorized requests to a local Gradio server. Potentially, attackers can upload files, steal authentication tokens, and access user data if the victim visits a malicious website while logged into Gradio. This impacts users who have deployed Gradio locally and use basic authentication. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>4.44` to address this issue. As a workaround, users can manually enforce stricter CORS origin validation by modifying the `CustomCORSMiddleware` class in their local Gradio server code. Specifically, they can bypass the condition that skips CORS validation for requests containing cookies to prevent potential exploitation.	8.3	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L

This vulnerability relates to the **bypass of directory traversal checks** within the `is_in_or_equal` function. This function, intended to check if a file resides within a given directory, can be bypassed with certain payloads that manipulate file paths using `..` (parent directory) sequences. Attackers could potentially access restricted files if they are able to exploit this flaw, although the difficulty is high. This primarily impacts users relying on Gradio’s blocklist or directory access validation, particularly when handling file uploads. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=5.0` to address this issue. As a workaround, users can manually sanitize and normalize file paths in their Gradio deployment before passing them to the `is_in_or_equal` function. Ensuring that all file paths are properly resolved and absolute can help mitigate the bypass vulnerabilities caused by the improper handling of `..` sequences or malformed paths.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

This impacts users running Gradio locally, especially those using basic authentication. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=5.0` to address this issue. As a workaround, users can manually modify the `localhost_aliases` list in their local Gradio deployment to exclude ""null"" as a valid origin. By removing this value, the Gradio server will no longer accept requests from sandboxed iframes or sources with a null origin, mitigating the potential for exploitation."	5.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

This vulnerability involves a **one-level read path traversal** in the `/custom_component` endpoint. Attackers can exploit this flaw to access and leak source code from custom Gradio components by manipulating the file path in the request. Although the traversal is limited to a single directory level, it could expose proprietary or sensitive code that developers intended to keep private. This impacts users who have developed custom Gradio components and are hosting them on publicly accessible servers. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=4.44` to address this issue. As a workaround, developers can sanitize the file paths and ensure that components are not stored in publicly accessible directories.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

This vulnerability relates to **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** in the `/queue/join` endpoint. Gradio’s `async_save_url_to_cache` function allows attackers to force the Gradio server to send HTTP requests to user-controlled URLs. This could enable attackers to target internal servers or services within a local network and possibly exfiltrate data or cause unwanted internal requests. Additionally, the content from these URLs is stored locally, making it easier for attackers to upload potentially malicious files to the server. This impacts users deploying Gradio servers that use components like the Video component which involve URL fetching. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=5` to address this issue.  As a workaround, users can disable or heavily restrict URL-based inputs in their Gradio applications to trusted domains only. Additionally, implementing stricter URL validation (such as allowinglist-based validation) and ensuring that local or internal network addresses cannot be requested via the `/queue/join` endpoint can help mitigate the risk of SSRF attacks.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

This vulnerability is a **lack of integrity check** on the downloaded FRP client, which could potentially allow attackers to introduce malicious code. If an attacker gains access to the remote URL from which the FRP client is downloaded, they could modify the binary without detection, as the Gradio server does not verify the file's checksum or signature.  Any users utilizing the Gradio server's sharing mechanism that downloads the FRP client could be affected by this vulnerability, especially those relying on the executable binary for secure data tunneling. There is no direct workaround for this issue without upgrading. However, users can manually validate the integrity of the downloaded FRP client by implementing checksum or signature verification in their own environment to ensure the binary hasn't been tampered with.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2024-47868	2024-10-10T23:15:02.797	2024-10-17T17:04:35.547	Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This is a **data validation vulnerability** affecting several Gradio components, which allows arbitrary file leaks through the post-processing step. Attackers can exploit these components by crafting requests that bypass expected input constraints. This issue could lead to sensitive files being exposed to unauthorized users, especially when combined with other vulnerabilities, such as issue TOB-GRADIO-15. The components most at risk are those that return or handle file data. Vulnerable Components: 1. **String to FileData:** DownloadButton, Audio, ImageEditor, Video, Model3D, File, UploadButton. 2. **Complex data to FileData:** Chatbot, MultimodalTextbox. 3. **Direct file read in preprocess:** Code. 4. **Dictionary converted to FileData:** ParamViewer, Dataset. Exploit Scenarios: 1. A developer creates a Dropdown list that passes values to a DownloadButton. An attacker bypasses the allowed inputs, sends an arbitrary file path (like `/etc/passwd`), and downloads sensitive files. 2. An attacker crafts a malicious payload in a ParamViewer component, leaking sensitive files from a server through the arbitrary file leak. This issue has been resolved in `gradio>5.0`.

CVE-2024-47869	2024-10-10T23:15:02.930	2024-10-17T16:59:04.703	Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability involves a **timing attack** in the way Gradio compares hashes for the `analytics_dashboard` function. Since the comparison is not done in constant time, an attacker could exploit this by measuring the response time of different requests to infer the correct hash byte-by-byte. This can lead to unauthorized access to the analytics dashboard, especially if the attacker can repeatedly query the system with different keys. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>4.44` to mitigate this issue. To mitigate the risk before applying the patch, developers can manually patch the `analytics_dashboard` dashboard to use a **constant-time comparison** function for comparing sensitive values, such as hashes. Alternatively, access to the analytics dashboard can be disabled.	3.7	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

CVE-2024-47871	2024-10-10T23:15:03.187	2024-10-17T17:11:31.150	Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability involves **insecure communication** between the FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy) client and server when Gradio's `share=True` option is used. HTTPS is not enforced on the connection, allowing attackers to intercept and read files uploaded to the Gradio server, as well as modify responses or data sent between the client and server. This impacts users who are sharing Gradio demos publicly over the internet using `share=True` without proper encryption, exposing sensitive data to potential eavesdroppers. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=5` to address this issue. As a workaround, users can avoid using `share=True` in production environments and instead host their Gradio applications on servers with HTTPS enabled to ensure secure communication.	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2024-47872	2024-10-10T23:15:03.303	2024-10-17T16:54:34.383	Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability involves **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** on any Gradio server that allows file uploads. Authenticated users can upload files such as HTML, JavaScript, or SVG files containing malicious scripts. When other users download or view these files, the scripts will execute in their browser, allowing attackers to perform unauthorized actions or steal sensitive information from their sessions. This impacts any Gradio server that allows file uploads, particularly those using components that process or display user-uploaded files. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=5` to address this issue. As a workaround, users can restrict the types of files that can be uploaded to the Gradio server by limiting uploads to non-executable file types such as images or text. Additionally, developers can implement server-side validation to sanitize uploaded files, ensuring that HTML, JavaScript, and SVG files are properly handled or rejected before being stored or displayed to users.	5.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

The configuration directives provided by the headers handler allows users to modify the response headers being sent by h2o. The configuration file of h2o has scopes, and the inner scopes (e.g., path level) are expected to inherit the configuration defined in outer scopes (e.g., global level).

Depending on the headers being added or removed unexpectedly, this behavior could lead to unexpected client behavior.

When an HTTP request using TLS/1.3 early data on top of TCP Fast Open or QUIC 0-RTT packets is received and the IP-address-based access control is used, the access control does not detect and prohibit HTTP requests conveyed by packets with a spoofed source address. This behavior allows attackers on the network to execute HTTP requests from addresses that are otherwise rejected by the address-based access control. The vulnerability has been addressed in commit 15ed15a. Users may disable the use of TCP FastOpen and QUIC to mitigate the issue.	5.9	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

When parsing a spoofed TLS handshake message, picotls (specifically, bindings within picotls that call the crypto libraries) may attempt to free the same memory twice. This double free occurs during the disposal of multiple objects without any intervening calls to malloc Typically, this triggers the malloc implementation to detect the error and abort the process. However, depending on the internals of malloc and the crypto backend being used, the flaw could potentially lead to a use-after-free scenario, which might allow for arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2024-42018	2024-10-11T17:15:03.573	2024-11-06T20:35:23.377	An issue was discovered in Atos Eviden SMC xScale before 1.6.6. During initialization of nodes, some configuration parameters are retrieved from management nodes. These parameters embed credentials whose integrity and confidentiality may be important to the security of the HPC configuration. Because these parameters are needed for initialization, there is no available mechanism to ensure access control on the management node, and a mitigation measure is normally put in place to prevent access to unprivileged users. It was discovered that this mitigation measure does not survive a reboot of diskful nodes. (Diskless nodes are not at risk.) The mistake lies in the cloudinit configuration: the iptables configuration should have been in the bootcmd instead of the runcmd section.	7.7	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVE-2024-38365	2024-10-11T20:15:04.733	2025-08-20T19:23:36.953	"btcd is an alternative full node bitcoin implementation written in Go (golang). The btcd Bitcoin client (versions 0.10 to 0.24) did not correctly re-implement Bitcoin Core's ""FindAndDelete()"" functionality. This logic is consensus-critical: the difference in behavior with the other Bitcoin clients can lead to btcd clients accepting an invalid Bitcoin block (or rejecting a valid one). This consensus failure can be leveraged to cause a chain split (accepting an invalid Bitcoin block) or be exploited to DoS the btcd nodes (rejecting a valid Bitcoin block). An attacker can create a standard transaction where FindAndDelete doesn't return a match but removeOpCodeByData does making btcd get a different sighash, leading to a chain split. Importantly, this vulnerability can be exploited remotely by any Bitcoin user and does not require any hash power. This is because the difference in behavior can be triggered by a ""standard"" Bitcoin transaction, that is a transaction which gets relayed through the P2P network before it gets included in a Bitcoin block. `removeOpcodeByData(script []byte, dataToRemove []byte)` removes any data pushes from `script` that contain `dataToRemove`. However, `FindAndDelete` only removes exact matches. So for example, with `script = ""<data> <data||foo>""` and `dataToRemove = ""data""` btcd will remove both data pushes but Bitcoin Core's `FindAndDelete` only removes the first `<data>` push. This has been patched in btcd version v0.24.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."	7.4	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H

mm: avoid leaving partial pfn mappings around in error case

As Jann points out, PFN mappings are special, because unlike normal
memory mappings, there is no lifetime information associated with the
mapping - it is just a raw mapping of PFNs with no reference counting of
a 'struct page'.

That's all very much intentional, but it does mean that it's easy to
mess up the cleanup in case of errors.  Yes, a failed mmap() will always
eventually clean up any partial mappings, but without any explicit
lifetime in the page table mapping itself, it's very easy to do the
error handling in the wrong order.

In particular, it's easy to mistakenly free the physical backing store
before the page tables are actually cleaned up and (temporarily) have
stale dangling PTE entries.

To make this situation less error-prone, just make sure that any partial
pfn mapping is torn down early, before any other error handling."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-47779	2024-10-15T16:15:04.963	2024-11-12T17:15:08.037	Element is a Matrix web client built using the Matrix React SDK. Element Web versions 1.11.70 through 1.11.80 contain a vulnerability which can, under specially crafted conditions, lead to the access token becoming exposed to third parties. At least one vector has been identified internally, involving malicious widgets, but other vectors may exist. Note that despite superficial similarity to CVE-2024-47771, this is an entirely separate vulnerability, caused by a separate piece of code included only in Element Web. Element Web and Element Desktop share most but not all, of their code and this vulnerability exists in the part of the code base which is not shared between the projects. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to version 1.11.81 to remediate the issue. As a workaround, avoid granting permissions to untrusted widgets.					
CVE-2024-47824	2024-10-15T16:15:05.120	2024-11-21T17:15:17.650	matrix-react-sdk is react-based software development kit for inserting a Matrix chat/VOIP client into a web page. Starting in version 3.18.0 and before 3.102.0, matrix-react-sdk allows a malicious homeserver to potentially steal message keys for a room when a user invites another user to that room, via injection of a malicious device controlled by the homeserver. This is possible because matrix-react-sdk before 3.102.0 shared historical message keys on invite. Version 3.102.0 fixes this issue by disabling sharing message keys on invite by removing calls to the vulnerable functionality. No known workarounds are available.					
CVE-2024-47874	2024-10-15T16:15:05.260	2024-11-21T17:15:17.990	Starlette is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework/toolkit. Prior to version 0.40.0, Starlette treats `multipart/form-data` parts without a `filename` as text form fields and buffers those in byte strings with no size limit. This allows an attacker to upload arbitrary large form fields and cause Starlette to both slow down significantly due to excessive memory allocations and copy operations, and also consume more and more memory until the server starts swapping and grinds to a halt, or the OS terminates the server process with an OOM error. Uploading multiple such requests in parallel may be enough to render a service practically unusable, even if reasonable request size limits are enforced by a reverse proxy in front of Starlette. This Denial of service (DoS) vulnerability affects all applications built with Starlette (or FastAPI) accepting form requests. Verison 0.40.0 fixes this issue.					
CVE-2024-47876	2024-10-15T16:15:05.420	2024-11-21T17:15:18.227	Sakai is a Collaboration and Learning Environment.

Although the CSRF middleware verifies the Content-Type Header, Hono always considers a request without a Content-Type header to be safe. This can allow an attacker to bypass CSRF protection implemented with Hono CSRF middleware. Version 4.6.5 fixes this issue.	5.9	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2024-48914	2024-10-15T16:15:06.270	2024-10-16T16:38:43.170	Vendure is an open-source headless commerce platform. Prior to versions 3.0.5 and 2.3.3, a vulnerability in Vendure's asset server plugin allows an attacker to craft a request which is able to traverse the server file system and retrieve the contents of arbitrary files, including sensitive data such as configuration files, environment variables, and other critical data stored on the server. In the same code path is an additional vector for crashing the server via a malformed URI. Patches are available in versions 3.0.5 and 2.3.3. Some workarounds are also available. One may use object storage rather than the local file system, e.g. MinIO or S3, or define middleware which detects and blocks requests with urls containing `/../`.	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H

A symlink traversal vulnerability in the containers/storage library can cause Podman, Buildah, and CRI-O to hang and result in a denial of service via OOM kill when running a malicious image using an automatically assigned user namespace (`--userns=auto` in Podman and Buildah). The containers/storage library will read /etc/passwd inside the container, but does not properly validate if that file is a symlink, which can be used to cause the library to read an arbitrary file on the host.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2024-48915	2024-10-15T17:15:11.943	2024-11-21T17:15:20.387	Agent Dart is an agent library built for Internet Computer for Dart and Flutter apps. Prior to version 1.0.0-dev.29, certificate verification in `lib/agent/certificate.dart` does not occur properly. During the delegation verification in the `_checkDelegation` function, the canister_ranges aren't verified. The impact of not checking the canister_ranges is that a subnet can sign canister responses in behalf of another subnet. The certificate’s timestamp, i.e /time path, is also not verified, meaning that the certificate effectively has no expiration time. Version 1.0.0-dev.29 implements appropriate certificate verification.

Due to missing validation checks for KVM-compatible templates or volumes in CloudStack 4.0.0 through 4.18.2.3 and 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.1.1, an attacker that can upload or register templates and volumes, can use them to deploy malicious instances or attach uploaded volumes to their existing instances on KVM-based environments and exploit this to gain access to the host filesystems that could result in the compromise of resource integrity and confidentiality, data loss, denial of service, and availability of KVM-based infrastructure managed by CloudStack.


Users are recommended to upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.18.2.4 or 4.19.1.2, or later, which addresses this issue. 

Additionally, all user-uploaded or registered KVM-compatible templates and volumes can be scanned and checked that they are flat files that should not be using any additional or unnecessary features. For example, operators can run this on their secondary storage(s) and inspect output. An empty output for the disk being validated means it has no references to the host filesystems; on the other hand, if the output for the disk being validated is not empty, it might indicate a compromised disk.


for file in $(find /path/to/storage/ -type f -regex [a-f0-9\-]*.*); do echo ""Retrieving file [$file] info. If the output is not empty, that might indicate a compromised disk; check it carefully.""; qemu-img info -U $file | grep file: ; printf ""\n\n""; done
The command can also be run for the file-based primary storages; however, bear in mind that (i) volumes created from templates will have references for the templates at first and (ii) volumes can be consolidated while migrating, losing their references to the templates. Therefore, the command execution for the primary storages can show both false positives and false negatives.

CVE-2024-9143	2024-10-16T17:15:18.130	2025-09-01T09:15:34.447	"Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted
explicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads
or writes.

Impact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or
even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols
involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only ""named
curves"" are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they
specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent
problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable
application is low.

In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates,
so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509
certificates.  Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an ""exotic""
curve encoding.

The affected APIs include: EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(),
and various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions.

Applications working with ""exotic"" explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters,
that make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero
constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a
result of reading or writing outside of array bounds.  Remote code execution
cannot easily be ruled out.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue."	4.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

CVE-2024-48918	2024-10-16T21:15:13.650	2024-10-18T12:53:04.627	RDS Light is a simplified version of the Reflective Dialogue System (RDS), a self-reflecting AI framework. Versions prior to 1.1.0 contain a vulnerability that involves a lack of input validation within the RDS AI framework, specifically within the user input handling code in the main module (`main.py`). This leaves the framework open to injection attacks and potential memory tampering. Any user or external actor providing input to the system could exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious commands, corrupt stored data, or affect API calls. This is particularly critical for users employing RDS AI in production environments where it interacts with sensitive systems, performs dynamic memory caching, or retrieves user-specific data for analysis. Impacted areas include developers using the RDS AI system as a backend for AI-driven applications and systems running RDS AI that may be exposed to untrusted environments or receive unverified user inputs. The vulnerability has been patched in version 1.1.0 of the RDS AI framework. All user inputs are now sanitized and validated against a set of rules designed to mitigate malicious content. Users should upgrade to version 1.1.0 or higher and ensure all dependencies are updated to their latest versions. For users unable to upgrade to the patched version, a workaround can be implemented. The user implementing the workaround should implement custom validation checks for user inputs to filter out unsafe characters and patterns (e.g., SQL injection attempts, script injections) and limit or remove features that allow user input until the system can be patched.

CVE-2024-48924	2024-10-17T21:15:14.070	2024-10-18T12:52:33.507	"### Impact

When this library is used to deserialize messagepack data from an untrusted source, there is a risk of a denial of service attack by an attacker that sends data contrived to produce hash collisions, leading to large CPU consumption disproportionate to the size of the data being deserialized.

This is similar to [a prior advisory](https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q36-4xx7-xcxf), which provided an inadequate fix for the hash collision part of the vulnerability.

### Patches

The following steps are required to mitigate this risk.

1. Upgrade to a version of the library where a fix is available.
1. Review the steps in [this previous advisory](https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q36-4xx7-xcxf) to ensure you have your application configured for untrusted data.

### Workarounds

If upgrading MessagePack to a patched version is not an option for you, you may apply a manual workaround as follows:

1. Declare a class that derives from `MessagePackSecurity`.
2. Override the `GetHashCollisionResistantEqualityComparer<T>` method to provide a collision-resistant hash function of your own and avoid calling `base.GetHashCollisionResistantEqualityComparer<T>()`.
3. Configure a `MessagePackSerializerOptions` with an instance of your derived type by calling `WithSecurity` on an existing options object.
4. Use your custom options object for all deserialization operations. This may be by setting the `MessagePackSerializer.DefaultOptions` static property, if you call methods that rely on this default property, and/or by passing in the options object explicitly to any `Deserialize` method.

### References

- Learn more about best security practices when reading untrusted data with [MessagePack 1.x](https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/tree/v1.x#security) or [MessagePack 2.x](https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp#security).

icmp: change the order of rate limits

ICMP messages are ratelimited :

After the blamed commits, the two rate limiters are applied in this order:

1) host wide ratelimit (icmp_global_allow())

2) Per destination ratelimit (inetpeer based)

In order to avoid side-channels attacks, we need to apply
the per destination check first.

This patch makes the following change :

1) icmp_global_allow() checks if the host wide limit is reached.
   But credits are not yet consumed. This is deferred to 3)

2) The per destination limit is checked/updated.
   This might add a new node in inetpeer tree.

3) icmp_global_consume() consumes tokens if prior operations succeeded.

This means that host wide ratelimit is still effective
in keeping inetpeer tree small even under DDOS.

As a bonus, I removed icmp_global.lock as the fast path
can use a lock-free operation."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

vfs: fix race between evice_inodes() and find_inode()&iput()

Hi, all

Recently I noticed a bug[1] in btrfs, after digged it into
and I believe it'a race in vfs.

Let's assume there's a inode (ie ino 261) with i_count 1 is
called by iput(), and there's a concurrent thread calling
generic_shutdown_super().

cpu0:                              cpu1:
iput() // i_count is 1
  ->spin_lock(inode)
  ->dec i_count to 0
  ->iput_final()                    generic_shutdown_super()
    ->__inode_add_lru()               ->evict_inodes()
      // cause some reason[2]           ->if (atomic_read(inode->i_count)) continue;
      // return before                  // inode 261 passed the above check
      // list_lru_add_obj()             // and then schedule out
   ->spin_unlock()
// note here: the inode 261
// was still at sb list and hash list,
// and I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE was not been set

btrfs_iget()
  // after some function calls
  ->find_inode()
    // found the above inode 261
    ->spin_lock(inode)
   // check I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE
   // and passed
      ->__iget()
    ->spin_unlock(inode)                // schedule back
                                        ->spin_lock(inode)
                                        // check (I_NEW|I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE) flags,
                                        // passed and set I_FREEING
iput()                                  ->spin_unlock(inode)
  ->spin_lock(inode)			  ->evict()
  // dec i_count to 0
  ->iput_final()
    ->spin_unlock()
    ->evict()

Now, we have two threads simultaneously evicting
the same inode, which may trigger the BUG(inode->i_state & I_CLEAR)
statement both within clear_inode() and iput().

To fix the bug, recheck the inode->i_count after holding i_lock.
Because in the most scenarios, the first check is valid, and
the overhead of spin_lock() can be reduced.

If there is any misunderstanding, please let me know, thanks.

CVE-2024-47680	2024-10-21T12:15:05.003	2024-10-24T13:28:28.393	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: check discard support for conventional zones

As the helper function f2fs_bdev_support_discard() shows, f2fs checks if
the target block devices support discard by calling
bdev_max_discard_sectors() and bdev_is_zoned(). This check works well
for most cases, but it does not work for conventional zones on zoned
block devices. F2fs assumes that zoned block devices support discard,
and calls __submit_discard_cmd(). When __submit_discard_cmd() is called
for sequential write required zones, it works fine since
__submit_discard_cmd() issues zone reset commands instead of discard
commands. However, when __submit_discard_cmd() is called for
conventional zones, __blkdev_issue_discard() is called even when the
devices do not support discard.

The inappropriate __blkdev_issue_discard() call was not a problem before
the commit 30f1e7241422 (""block: move discard checks into the ioctl
handler"") because __blkdev_issue_discard() checked if the target devices
support discard or not. If not, it returned EOPNOTSUPP. After the
commit, __blkdev_issue_discard() no longer checks it. It always returns
zero and sets NULL to the given bio pointer. This NULL pointer triggers
f2fs_bug_on() in __submit_discard_cmd(). The BUG is recreated with the
commands below at the umount step, where /dev/nullb0 is a zoned null_blk
with 5GB total size, 128MB zone size and 10 conventional zones.

$ mkfs.f2fs -f -m /dev/nullb0
$ mount /dev/nullb0 /mnt
$ for ((i=0;i<5;i++)); do dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/test bs=65536 count=1600 conv=fsync; done
$ umount /mnt

To fix the BUG, avoid the inappropriate __blkdev_issue_discard() call.
When discard is requested for conventional zones, check if the device
supports discard or not. If not, return EOPNOTSUPP."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

As Christian Brauner pointed out [1]: the root cause is f2fs sets
SB_RDONLY flag in internal function, rather than setting the flag
covered w/ sb->s_umount semaphore via remount procedure, then below
race condition causes this bug:

- freeze_super()
 - sb_wait_write(sb, SB_FREEZE_WRITE)
 - sb_wait_write(sb, SB_FREEZE_PAGEFAULT)
 - sb_wait_write(sb, SB_FREEZE_FS)
					- f2fs_handle_critical_error
					 - sb->s_flags |= SB_RDONLY
- thaw_super
 - thaw_super_locked
  - sb_rdonly() is true, so it skips
    sb_freeze_unlock(sb, SB_FREEZE_FS)
  - deactivate_locked_super

Since f2fs has almost the same logic as ext4 [2] when handling critical
error in filesystem if it mounts w/ errors=remount-ro option:
- set CP_ERROR_FLAG flag which indicates filesystem is stopped
- record errors to superblock
- set SB_RDONLY falg
Once we set CP_ERROR_FLAG flag, all writable interfaces can detect the
flag and stop any further updates on filesystem. So, it is safe to not
set SB_RDONLY flag, let's remove the logic and keep in line w/ ext4 [3].

In the commit aee2424246f9 (""RDMA/iwcm: Fix a use-after-free related to

work queue iwcm_wq.

But at that time, the work queue iwcm_wq was created via the function
alloc_ordered_workqueue without the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM.

Because the current process is trying to flush the whole iwcm_wq, if
iwcm_wq doesn't have the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM, verify that the current
process is not reclaiming memory or running on a workqueue which doesn't
have the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM as that can break forward-progress guarantee

nilfs2: fix potential null-ptr-deref in nilfs_btree_insert()

Patch series ""nilfs2: fix potential issues with empty b-tree nodes"".

This series addresses three potential issues with empty b-tree nodes that
can occur with corrupted filesystem images, including one recently
discovered by syzbot.


This patch (of 3):

If a b-tree is broken on the device, and the b-tree height is greater than
2 (the level of the root node is greater than 1) even if the number of
child nodes of the b-tree root is 0, a NULL pointer dereference occurs in
nilfs_btree_prepare_insert(), which is called from nilfs_btree_insert().

This is because, when the number of child nodes of the b-tree root is 0,
nilfs_btree_do_lookup() does not set the block buffer head in any of
path[x].bp_bh, leaving it as the initial value of NULL, but if the level
of the b-tree root node is greater than 1, nilfs_btree_get_nonroot_node(),
which accesses the buffer memory of path[x].bp_bh, is called.

Fix this issue by adding a check to nilfs_btree_root_broken(), which
performs sanity checks when reading the root node from the device, to
detect this inconsistency.

Thanks to Lizhi Xu for trying to solve the bug and clarifying the cause
early on."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-47702	2024-10-21T12:15:06.743	2024-10-24T13:30:59.247	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fail verification for sign-extension of packet data/data_end/data_meta

syzbot reported a kernel crash due to
  commit 1f1e864b6555 (""bpf: Handle sign-extenstin ctx member accesses"").
The reason is due to sign-extension of 32-bit load for
packet data/data_end/data_meta uapi field.

The original code looks like:
        r2 = *(s32 *)(r1 + 76) /* load __sk_buff->data */
        r3 = *(u32 *)(r1 + 80) /* load __sk_buff->data_end */
        r0 = r2
        r0 += 8
        if r3 > r0 goto +1
        ...
Note that __sk_buff->data load has 32-bit sign extension.

After verification and convert_ctx_accesses(), the final asm code looks like:
        r2 = *(u64 *)(r1 +208)
        r2 = (s32)r2
        r3 = *(u64 *)(r1 +80)
        r0 = r2
        r0 += 8
        if r3 > r0 goto pc+1
        ...
Note that 'r2 = (s32)r2' may make the kernel __sk_buff->data address invalid
which may cause runtime failure.

Currently, in C code, typically we have
        void *data = (void *)(long)skb->data;
        void *data_end = (void *)(long)skb->data_end;
        ...
and it will generate
        r2 = *(u64 *)(r1 +208)
        r3 = *(u64 *)(r1 +80)
        r0 = r2
        r0 += 8
        if r3 > r0 goto pc+1

If we allow sign-extension,
        void *data = (void *)(long)(int)skb->data;
        void *data_end = (void *)(long)skb->data_end;
        ...
the generated code looks like
        r2 = *(u64 *)(r1 +208)
        r2 <<= 32
        r2 s>>= 32
        r3 = *(u64 *)(r1 +80)
        r0 = r2
        r0 += 8
        if r3 > r0 goto pc+1
and this will cause verification failure since ""r2 <<= 32"" is not allowed
as ""r2"" is a packet pointer.

To fix this issue for case
  r2 = *(s32 *)(r1 + 76) /* load __sk_buff->data */
this patch added additional checking in is_valid_access() callback
function for packet data/data_end/data_meta access. If those accesses
are with sign-extenstion, the verification will fail.

block: fix potential invalid pointer dereference in blk_add_partition

The blk_add_partition() function initially used a single if-condition
(IS_ERR(part)) to check for errors when adding a partition. This was
modified to handle the specific case of -ENXIO separately, allowing the
function to proceed without logging the error in this case. However,
this change unintentionally left a path where md_autodetect_dev()
could be called without confirming that part is a valid pointer.

This commit separates the error handling logic by splitting the
initial if-condition, improving code readability and handling specific
error scenarios explicitly. The function now distinguishes the general
error case from -ENXIO without altering the existing behavior of
md_autodetect_dev() calls."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

block, bfq: fix possible UAF for bfqq->bic with merge chain

1) initial state, three tasks:

		 (BIC1)          (BIC2)		 (BIC3)
		  |  Λ            |  Λ		  |  Λ

		  bfqq1           bfqq2		  bfqq3
process ref:	   1		    1		    1

2) bfqq1 merged to bfqq2:

		Process 1       Process 2	Process 3
		 (BIC1)          (BIC2)		 (BIC3)
		  |               |		  |  Λ
		  \--------------\|		  |  |
		                  V		  V  |
		  bfqq1--------->bfqq2		  bfqq3
process ref:	   0		    2		    1

3) bfqq2 merged to bfqq3:

		Process 1       Process 2	Process 3
		 (BIC1)          (BIC2)		 (BIC3)
	 here -> Λ                |		  |

		                  V		  V
		  bfqq1--------->bfqq2---------->bfqq3
process ref:	   0		    1		    3

In this case, IO from Process 1 will get bfqq2 from BIC1 first, and then
get bfqq3 through merge chain, and finially handle IO by bfqq3.
Howerver, current code will think bfqq2 is owned by BIC1, like initial
state, and set bfqq2->bic to BIC1.

bfq_insert_request
-> by Process 1
 bfqq = bfq_init_rq(rq)
  bfqq = bfq_get_bfqq_handle_split
   bfqq = bic_to_bfqq
   -> get bfqq2 from BIC1
 bfqq->ref++
 rq->elv.priv[0] = bic
 rq->elv.priv[1] = bfqq
 if (bfqq_process_refs(bfqq) == 1)
  bfqq->bic = bic
  -> record BIC1 to bfqq2

  __bfq_insert_request
   new_bfqq = bfq_setup_cooperator
   -> get bfqq3 from bfqq2->new_bfqq
   bfqq_request_freed(bfqq)
   new_bfqq->ref++
   rq->elv.priv[1] = new_bfqq
   -> handle IO by bfqq3

Fix the problem by checking bfqq is from merge chain fist. And this
might fix a following problem reported by our syzkaller(unreproducible):

The blamed change fixed another warning that is triggered when

been unregistered.

However, if the socket is just close()d without the 2nd connect(), the
remaining bo->bcm_proc_read triggers unnecessary remove_proc_entry()

Let's clear bo->bcm_proc_read after remove_proc_entry() in bcm_notify().

af_unix: Don't return OOB skb in manage_oob().

syzbot reported use-after-free in unix_stream_recv_urg(). [0]

The scenario is

  1. send(MSG_OOB)
  2. recv(MSG_OOB)
     -> The consumed OOB remains in recv queue
  3. send(MSG_OOB)
  4. recv()
     -> manage_oob() returns the next skb of the consumed OOB
     -> This is also OOB, but unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb is not cleared
  5. recv(MSG_OOB)
     -> unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb is used but already freed

The recent commit 8594d9b85c07 (""af_unix: Don't call skb_get() for OOB
skb."") uncovered the issue.

If the OOB skb is consumed and the next skb is peeked in manage_oob(),
we still need to check if the skb is OOB.

Let's do so by falling back to the following checks in manage_oob()
and add the test case in selftest.

Note that we need to add a similar check for SIOCATMARK.

wifi: wilc1000: fix potential RCU dereference issue in wilc_parse_join_bss_param

In the `wilc_parse_join_bss_param` function, the TSF field of the `ies`
structure is accessed after the RCU read-side critical section is
unlocked. According to RCU usage rules, this is illegal. Reusing this
pointer can lead to unpredictable behavior, including accessing memory
that has been updated or causing use-after-free issues.

This possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developed
by myself, specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues.

To address this, the TSF value is now stored in a local variable
`ies_tsf` before the RCU lock is released. The `param->tsf_lo` field is
then assigned using this local variable, ensuring that the TSF value is

This is a minimal userspace reproducer on a Raspberry Pi Zero W:

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <math.h>

    int main(void)
    {
            double v = 1.0;
            printf(""%fn"", NAN + *(volatile double *)&v);
            return 0;
    }

Another way to consistently trigger the oops is:

    calvin@raspberry-pi-zero-w ~$ python -c ""import json""

The bug reproduces only when the kernel is built with DYNAMIC_DEBUG=n,
because the pr_debug() calls act as barriers even when not activated.

This is the output from the same kernel source built with the same
compiler and DYNAMIC_DEBUG=y, where the userspace reproducer works as
expected:

    VFP: raising exceptions 30000000

    calvin@raspberry-pi-zero-w ~$ ./vfp-reproducer
    nan

Crudely grepping for vmsr/vmrs instructions in the otherwise nearly
idential text for vfp_support_entry() makes the problem obvious:

not zero-out PMU snapshot area from kvm_pmu_clear_snapshot_area() because
the guest is anyway being tore down.

The kvm_pmu_clear_snapshot_area() is also called when guest changes
PMU snapshot area of a VCPU but even in this case the previous PMU
snaphsot area must not be zeroed-out because the guest might have
reclaimed the pervious PMU snapshot area for some other purpose."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

drm/amd/display: Add null check for set_output_gamma in dcn30_set_output_transfer_func

This commit adds a null check for the set_output_gamma function pointer
in the  dcn30_set_output_transfer_func function. Previously,
set_output_gamma was being checked for nullity at line 386, but then it
was being dereferenced without any nullity check at line 401. This
could potentially lead to a null pointer dereference error if
set_output_gamma is indeed null.

To fix this, we now ensure that set_output_gamma is not null before
dereferencing it. We do this by adding a nullity check for
set_output_gamma before the call to set_output_gamma at line 401. If
set_output_gamma is null, we log an error message and do not call the
function.

This fix prevents a potential null pointer dereference error.

The reason is that ath11k_bcn_tx_status_event() will directly call might

sections. The call trace is like:

ath11k_bcn_tx_status_event()

-> rcu_read_unlock()

Commit 886433a98425 (""ath11k: add support for BSS color change"") added the

to avoid warning but also introduced this BUG.

Use work queue to avoid directly calling ath11k_mac_bcn_tx_event()
during RCU critical sections. No need to worry about the deletion of vif
because cancel_work_sync() will drop the work if it doesn't start or
block vif deletion until the running work is done.

For all non-tracing helpers which formerly had ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} as input

memory. For tracing, it is not needed given CAP_PERFMON can already read all
kernel memory anyway hence bpf_get_func_arg() and bpf_get_func_ret() is skipped
in here.

Also, the MTU helpers mtu_len pointer value is being written but also read.
Technically, the MEM_UNINIT should not be there in order to always force init.
Removing MEM_UNINIT needs more verifier rework though: MEM_UNINIT right now
implies two things actually: i) write into memory, ii) memory does not have
to be initialized. If we lift MEM_UNINIT, it then becomes: i) read into memory,
ii) memory must be initialized. This means that for bpf_*_check_mtu() we're
readding the issue we're trying to fix, that is, it would then be able to
write back into things like .rodata BPF maps. Follow-up work will rework the

Here, extent 0/1 are physically overlapped although it's entirely
_impossible_ for normal filesystem images generated by mkfs.

First, managed folios containing compressed data will be marked as
up-to-date and then unlocked immediately (unlike in-place folios) when
compressed I/Os are complete.  If physical blocks are not submitted in
the incremental order, there should be separate BIOs to avoid dependency
issues.  However, the current code mis-arranges z_erofs_fill_bio_vec()
and BIO submission which causes unexpected BIO waits.

Second, managed folios will be connected to their own pclusters for
efficient inter-queries.  However, this is somewhat hard to implement
easily if overlapped big pclusters exist.  Again, these only appear in
fuzzed images so let's simply fall back to temporary short-lived pages
for correctness.

Additionally, it justifies that referenced managed folios cannot be
truncated for now and reverts part of commit 2080ca1ed3e4 (""erofs: tidy
up `struct z_erofs_bvec`"") for simplicity although it shouldn't be any
difference."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

The F2FS ioctls for starting and committing atomic writes check for

Landlock an opportunity to deny the write access - if the caller's FSUID
matches the inode's UID, inode_owner_or_capable() immediately returns true.

There are scenarios where LSMs want to deny a process the ability to write
particular files, even files that the FSUID of the process owns; but this
can currently partially be bypassed using atomic write ioctls in two ways:

 - F2FS_IOC_START_ATOMIC_REPLACE + F2FS_IOC_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE can

btrfs: fix race setting file private on concurrent lseek using same fd

When doing concurrent lseek(2) system calls against the same file
descriptor, using multiple threads belonging to the same process, we have
a short time window where a race happens and can result in a memory leak.

The race happens like this:

1) A program opens a file descriptor for a file and then spawns two
   threads (with the pthreads library for example), lets call them
   task A and task B;

2) Task A calls lseek with SEEK_DATA or SEEK_HOLE and ends up at
   file.c:find_desired_extent() while holding a read lock on the inode;

3) At the start of find_desired_extent(), it extracts the file's
   private_data pointer into a local variable named 'private', which has
   a value of NULL;

4) Task B also calls lseek with SEEK_DATA or SEEK_HOLE, locks the inode
   in shared mode and enters file.c:find_desired_extent(), where it also
   extracts file->private_data into its local variable 'private', which
   has a NULL value;

5) Because it saw a NULL file private, task A allocates a private
   structure and assigns to the file structure;

6) Task B also saw a NULL file private so it also allocates its own file
   private and then assigns it to the same file structure, since both
   tasks are using the same file descriptor.

   At this point we leak the private structure allocated by task A.

Besides the memory leak, there's also the detail that both tasks end up
using the same cached state record in the private structure (struct
btrfs_file_private::llseek_cached_state), which can result in a
use-after-free problem since one task can free it while the other is
still using it (only one task took a reference count on it). Also, sharing
the cached state is not a good idea since it could result in incorrect
results in the future - right now it should not be a problem because it
end ups being used only in extent-io-tree.c:count_range_bits() where we do
range validation before using the cached state.

Fix this by protecting the private assignment and check of a file while
holding the inode's spinlock and keep track of the task that allocated
the private, so that it's used only by that task in order to prevent
user-after-free issues with the cached state record as well as potentially
using it incorrectly in the future."	7.0	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

firmware_loader: Block path traversal

Most firmware names are hardcoded strings, or are constructed from fairly
constrained format strings where the dynamic parts are just some hex
numbers or such.

However, there are a couple codepaths in the kernel where firmware file
names contain string components that are passed through from a device or
semi-privileged userspace; the ones I could find (not counting interfaces
that require root privileges) are:

 - lpfc_sli4_request_firmware_update() seems to construct the firmware
   filename from ""ModelName"", a string that was previously parsed out of
   some descriptor (""Vital Product Data"") in lpfc_fill_vpd()
 - nfp_net_fw_find() seems to construct a firmware filename from a model
   name coming from nfp_hwinfo_lookup(pf->hwinfo, ""nffw.partno""), which I
   think parses some descriptor that was read from the device.
   (But this case likely isn't exploitable because the format string looks
   like ""netronome/nic_%s"", and there shouldn't be any *folders* starting
   with ""netronome/nic_"". The previous case was different because there,
   the ""%s"" is *at the start* of the format string.)
 - module_flash_fw_schedule() is reachable from the
   ETHTOOL_MSG_MODULE_FW_FLASH_ACT netlink command, which is marked as
   GENL_UNS_ADMIN_PERM (meaning CAP_NET_ADMIN inside a user namespace is
   enough to pass the privilege check), and takes a userspace-provided
   firmware name.
   (But I think to reach this case, you need to have CAP_NET_ADMIN over a
   network namespace that a special kind of ethernet device is mapped into,
   so I think this is not a viable attack path in practice.)

Fix it by rejecting any firmware names containing "".."" path components.

CPU2 #3, and CPU2 #7 will wait on CPU1 #4 (if there's a writer, due to the
fairness of r/w semaphores).

8   sync(&kvm->srcu);

Note, there are likely more potential deadlocks in KVM x86, e.g. the same
pattern of taking cpu_hotplug_lock outside of kvm_lock likely exists with
__kvmclock_cpufreq_notifier():

  cpuhp_cpufreq_online()
  |
  -> cpufreq_online()
     |
     -> cpufreq_gov_performance_limits()
        |
        -> __cpufreq_driver_target()
           |
           -> __target_index()
              |
              -> cpufreq_freq_transition_begin()
                 |
                 -> cpufreq_notify_transition()
                    |
                    -> ... __kvmclock_cpufreq_notifier()

But, actually triggering such deadlocks is beyond rare due to the
combination of dependencies and timings involved.  E.g. the cpufreq
notifier is only used on older CPUs without a constant TSC, mucking with
the NX hugepage mitigation while VMs are running is very uncommon, and
doing so while also onlining/offlining a CPU (necessary to generate
contention on cpu_hotplug_lock) would be even more unusual.

The most robust solution to the general cpu_hotplug_lock issue is likely
to switch vm_list to be an RCU-protected list, e.g. so that x86's cpufreq
notifier doesn't to take kvm_lock.  For now, settle for fixing the most
blatant deadlock, as switching to an RCU-protected list is a much more
involved change, but add a comment in locking.rst to call out that care
needs to be taken when walking holding kvm_lock and walking vm_list.

bpf: Fix helper writes to read-only maps

Lonial found an issue that despite user- and BPF-side frozen BPF map
(like in case of .rodata), it was still possible to write into it from
a BPF program side through specific helpers having ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT}
as arguments.

In check_func_arg() when the argument is as mentioned, the meta->raw_mode
is never set. Later, check_helper_mem_access(), under the case of
PTR_TO_MAP_VALUE as register base type, it assumes BPF_READ for the
subsequent call to check_map_access_type() and given the BPF map is
read-only it succeeds.

The helpers really need to be annotated as ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} | MEM_UNINIT
when results are written into them as opposed to read out of them. The
latter indicates that it's okay to pass a pointer to uninitialized memory
as the memory is written to anyway.

However, ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} is a special case of ARG_PTR_TO_FIXED_SIZE_MEM
just with additional alignment requirement. So it is better to just get
rid of the ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} special cases altogether and reuse the
fixed size memory types. For this, add MEM_ALIGNED to additionally ensure
alignment given these helpers write directly into the args via *<ptr> = val.
The .arg*_size has been initialized reflecting the actual sizeof(*<ptr>).

MEM_ALIGNED can only be used in combination with MEM_FIXED_SIZE annotated
argument types, since in !MEM_FIXED_SIZE cases the verifier does not know
the buffer size a priori and therefore cannot blindly write *<ptr> = val."	7.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H

Prior to versions 5.0.1, 4.0.4, and 3.8.1, however, `loadCompressedPublicKey` is missing that check. That allows the attacker to use public keys on low-cardinality curves to extract enough information to fully restore the private key from as little as 11 ECDH sessions, and very cheaply on compute power. Other operations on public keys are also affected, including e.g. `publicKeyVerify()` incorrectly returning `true` on those invalid keys, and e.g. `publicKeyTweakMul()` also returning predictable outcomes allowing to restore the tweak.

Since commit 3f8ca2e115e5 (""vhost/scsi: Extract common handling code

triggered when guest sends an SCSI AN request.

In vhost_scsi_ctl_handle_vq(), `vc.target` is assigned with

vhost_scsi_get_req() which extracts `vc->req` and `tpg`. However, for

set to NULL in this branch. Later, in vhost_scsi_get_req(),
`vc->target` is dereferenced without being checked, leading to a null
pointer dereference bug. This bug can be triggered from guest.

When this bug occurs, the vhost_worker process is killed while holding

After tracing the scheduling event, it was discovered that the migration
of the ""timerlat/1"" thread was performed during thread creation. Further
analysis confirmed that it is because the CPU online processing for
osnoise is implemented through workers, which is asynchronous with the
offline processing. When the worker was scheduled to create a thread, the
CPU may has already been removed from the cpu_online_mask during the offline
process, resulting in the inability to select the right CPU:

T1                       | T2

CVE-2024-49867	2024-10-21T18:15:06.403	2024-11-08T16:15:29.037	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: wait for fixup workers before stopping cleaner kthread during umount

During unmount, at close_ctree(), we have the following steps in this order:

1) Park the cleaner kthread - this doesn't destroy the kthread, it basically
   halts its execution (wake ups against it work but do nothing);

2) We stop the cleaner kthread - this results in freeing the respective
   struct task_struct;

3) We call btrfs_stop_all_workers() which waits for any jobs running in all
   the work queues and then free the work queues.

Syzbot reported a case where a fixup worker resulted in a crash when doing
a delayed iput on its inode while attempting to wake up the cleaner at
btrfs_add_delayed_iput(), because the task_struct of the cleaner kthread
was already freed. This can happen during unmount because we don't wait
for any fixup workers still running before we call kthread_stop() against
the cleaner kthread, which stops and free all its resources.

Fix this by waiting for any fixup workers at close_ctree() before we call
kthread_stop() against the cleaner and run pending delayed iputs.

The stack traces reported by syzbot were the following:

[CAUSE]
The allocation failure happens at the start_transaction() inside
prepare_to_relocate(), and during the error handling we call
unset_reloc_control(), which makes fs_info->balance_ctl to be NULL.

Then we continue the error path cleanup in btrfs_balance() by calling
reset_balance_state() which will call del_balance_item() to fully delete
the balance item in the root tree.

However during the small window between set_reloc_contrl() and
unset_reloc_control(), we can have a subvolume tree update and created a
reloc_root for that subvolume.

Then we go into the final btrfs_commit_transaction() of
del_balance_item(), and into btrfs_update_reloc_root() inside
commit_fs_roots().

That function checks if fs_info->reloc_ctl is in the merge_reloc_tree
stage, but since fs_info->reloc_ctl is NULL, it results a NULL pointer
dereference.

[FIX]
Just add extra check on fs_info->reloc_ctl inside
btrfs_update_reloc_root(), before checking
fs_info->reloc_ctl->merge_reloc_tree.

That DEAD_RELOC_TREE handling is to prevent further modification to the
reloc tree during merge stage, but since there is no reloc_ctl at all,
we do not need to bother that."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Fix this by not storing the NUL string terminator since we don't actually
need it for name cache entries, this way ""name_len"" corresponds to the
actual size of the ""name"" array. This requires marking the ""name"" array
field with __nonstring and using memcpy() instead of strcpy() as
recommended by the guidelines at:

Patch series ""memfd-pin huge page fixes"".

Fix multiple bugs that occur when using memfd_pin_folios with hugetlb
pages and THP.  The hugetlb bugs only bite when the page is not yet
faulted in when memfd_pin_folios is called.  The THP bug bites when the
starting offset passed to memfd_pin_folios is not huge page aligned.  See
the commit messages for details.


This patch (of 5):

memfd_pin_folios on memory backed by THP panics if the requested start
offset is not huge page aligned:

BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000036
RIP: 0010:filemap_get_folios_contig+0xdf/0x290

The fault occurs here, because xas_load returns a folio with value 2:

    filemap_get_folios_contig()
        for (folio = xas_load(&xas); folio && xas.xa_index <= end;
                        folio = xas_next(&xas)) {
                ...
                if (!folio_try_get(folio))   <-- BOOM

""2"" is an xarray sibling entry.  We get it because memfd_pin_folios does
not round the indices passed to filemap_get_folios_contig to huge page
boundaries for THP, so we load from the middle of a huge page range see a
sibling.  (It does round for hugetlbfs, at the is_file_hugepages test).

To fix, if the folio is a sibling, then return the next index as the
starting point for the next call to filemap_get_folios_contig."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

We currently do stuff like queuing the final destruction step on a
random system wq, which will outlive the driver instance. With bad

being alive leading to various UAF splats. Add a fini step to ensure
user queues are properly torn down. At this point GuC should already be

resource: fix region_intersects() vs add_memory_driver_managed()

On a system with CXL memory, the resource tree (/proc/iomem) related to
CXL memory may look like something as follows.

490000000-50fffffff : CXL Window 0
  490000000-50fffffff : region0
    490000000-50fffffff : dax0.0
      490000000-50fffffff : System RAM (kmem)

Because drivers/dax/kmem.c calls add_memory_driver_managed() during
onlining CXL memory, which makes ""System RAM (kmem)"" a descendant of ""CXL
Window X"".  This confuses region_intersects(), which expects all ""System
RAM"" resources to be at the top level of iomem_resource.  This can lead to
bugs.

For example, when the following command line is executed to write some
memory in CXL memory range via /dev/mem,

 $ dd if=data of=/dev/mem bs=$((1 << 10)) seek=$((0x490000000 >> 10)) count=1
 dd: error writing '/dev/mem': Bad address
 1+0 records in
 0+0 records out
 0 bytes copied, 0.0283507 s, 0.0 kB/s

the command fails as expected.  However, the error code is wrong.  It
should be ""Operation not permitted"" instead of ""Bad address"".  More
seriously, the /dev/mem permission checking in devmem_is_allowed() passes
incorrectly.  Although the accessing is prevented later because ioremap()
isn't allowed to map system RAM, it is a potential security issue.  During
command executing, the following warning is reported in the kernel log for
calling ioremap() on system RAM.

 ioremap on RAM at 0x0000000490000000 - 0x0000000490000fff

The details of command execution process are as follows.  In the above
resource tree, ""System RAM"" is a descendant of ""CXL Window 0"" instead of a
top level resource.  So, region_intersects() will report no System RAM
resources in the CXL memory region incorrectly, because it only checks the
top level resources.  Consequently, devmem_is_allowed() will return 1
(allow access via /dev/mem) for CXL memory region incorrectly. 
Fortunately, ioremap() doesn't allow to map System RAM and reject the
access.

So, region_intersects() needs to be fixed to work correctly with the
resource tree with ""System RAM"" not at top level as above.  To fix it, if
we found a unmatched resource in the top level, we will continue to search
matched resources in its descendant resources.  So, we will not miss any
matched resources in resource tree anymore.

In the new implementation, an example resource tree

|------------- ""CXL Window 0"" ------------|
|-- ""System RAM"" --|

will behave similar as the following fake resource tree for
region_intersects(, IORESOURCE_SYSTEM_RAM, ),

|-- ""System RAM"" --||-- ""CXL Window 0a"" --|

While reviewing the patch, Honza found that when adjusting resize_bg in
alloc_flex_gd(), it was possible for flex_gd->resize_bg to be bigger than
flexbg_size.

The reproduction of the problem requires the following:

 o_group = flexbg_size * 2 * n;
 o_size = (o_group + 1) * group_size;
 n_group: [o_group + flexbg_size, o_group + flexbg_size * 2)
 o_size = (n_group + 1) * group_size;

Take n=0,flexbg_size=16 as an example:

              last:15
|o---------------|--------------n-|
o_group:0    resize to      n_group:30

The corresponding reproducer is:

img=test.img
rm -f $img
truncate -s 600M $img
mkfs.ext4 -F $img -b 1024 -G 16 8M
dev=`losetup -f --show $img`
mkdir -p /tmp/test
mount $dev /tmp/test
resize2fs $dev 248M

Delete the problematic plus 1 to fix the issue, and add a WARN_ON_ONCE()
to prevent the issue from happening again.

The flow of issue triggering is as follows:

ext4_split_extent_at
  path = *ppath
  ext4_ext_insert_extent(ppath)
    ext4_ext_create_new_leaf(ppath)
      ext4_find_extent(orig_path)
        path = *orig_path
        read_extent_tree_block
          // return -ENOMEM or -EIO
        ext4_free_ext_path(path)
          kfree(path)
        *orig_path = NULL
  a. If err is -ENOMEM:
  ext4_ext_dirty(path + path->p_depth)
  // path use-after-free !!!
  b. If err is -EIO and we have EXT_DEBUG defined:
  ext4_ext_show_leaf(path)
    eh = path[depth].p_hdr
    // path also use-after-free !!!

So when trying to zeroout or fix the extent length, call ext4_find_extent()
to update the path.

In addition we use *ppath directly as an ext4_ext_show_leaf() input to
avoid possible use-after-free when EXT_DEBUG is defined, and to avoid
unnecessary path updates."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

mm, slub: avoid zeroing kmalloc redzone

Since commit 946fa0dbf2d8 (""mm/slub: extend redzone check to extra
allocated kmalloc space than requested""), setting orig_size treats
the wasted space (object_size - orig_size) as a redzone. However with
init_on_free=1 we clear the full object->size, including the redzone.

Additionally we clear the object metadata, including the stored orig_size,
making it zero, which makes check_object() treat the whole object as a
redzone.

These issues lead to the following BUG report with ""slub_debug=FUZ

To address the issue, use orig_size to clear the used area. And restore
the value of orig_size after clear the remaining area.

When CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG not defined, (get_orig_size()' directly returns
s->object_size. So when using memset to init the area, the size can simply
be orig_size, as orig_size returns object_size when CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG not
enabled. And orig_size can never be bigger than object_size."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-49888	2024-10-21T18:15:11.443	2024-11-13T14:54:25.787	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix a sdiv overflow issue

Zac Ecob reported a problem where a bpf program may cause kernel crash due
to the following error:
  Oops: divide error: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN PTI

The failure is due to the below signed divide:
  LLONG_MIN/-1 where LLONG_MIN equals to -9,223,372,036,854,775,808.
LLONG_MIN/-1 is supposed to give a positive number 9,223,372,036,854,775,808,
but it is impossible since for 64-bit system, the maximum positive
number is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. On x86_64, LLONG_MIN/-1 will
cause a kernel exception. On arm64, the result for LLONG_MIN/-1 is
LLONG_MIN.

Further investigation found all the following sdiv/smod cases may trigger
an exception when bpf program is running on x86_64 platform:
  - LLONG_MIN/-1 for 64bit operation
  - INT_MIN/-1 for 32bit operation
  - LLONG_MIN%-1 for 64bit operation
  - INT_MIN%-1 for 32bit operation
where -1 can be an immediate or in a register.

On arm64, there are no exceptions:
  - LLONG_MIN/-1 = LLONG_MIN
  - INT_MIN/-1 = INT_MIN
  - LLONG_MIN%-1 = 0
  - INT_MIN%-1 = 0
where -1 can be an immediate or in a register.

Insn patching is needed to handle the above cases and the patched codes
produced results aligned with above arm64 result. The below are pseudo
codes to handle sdiv/smod exceptions including both divisor -1 and divisor 0
and the divisor is stored in a register.

sdiv:
      tmp = rX

ext4: avoid use-after-free in ext4_ext_show_leaf()

In ext4_find_extent(), path may be freed by error or be reallocated, so

use-after-free, as follows:

ext4_ext_show_leaf(). Fix a spelling error by the way.

the IO/APIC. But that code does not require to handle interrupt allocation
failures. If the interrupt cannot be allocated then timer delivery fails
and it either panics due to that or falls back to legacy mode.

Previously, some sanity check have been done in dump_mapping() before
the print facility parsing '%pd' though, it's still possible to run into
an invalid dentry.d_name.name.

Since dump_mapping() only needs to dump the filename only, retrieve it
by itself in a safer way to prevent an unnecessary crash.

Note that either retrieving the filename with '%pd' or
strncpy_from_kernel_nofault(), the filename could be unreliable."	4.6	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

wifi: ath9k_htc: Use __skb_set_length() for resetting urb before resubmit

Syzbot points out that skb_trim() has a sanity check on the existing length of
the skb, which can be uninitialised in some error paths. The intent here is
clearly just to reset the length to zero before resubmitting, so switch to
calling __skb_set_length(skb, 0) directly. In addition, __skb_set_length()
already contains a call to skb_reset_tail_pointer(), so remove the redundant
call.

The syzbot report came from ath9k_hif_usb_reg_in_cb(), but there's a similar
usage of skb_trim() in ath9k_hif_usb_rx_cb(), change both while we're at it."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

If SER L2 occurs during the WoWLAN resume flow, the add interface flow

l2tp: prevent possible tunnel refcount underflow

When a session is created, it sets a backpointer to its tunnel. When
the session refcount drops to 0, l2tp_session_free drops the tunnel
refcount if session->tunnel is non-NULL. However, session->tunnel is
set in l2tp_session_create, before the tunnel refcount is incremented
by l2tp_session_register, which leaves a small window where
session->tunnel is non-NULL when the tunnel refcount hasn't been
bumped.

Moving the assignment to l2tp_session_register is trivial but
l2tp_session_create calls l2tp_session_set_header_len which uses
session->tunnel to get the tunnel's encap. Add an encap arg to
l2tp_session_set_header_len to avoid using session->tunnel.

If l2tpv3 sessions have colliding IDs, it is possible for
l2tp_v3_session_get to race with l2tp_session_register and fetch a
session which doesn't yet have session->tunnel set. Add a check for
this case."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

In `gpiod_get_label()`, it is possible that `srcu_dereference_check()` may

without verifying if `label` itself is NULL.

This patch adds a proper NULL check for `label` before accessing
`label->str`. The check for `label->str != NULL` is removed because
`label->str` can never be NULL if `label` is not NULL.

This fixes the issue where the label name was being printed as `(efault)`

net: test for not too small csum_start in virtio_net_hdr_to_skb()

syzbot was able to trigger this warning [1], after injecting a
malicious packet through af_packet, setting skb->csum_start and thus
the transport header to an incorrect value.

We can at least make sure the transport header is after
the end of the network header (with a estimated minimal size).

net: add more sanity checks to qdisc_pkt_len_init()

One path takes care of SKB_GSO_DODGY, assuming
skb->len is bigger than hdr_len.

virtio_net_hdr_to_skb() does not fully dissect TCP headers,
it only make sure it is at least 20 bytes.

It is possible for an user to provide a malicious 'GSO' packet,
total length of 80 bytes.

- 20 bytes of IPv4 header
- 60 bytes TCP header
- a small gso_size like 8

virtio_net_hdr_to_skb() would declare this packet as a normal
GSO packet, because it would see 40 bytes of payload,
bigger than gso_size.

We need to make detect this case to not underflow

CVE-2024-49949	2024-10-21T18:15:16.323	2024-11-12T21:03:59.377	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: avoid potential underflow in qdisc_pkt_len_init() with UFO

After commit 7c6d2ecbda83 (""net: be more gentle about silly gso
requests coming from user"") virtio_net_hdr_to_skb() had sanity check
to detect malicious attempts from user space to cook a bad GSO packet.

Then commit cf9acc90c80ec (""net: virtio_net_hdr_to_skb: count
transport header in UFO"") while fixing one issue, allowed user space
to cook a GSO packet with the following characteristic :

IPv4 SKB_GSO_UDP, gso_size=3, skb->len = 28.

When this packet arrives in qdisc_pkt_len_init(), we end up
with hdr_len = 28 (IPv4 header + UDP header), matching skb->len

Then the following sets gso_segs to 0 :

gso_segs = DIV_ROUND_UP(skb->len - hdr_len,
                        shinfo->gso_size);

Then later we set qdisc_skb_cb(skb)->pkt_len to back to zero :/

qdisc_skb_cb(skb)->pkt_len += (gso_segs - 1) * hdr_len;

This leads to the following crash in fq_codel [1]

qdisc_pkt_len_init() is best effort, we only want an estimation
of the bytes sent on the wire, not crashing the kernel.

This patch is fixing this particular issue, a following one
adds more sanity checks for another potential bug.

The issue was in the reflink workfow while reserving space for inline
xattr.  The problematic function is ocfs2_reflink_xattr_inline().  By the
time this function is called the reflink tree is already recreated at the
destination inode from the source inode.  At this point, this function
reserves space for inline xattrs at the destination inode without even
checking if there is space at the root metadata block.  It simply reduces
the l_count from 243 to 227 thereby making space of 256 bytes for inline
xattr whereas the inode already has extents beyond this index (in this
case up to 230), thereby causing corruption.

The fix for this is to reserve space for inline metadata at the destination
inode before the reflink tree gets recreated. The customer has verified the
fix."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

During noirq suspend phase the Raspberry Pi power driver suffer of

This commit addresses a potential index out of bounds issue in the
`cm3_helper_translate_curve_to_hw_format` function in the DCN30 color

number of transfer function points (TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS).

The fix adds a check to ensure 'i' is within bounds before accessing the
transfer function points. If 'i' is out of bounds, the function returns
false to indicate an error.

Nothing appears to limit the number of concurrent async COPY
operations that clients can start. In addition, AFAICT each async
COPY can copy an unlimited number of 4MB chunks, so can run for a
long time. Thus IMO async COPY can become a DoS vector.

Add a restriction mechanism that bounds the number of concurrent
background COPY operations. Start simple and try to be fair -- this
patch implements a per-namespace limit.

An async COPY request that occurs while this limit is exceeded gets

For fixing CVE-2023-6270, f98364e92662 (""aoe: fix the potential

net: dsa: improve shutdown sequence

Alexander Sverdlin presents 2 problems during shutdown with the
lan9303 driver. One is specific to lan9303 and the other just happens
to reproduce there.

The first problem is that lan9303 is unique among DSA drivers in that it
calls dev_get_drvdata() at ""arbitrary runtime"" (not probe, not shutdown,
not remove):

phy_state_machine()
-> ...
   -> dsa_user_phy_read()
      -> ds->ops->phy_read()
         -> lan9303_phy_read()
            -> chip->ops->phy_read()
               -> lan9303_mdio_phy_read()
                  -> dev_get_drvdata()

But we never stop the phy_state_machine(), so it may continue to run
after dsa_switch_shutdown(). Our common pattern in all DSA drivers is
to set drvdata to NULL to suppress the remove() method that may come
afterwards. But in this case it will result in an NPD.

The second problem is that the way in which we set
dp->conduit->dsa_ptr = NULL; is concurrent with receive packet
processing. dsa_switch_rcv() checks once whether dev->dsa_ptr is NULL,
but afterwards, rather than continuing to use that non-NULL value,
dev->dsa_ptr is dereferenced again and again without NULL checks:
dsa_conduit_find_user() and many other places. In between dereferences,
there is no locking to ensure that what was valid once continues to be
valid.

Both problems have the common aspect that closing the conduit interface
solves them.

In the first case, dev_close(conduit) triggers the NETDEV_GOING_DOWN
event in dsa_user_netdevice_event() which closes user ports as well.
dsa_port_disable_rt() calls phylink_stop(), which synchronously stops
the phylink state machine, and ds->ops->phy_read() will thus no longer
call into the driver after this point.

In the second case, dev_close(conduit) should do this, as per
Documentation/networking/driver.rst:

| Quiescence
| ----------
|
| After the ndo_stop routine has been called, the hardware must
| not receive or transmit any data.  All in flight packets must
| be aborted. If necessary, poll or wait for completion of
| any reset commands.

So it should be sufficient to ensure that later, when we zeroize
conduit->dsa_ptr, there will be no concurrent dsa_switch_rcv() call
on this conduit.

The addition of the netif_device_detach() function is to ensure that
ioctls, rtnetlinks and ethtool requests on the user ports no longer
propagate down to the driver - we're no longer prepared to handle them.

The race condition actually did not exist when commit 0650bf52b31f
(""net: dsa: be compatible with masters which unregister on shutdown"")
first introduced dsa_switch_shutdown(). It was created later, when we
stopped unregistering the user interfaces from a bad spot, and we just
replaced that sequence with a racy zeroization of conduit->dsa_ptr
(one which doesn't ensure that the interfaces aren't up)."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

driver just can't allocate more memory for page tables. While the code

static_call: Handle module init failure correctly in static_call_del_module()

Module insertion invokes static_call_add_module() to initialize the static
calls in a module. static_call_add_module() invokes __static_call_init(),
which allocates a struct static_call_mod to either encapsulate the built-in
static call sites of the associated key into it so further modules can be
added or to append the module to the module chain.

If that allocation fails the function returns with an error code and the
module core invokes static_call_del_module() to clean up eventually added
static_call_mod entries.

This works correctly, when all keys used by the module were converted over
to a module chain before the failure. If not then static_call_del_module()
causes a #GP as it blindly assumes that key::mods points to a valid struct
static_call_mod.

The problem is that key::mods is not a individual struct member of struct
static_call_key, it's part of a union to save space:

        union {
                /* bit 0: 0 = mods, 1 = sites */
                unsigned long type;
                struct static_call_mod *mods;
                struct static_call_site *sites;
	};

key::sites is a pointer to the list of built-in usage sites of the static
call. The type of the pointer is differentiated by bit 0. A mods pointer
has the bit clear, the sites pointer has the bit set.

As static_call_del_module() blidly assumes that the pointer is a valid
static_call_mod type, it fails to check for this failure case and
dereferences the pointer to the list of built-in call sites, which is
obviously bogus.

Cure it by checking whether the key has a sites or a mods pointer.

If it's a sites pointer then the key is not to be touched. As the sites are
walked in the same order as in __static_call_init() the site walk can be
terminated because all subsequent sites have not been touched by the init
code due to the error exit.

If it was converted before the allocation fail, then the inner loop which
searches for a module match will find nothing.

A fail in the second allocation in __static_call_init() is harmless and
does not require special treatment. The first allocation succeeded and
converted the key to a module chain. That first entry has mod::mod == NULL

neither find a module match nor a module chain. The next site in the walk

Note that a rule specifying `toEntities: world` or `toEntities: 0.0.0.0/0` is insufficient, it must be to entity `all`.This issue has been patched in Cilium v1.14.16 and v1.15.10. As this issue only affects policies using `enableDefaultDeny: false` or that set `toEntities` to `all`, some workarounds are available.

mac802154: Fix potential RCU dereference issue in mac802154_scan_worker

In the `mac802154_scan_worker` function, the `scan_req->type` field was
accessed after the RCU read-side critical section was unlocked. According
to RCU usage rules, this is illegal and can lead to unpredictable
behavior, such as accessing memory that has been updated or causing
use-after-free issues.

This possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developed
by myself, specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues.

To address this, the `scan_req->type` value is now stored in a local
variable `scan_req_type` while still within the RCU read-side critical
section. The `scan_req_type` is then used after the RCU lock is released,

ext4: fix i_data_sem unlock order in ext4_ind_migrate()

Fuzzing reports a possible deadlock in jbd2_log_wait_commit.

This issue is triggered when an EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE ioctl is set to require
synchronous updates because the file descriptor is opened with O_SYNC.
This can lead to the jbd2_journal_stop() function calling
jbd2_might_wait_for_commit(), potentially causing a deadlock if the
EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE call races with a write(2) system call.

This problem only arises when CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING is enabled. In this
case, the jbd2_might_wait_for_commit macro locks jbd2_handle in the
jbd2_journal_stop function while i_data_sem is locked. This triggers
lockdep because the jbd2_journal_start function might also lock the same
jbd2_handle simultaneously.

Both i_mode and noexec checks wrapped in WARN_ON stem from an artifact

633fb6ac3980 (""exec: move S_ISREG() check earlier"")
0fd338b2d2cd (""exec: move path_noexec() check earlier"")

Instead of being removed said checks are WARN_ON'ed instead, which
has some debug value.

However, the spurious path_noexec check is racy, resulting in
unwarranted warnings should someone race with setting the noexec flag.

One can note there is more to perm-checking whether execve is allowed
and none of the conditions are guaranteed to still hold after they were
tested for.

Additionally this does not validate whether the code path did any perm
checking to begin with -- it will pass if the inode happens to be
regular.

Keep the redundant path_noexec() check even though it's mindless
nonsense checking for guarantee that isn't given so drop the WARN.

When ident_pud_init() uses only GB pages to create identity maps, large

address space past that requested, including areas marked reserved by the
BIOS.  That allows processor speculation into reserved regions, that on UV
systems can cause system halts.

Only use GB pages when map creation requests include the full GB page of
space.  Fall back to using smaller 2M pages when only portions of a GB page
are included in the request.

No attempt is made to coalesce mapping requests. If a request requires a
map entry at the 2M (pmd) level, subsequent mapping requests within the
same 1G region will also be at the pmd level, even if adjacent or
overlapping such requests could have been combined to map a full GB page.

event is free()'d. There are two related but distinct cases:

 - the task_work was already queued before destroying the event;
 - destroying the event itself queues the task_work.

The first cannot be solved using task_work_cancel() since
perf_release() itself might be called from a task_work (____fput),
which means the current->task_works list is already empty and
task_work_cancel() won't be able to find the perf_pending_task()
entry.

The simplest alternative is extending the perf_event lifetime to cover
the task_work.

The second is just silly, queueing a task_work while you know the
event is going away makes no sense and is easily avoided by
re-arranging how the event is marked STATE_DEAD and ensuring it goes
through STATE_OFF on the way down."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Current driver is missing a sentinel in the struct soc_device_attribute

This was only exposed once the CONFIG_SOC_MT7621 mt7621 soc_dev_attr

rtc: cmos: Fix event handler registration ordering issue

Because acpi_install_fixed_event_handler() enables the event
automatically on success, it is incorrect to call it before the
handler routine passed to it is ready to handle events.

Unfortunately, the rtc-cmos driver does exactly the incorrect thing
by calling cmos_wake_setup(), which passes rtc_handler() to
acpi_install_fixed_event_handler(), before cmos_do_probe(), because
rtc_handler() uses dev_get_drvdata() to get to the cmos object
pointer and the driver data pointer is only populated in
cmos_do_probe().

This leads to a NULL pointer dereference in rtc_handler() on boot
if the RTC fixed event happens to be active at the init time.

To address this issue, change the initialization ordering of the
driver so that cmos_wake_setup() is always called after a successful
cmos_do_probe() call.

While at it, change cmos_pnp_probe() to call cmos_do_probe() after
the initial if () statement used for computing the IRQ argument to
be passed to cmos_do_probe() which is cleaner than calling it in
each branch of that if () (local variable ""irq"" can be of type int,
because it is passed to that function as an argument of type int).

Note that commit 6492fed7d8c9 (""rtc: rtc-cmos: Do not check
ACPI_FADT_LOW_POWER_S0"") caused this issue to affect a larger number
of systems, because previously it only affected systems with
ACPI_FADT_LOW_POWER_S0 set, but it is present regardless of that

gpiolib: fix memory leak in gpiochip_setup_dev()

gcdev_register() & gcdev_unregister() would call device_add() &
device_del() (no matter CONFIG_GPIO_CDEV is enabled or not) to
register/unregister device.

However, if device_add() succeeds, some resource (like
struct device_private allocated by device_private_init())
is not released by device_del().

Therefore, after device_add() succeeds by gcdev_register(), it
needs to call put_device() to release resource in the error handle
path.

Here we move forward the register of release function, and let it
release every piece of resource by put_device() instead of kfree().

While at it, fix another subtle issue, i.e. when gc->ngpio is equal
to 0, we still call kcalloc() and, in case of further error, kfree()
on the ZERO_PTR pointer, which is not NULL. It's not a bug per se,

If the size of the integer (unsigned n) is bigger than 32 in snto32(),
shift exponent will be too large for 32-bit type 'int', resulting in a
shift-out-of-bounds bug.
Fix this by adding a check on the size of the integer (unsigned n) in
snto32(). To add support for n greater than 32 bits, set n to 32, if n
is greater than 32."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

net: dsa: sja1105: avoid out of bounds access in sja1105_init_l2_policing()

The SJA1105 family has 45 L2 policing table entries
(SJA1105_MAX_L2_POLICING_COUNT) and SJA1110 has 110
(SJA1110_MAX_L2_POLICING_COUNT). Keeping the table structure but
accounting for the difference in port count (5 in SJA1105 vs 10 in
SJA1110) does not fully explain the difference. Rather, the SJA1110 also
has L2 ingress policers for multicast traffic. If a packet is classified
as multicast, it will be processed by the policer index 99 + SRCPORT.

The sja1105_init_l2_policing() function initializes all L2 policers such
that they don't interfere with normal packet reception by default. To have
a common code between SJA1105 and SJA1110, the index of the multicast
policer for the port is calculated because it's an index that is out of
bounds for SJA1105 but in bounds for SJA1110, and a bounds check is
performed.

The code fails to do the proper thing when determining what to do with the
multicast policer of port 0 on SJA1105 (ds->num_ports = 5). The ""mcast""
index will be equal to 45, which is also equal to
table->ops->max_entry_count (SJA1105_MAX_L2_POLICING_COUNT). So it passes
through the check. But at the same time, SJA1105 doesn't have multicast
policers. So the code programs the SHARINDX field of an out-of-bounds
element in the L2 Policing table of the static config.

The comparison between index 45 and 45 entries should have determined the
code to not access this policer index on SJA1105, since its memory wasn't
even allocated.

With enough bad luck, the out-of-bounds write could even overwrite other
valid kernel data, but in this case, the issue was detected using KASAN.

 Kernel panic - not syncing: panic_on_warn set ...

This happens because the adding of task_work from io_ring_exit_work()
isn't synchronized with canceling all work items from eg exec. The
execution of the two are ordered in that they are both run by the task
itself, but if io_tctx_exit_cb() is queued while we're canceling all
work items off exec AND gets executed when the task exits to userspace
rather than in the main loop in io_uring_cancel_generic(), then we can
find current->io_uring == NULL and hit the above crash.

It's safe to add this NULL check here, because the execution of the two
paths are done by the task itself.

Apparently, the slcan's tx_work is freed while being scheduled. While
slcan_netdev_close() (netdev side) calls flush_work(&sl->tx_work),
slcan_close() (tty side) does not. So when the netdev is never set UP,
but the tty is stuffed with bytes and forced to wakeup write, the work
is scheduled, but never flushed.

So add an additional flush_work() to slcan_close() to be sure the work
is flushed under all circumstances.

The Fixes commit below moved flush_work() from slcan_close() to
slcan_netdev_close(). What was the rationale behind it? Maybe we can
drop the one in slcan_netdev_close()?

To fix this issue, save the per-CQ work_done variable in a local variable

Sanity checks were added to verify the v4l2_bt_timings blanking fields
in order to avoid integer overflows when userspace passes weird values.

But that assumed that userspace would correctly fill in the front porch,
backporch and sync values, but sometimes all you know is the total
blanking, which is then assigned to just one of these fields.

And that can fail with these checks.

So instead set a maximum for the total horizontal and vertical
blanking and check that each field remains below that.

That is still sufficient to avoid integer overflows, but it also
allows for more flexibility in how userspace fills in these fields."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

memcg: fix possible use-after-free in memcg_write_event_control()

memcg_write_event_control() accesses the dentry->d_name of the specified
control fd to route the write call.  As a cgroup interface file can't be
renamed, it's safe to access d_name as long as the specified file is a
regular cgroup file.  Also, as these cgroup interface files can't be
removed before the directory, it's safe to access the parent too.

Prior to 347c4a874710 (""memcg: remove cgroup_event->cft""), there was a
call to __file_cft() which verified that the specified file is a regular
cgroupfs file before further accesses.  The cftype pointer returned from
__file_cft() was no longer necessary and the commit inadvertently dropped
the file type check with it allowing any file to slip through.  With the
invarients broken, the d_name and parent accesses can now race against
renames and removals of arbitrary files and cause use-after-free's.

Fix the bug by resurrecting the file type check in __file_cft().  Now that
cgroupfs is implemented through kernfs, checking the file operations needs
to go through a layer of indirection.  Instead, let's check the superblock

fscache: Fix oops due to race with cookie_lru and use_cookie

If a cookie expires from the LRU and the LRU_DISCARD flag is set, but
the state machine has not run yet, it's possible another thread can call
fscache_use_cookie and begin to use it.

When the cookie_worker finally runs, it will see the LRU_DISCARD flag
set, transition the cookie->state to LRU_DISCARDING, which will then
withdraw the cookie.  Once the cookie is withdrawn the object is removed
the below oops will occur because the object associated with the cookie
is now NULL.

Fix the oops by clearing the LRU_DISCARD bit if another thread uses the
cookie before the cookie_worker runs.

This is a tentative to write above the stack. The problem is encoutered
with tests added by commit 38608ee7b690 (""bpf, tests: Add load store
test case for tail call"")

This happens because tail call is done to a BPF prog with a different
stack_depth. At the time being, the stack is kept as is when the caller
tail calls its callee. But at exit, the callee restores the stack based
on its own properties. Therefore here, at each run, r1 is erroneously
increased by 32 - 16 = 16 bytes.

This was done that way in order to pass the tail call count from caller
to callee through the stack. As powerpc32 doesn't have a red zone in
the stack, it was necessary the maintain the stack as is for the tail
call. But it was not anticipated that the BPF frame size could be
different.

Let's take a new approach. Use register r4 to carry the tail call count
during the tail call, and save it into the stack at function entry if
required. This means the input parameter must be in r3, which is more
correct as it is a 32 bits parameter, then tail call better match with
normal BPF function entry, the down side being that we move that input
parameter back and forth between r3 and r4. That can be optimised later.

Doing that also has the advantage of maximising the common parts between
tail calls and a normal function exit.

With the fix, tail call tests are now successfull:

pci_get_device() says that it will increase the reference count for the
returned pci_dev and also decrease the reference count for the input
pci_dev @from if it is not NULL.

If we break for_each_pci_dev() loop with pdev not NULL, we need to call
pci_dev_put() to decrease the reference count. Add the missing
pci_dev_put() for the error path to avoid reference count leak."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2022-49003	2024-10-21T20:15:11.920	2024-10-25T14:12:59.897	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme: fix SRCU protection of nvme_ns_head list

Walking the nvme_ns_head siblings list is protected by the head's srcu
in nvme_ns_head_submit_bio() but not nvme_mpath_revalidate_paths().
Removing namespaces from the list also fails to synchronize the srcu.
Concurrent scan work can therefore cause use-after-frees.

Hold the head's srcu lock in nvme_mpath_revalidate_paths() and
synchronize with the srcu, not the global RCU, in nvme_ns_remove().

Observed the following panic when making NVMe/RDMA connections
with native multipath on the Rocky Linux 8.6 kernel
(it seems the upstream kernel has the same race condition).
Disassembly shows the faulting instruction is cmp 0x50(%rdx),%rcx;
computing capacity != get_capacity(ns->disk).
Address 0x50 is dereferenced because ns->disk is NULL.
The NULL disk appears to be the result of concurrent scan work
freeing the namespace (note the log line in the middle of the panic).

CVE-2022-49006	2024-10-21T20:15:12.103	2024-11-04T13:16:22.623	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing: Free buffers when a used dynamic event is removed

After 65536 dynamic events have been added and removed, the ""type"" field
of the event then uses the first type number that is available (not
currently used by other events). A type number is the identifier of the
binary blobs in the tracing ring buffer (known as events) to map them to
logic that can parse the binary blob.

The issue is that if a dynamic event (like a kprobe event) is traced and
is in the ring buffer, and then that event is removed (because it is
dynamic, which means it can be created and destroyed), if another dynamic
event is created that has the same number that new event's logic on
parsing the binary blob will be used.

To show how this can be an issue, the following can crash the kernel:

 # cd /sys/kernel/tracing
 # for i in `seq 65536`; do
     echo 'p:kprobes/foo do_sys_openat2 $arg1:u32' > kprobe_events
 # done

For every iteration of the above, the writing to the kprobe_events will
remove the old event and create a new one (with the same format) and
increase the type number to the next available on until the type number
reaches over 65535 which is the max number for the 16 bit type. After it
reaches that number, the logic to allocate a new number simply looks for
the next available number. When an dynamic event is removed, that number
is then available to be reused by the next dynamic event created. That is,
once the above reaches the max number, the number assigned to the event in
that loop will remain the same.

Now that means deleting one dynamic event and created another will reuse
the previous events type number. This is where bad things can happen.
After the above loop finishes, the kprobes/foo event which reads the
do_sys_openat2 function call's first parameter as an integer.

 # echo 1 > kprobes/foo/enable
 # cat /etc/passwd > /dev/null
 # cat trace
             cat-2211    [005] ....  2007.849603: foo: (do_sys_openat2+0x0/0x130) arg1=4294967196

 # echo 0 > kprobes/foo/enable

Now if we delete the kprobe and create a new one that reads a string:

 # echo 'p:kprobes/foo do_sys_openat2 +0($arg2):string' > kprobe_events

And now we can the trace:

If DAT metadata file is corrupted on disk, there is a case where
req->pr_desc_bh is NULL and blocknr is 0 at nilfs_dat_commit_end() during
a b-tree operation that cascadingly updates ancestor nodes of the b-tree,
because nilfs_dat_commit_alloc() for a lower level block can initialize
the blocknr on the same DAT entry between nilfs_dat_prepare_end() and
nilfs_dat_commit_end().

If this happens, nilfs_dat_commit_end() calls nilfs_dat_commit_free()
without valid buffer heads in req->pr_desc_bh and req->pr_bitmap_bh, and
causes the NULL pointer dereference above in
nilfs_palloc_commit_free_entry() function, which leads to a crash.

Fix this by adding a NULL check on req->pr_desc_bh and req->pr_bitmap_bh
before nilfs_palloc_commit_free_entry() in nilfs_dat_commit_free().

This also calls nilfs_error() in that case to notify that there is a fatal

last reference count for struct net, and then notifier_call_chain()

Calling into kthread unparking unconditionally is mostly harmless when
the kthread is already unparked. The wake up is then simply ignored
because the target is not in TASK_PARKED state.

However if the kthread is per CPU, the wake up is preceded by a call
to kthread_bind() which expects the task to be inactive and in
TASK_PARKED state, which obviously isn't the case if it is unparked.

As a result, calling kthread_stop() on an unparked per-cpu kthread

ice: Fix improper handling of refcount in ice_sriov_set_msix_vec_count()

This patch addresses an issue with improper reference count handling in the
ice_sriov_set_msix_vec_count() function.

First, the function calls ice_get_vf_by_id(), which increments the
reference count of the vf pointer. If the subsequent call to
ice_get_vf_vsi() fails, the function currently returns an error without
decrementing the reference count of the vf pointer, leading to a reference
count leak. The correct behavior, as implemented in this patch, is to
decrement the reference count using ice_put_vf(vf) before returning an
error when vsi is NULL.

Second, the function calls ice_sriov_get_irqs(), which sets
vf->first_vector_idx. If this call returns a negative value, indicating an
error, the function returns an error without decrementing the reference
count of the vf pointer, resulting in another reference count leak. The
patch addresses this by adding a call to ice_put_vf(vf) before returning
an error when vf->first_vector_idx < 0.

This bug was identified by an experimental static analysis tool developed
by our team. The tool specializes in analyzing reference count operations
and identifying potential mismanagement of reference counts. In this case,
the tool flagged the missing decrement operation as a potential issue,

ice: Fix improper handling of refcount in ice_dpll_init_rclk_pins()

This patch addresses a reference count handling issue in the

which increments the reference count of the relevant resources. However,
if the condition WARN_ON((!vsi || !vsi->netdev)) is met, the function
currently returns an error without properly releasing the resources
acquired by ice_dpll_get_pins(), leading to a reference count leak.

To resolve this, the check has been moved to the top of the function. This
ensures that the function verifies the state before any resources are
acquired, avoiding the need for additional resource management in the
error path.

This bug was identified by an experimental static analysis tool developed

device-dax: correct pgoff align in dax_set_mapping()

pgoff should be aligned using ALIGN_DOWN() instead of ALIGN().  Otherwise,
vmf->address not aligned to fault_size will be aligned to the next
alignment, that can result in memory failure getting the wrong address.

It's a subtle situation that only can be observed in
page_mapped_in_vma() after the page is page fault handled by
dev_dax_huge_fault.  Generally, there is little chance to perform
page_mapped_in_vma in dev-dax's page unless in specific error injection
to the dax device to trigger an MCE - memory-failure.  In that case,
page_mapped_in_vma() will be triggered to determine which task is
accessing the failure address and kill that task in the end.


We used self-developed dax device (which is 2M aligned mapping) , to
perform error injection to random address.  It turned out that error
injected to non-2M-aligned address was causing endless MCE until panic.
Because page_mapped_in_vma() kept resulting wrong address and the task
accessing the failure address was never killed properly:

drm/xe/ct: prevent UAF in send_recv()

Ensure we serialize with completion side to prevent UAF with fence going
out of scope on the stack, since we have no clue if it will fire after
the timeout before we can erase from the xa. Also we have some dependent
loads and stores for which we need the correct ordering, and we lack the
needed barriers. Fix this by grabbing the ct->lock after the wait, which
is also held by the completion side.

v2 (Badal):
 - Also print done after acquiring the lock and seeing timeout.

This issue arises because, upon closing the file descriptor (which happens
when we interrupt `kmscube`), the active performance monitor is not
stopped. Although all perfmons are destroyed in `v3d_perfmon_close_file()`,
the active performance monitor's pointer (`v3d->active_perfmon`) is still
retained.

If `kmscube` is run again, the driver will attempt to stop the active
performance monitor using the stale pointer in `v3d->active_perfmon`.
However, this pointer is no longer valid because the previous process has
already terminated, and all performance monitors associated with it have
been destroyed and freed.

To fix this, when the active performance monitor belongs to a given
process, explicitly stop it before destroying and freeing it."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

syzbot found that slhc_remember() was missing checks against
malicious packets [1].

slhc_remember() only checked the size of the packet was at least 20,
which is not good enough.

We need to make sure the packet includes the IPv4 and TCP header
that are supposed to be carried.

Add iph and th pointers to make the code more readable.

This patch add a toy implementation that performs a simple return to
prevent such panic. This is because MSS can be set in sock_create_kern
or smc_setsockopt, similar to how it's done in AF_SMC. However, for
AF_SMC, there is currently no way to synchronize MSS within
__sys_connect_file. This toy implementation lays the groundwork for us
to support such feature for IPPROTO_SMC in the future."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

net: do not delay dst_entries_add() in dst_release()

dst_entries_add() uses per-cpu data that might be freed at netns
dismantle from ip6_route_net_exit() calling dst_entries_destroy()

Before ip6_route_net_exit() can be called, we release all
the dsts associated with this netns, via calls to dst_release(),
which waits an rcu grace period before calling dst_destroy()

dst_entries_add() use in dst_destroy() is racy, because
dst_entries_destroy() could have been called already.

Decrementing the number of dsts must happen sooner.

Notes:

1) in CONFIG_XFRM case, dst_destroy() can call
   dst_release_immediate(child), this might also cause UAF
   if the child does not have DST_NOCOUNT set.
   IPSEC maintainers might take a look and see how to address this.

2) There is also discussion about removing this count of dst,
   which might happen in future kernels."	7.0	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

netfilter: xtables: avoid NFPROTO_UNSPEC where needed

syzbot managed to call xt_cluster match via ebtables:

 WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 11 at net/netfilter/xt_cluster.c:72 xt_cluster_mt+0x196/0x780
 [..]
 ebt_do_table+0x174b/0x2a40

Module registers to NFPROTO_UNSPEC, but it assumes ipv4/ipv6 packet
processing.  As this is only useful to restrict locally terminating
TCP/UDP traffic, register this for ipv4 and ipv6 family only.

Pablo points out that this is a general issue, direct users of the
set/getsockopt interface can call into targets/matches that were only
intended for use with ip(6)tables.

Check all UNSPEC matches and targets for similar issues:

- matches and targets are fine except if they assume skb_network_header()
  is valid -- this is only true when called from inet layer: ip(6) stack
  pulls the ip/ipv6 header into linear data area.
- targets that return XT_CONTINUE or other xtables verdicts must be
  restricted too, they are incompatbile with the ebtables traverser, e.g.
  EBT_CONTINUE is a completely different value than XT_CONTINUE.

Most matches/targets are changed to register for NFPROTO_IPV4/IPV6, as
they are provided for use by ip(6)tables.

The MARK target is also used by arptables, so register for NFPROTO_ARP too.

While at it, bail out if connbytes fails to enable the corresponding
conntrack family.

This change passes the selftests in iptables.git."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

net/sched: accept TCA_STAB only for root qdisc

Most qdiscs maintain their backlog using qdisc_pkt_len(skb)
on the assumption it is invariant between the enqueue()
and dequeue() handlers.

Unfortunately syzbot can crash a host rather easily using
a TBF + SFQ combination, with an STAB on SFQ [1]

We can't support TCA_STAB on arbitrary level, this would
require to maintain per-qdisc storage.

igb: Do not bring the device up after non-fatal error

Commit 004d25060c78 (""igb: Fix igb_down hung on surprise removal"")
changed igb_io_error_detected() to ignore non-fatal pcie errors in order
to avoid hung task that can happen when igb_down() is called multiple
times. This caused an issue when processing transient non-fatal errors.
igb_io_resume(), which is called after igb_io_error_detected(), assumes
that device is brought down by igb_io_error_detected() if the interface
is up. This resulted in panic with stacktrace below.

i40e: Fix macvlan leak by synchronizing access to mac_filter_hash

This patch addresses a macvlan leak issue in the i40e driver caused by
concurrent access to vsi->mac_filter_hash. The leak occurs when multiple
threads attempt to modify the mac_filter_hash simultaneously, leading to
inconsistent state and potential memory leaks.

To fix this, we now wrap the calls to i40e_del_mac_filter() and zeroing
vf->default_lan_addr.addr with spin_lock/unlock_bh(&vsi->mac_filter_hash_lock),
ensuring atomic operations and preventing concurrent access.

Additionally, we add lockdep_assert_held(&vsi->mac_filter_hash_lock) in
i40e_add_mac_filter() to help catch similar issues in the future.

Reproduction steps:
1. Spawn VFs and configure port vlan on them.
2. Trigger concurrent macvlan operations (e.g., adding and deleting
	portvlan and/or mac filters).
3. Observe the potential memory leak and inconsistent state in the
	mac_filter_hash.

This synchronization ensures the integrity of the mac_filter_hash and prevents
the described leak."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

ice: Fix increasing MSI-X on VF

Increasing MSI-X value on a VF leads to invalid memory operations. This
is caused by not reallocating some arrays.

Reproducer:
  modprobe ice

Default MSI-X is 16, so 17 and above triggers this issue.

To fix it, use ice_vsi_rebuild() instead of ice_vf_reconfig_vsi(). This
causes the required arrays to be reallocated taking the new queue count
into account (ice_vsi_realloc_stat_arrays()). Set req_txq and req_rxq
before ice_vsi_rebuild(), so that realloc uses the newly set queue
count.

Additionally, ice_vsi_rebuild() does not remove VSI filters
(ice_fltr_remove_all()), so ice_vf_init_host_cfg() is no longer
necessary."	7.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H

netfilter: br_netfilter: fix panic with metadata_dst skb

Fix a kernel panic in the br_netfilter module when sending untagged
traffic via a VxLAN device.
This happens during the check for fragmentation in br_nf_dev_queue_xmit.

It is dependent on:
1) the br_netfilter module being loaded;
2) net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables set to 1;
3) a bridge with a VxLAN (single-vxlan-device) netdevice as a bridge port;
4) untagged frames with size higher than the VxLAN MTU forwarded/flooded

When forwarding the untagged packet to the VxLAN bridge port, before
the netfilter hooks are called, br_handle_egress_vlan_tunnel is called and
changes the skb_dst to the tunnel dst. The tunnel_dst is a metadata type
of dst, i.e., skb_valid_dst(skb) is false, and metadata->dst.dev is NULL.

Then in the br_netfilter hooks, in br_nf_dev_queue_xmit, there's a check
for frames that needs to be fragmented: frames with higher MTU than the
VxLAN device end up calling br_nf_ip_fragment, which in turns call
ip_skb_dst_mtu.

The ip_dst_mtu tries to use the skb_dst(skb) as if it was a valid dst
with valid dst->dev, thus the crash.

This case was never supported in the first place, so drop the packet
instead.

fbcon: Fix a NULL pointer dereference issue in fbcon_putcs

syzbot has found a NULL pointer dereference bug in fbcon.
Here is the simplified C reproducer:

int main()
{
	struct fb_con2fbmap con2fb;
	struct param param;

	int fd = open(""/dev/fb1"", 0, 0);

	param.ts.xs = 0; param.ts.ys = 0;
	param.ts.xe = 0; param.ts.ye = 0;
	param.ts.sel_mode = 0;

	int fd1 = open(""/dev/tty1"", O_RDWR, 0);

After calling ioctl(fd1, TIOCLINUX, &param), the subsequent ioctl(fd, FBIOPUT_CON2FBMAP, &con2fb)
causes the kernel to follow a different execution path:

the commit assumes, uport can be NULL in there. But right after that

bpf: Prevent tail call between progs attached to different hooks

bpf progs can be attached to kernel functions, and the attached functions
can take different parameters or return different return values. If
prog attached to one kernel function tail calls prog attached to another
kernel function, the ctx access or return value verification could be
bypassed.

For example, if prog1 is attached to func1 which takes only 1 parameter
and prog2 is attached to func2 which takes two parameters. Since verifier
assumes the bpf ctx passed to prog2 is constructed based on func2's
prototype, verifier allows prog2 to access the second parameter from
the bpf ctx passed to it. The problem is that verifier does not prevent
prog1 from passing its bpf ctx to prog2 via tail call. In this case,
the bpf ctx passed to prog2 is constructed from func1 instead of func2,
that is, the assumption for ctx access verification is bypassed.

Another example, if BPF LSM prog1 is attached to hook file_alloc_security,
and BPF LSM prog2 is attached to hook bpf_lsm_audit_rule_known. Verifier
knows the return value rules for these two hooks, e.g. it is legal for
bpf_lsm_audit_rule_known to return positive number 1, and it is illegal
for file_alloc_security to return positive number. So verifier allows
prog2 to return positive number 1, but does not allow prog1 to return
positive number. The problem is that verifier does not prevent prog1
from calling prog2 via tail call. In this case, prog2's return value 1
will be used as the return value for prog1's hook file_alloc_security.
That is, the return value rule is bypassed.

This patch adds restriction for tail call to prevent such bypasses."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Prior to Sep 27, 2024, if a user generated a terminal command via Cursor's Terminal Cmd-K/Ctrl-K feature and if the user explicitly imported a malicious web page into the Terminal Cmd-K prompt, an attacker with control over the referenced web page could have a significant chance of influencing a language model to output arbitrary commands for execution in the user's terminal. This scenario would require the user explicitly opt-in to including the contents of a compromised webpage, and it would require that the attacker display prompt injection text in the the contents of the compromised webpage.

A server-side patch to not stream back newlines or control characters was released on September 27, 2024, within two hours of the issue being reported. Additionally, Cursor 0.42 includes client-side mitigations to prevent any newline or control character from being streamed into the terminal directly. It also contains a new setting, `""cursor.terminal.usePreviewBox""`, which, if set to true, streams the response into a preview box whose contents then have to be manually accepted before being inserted into the terminal. This setting is useful if you're working in a shell environment where commands can be executed without pressing enter or any control character. The patch has been applied server-side, so no additional action is needed, even on older versions of Cursor. Separately, Cursor's maintainers also recommend, as best practice, to only include trusted pieces of context in prompts."

CVE-2024-50066	2024-10-23T06:15:10.467	2025-03-07T17:15:18.990	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/mremap: fix move_normal_pmd/retract_page_tables race

In mremap(), move_page_tables() looks at the type of the PMD entry and the
specified address range to figure out by which method the next chunk of
page table entries should be moved.

At that point, the mmap_lock is held in write mode, but no rmap locks are
held yet.  For PMD entries that point to page tables and are fully covered
by the source address range, move_pgt_entry(NORMAL_PMD, ...) is called,
which first takes rmap locks, then does move_normal_pmd(). 
move_normal_pmd() takes the necessary page table locks at source and
destination, then moves an entire page table from the source to the
destination.

The problem is: The rmap locks, which protect against concurrent page
table removal by retract_page_tables() in the THP code, are only taken
after the PMD entry has been read and it has been decided how to move it. 
So we can race as follows (with two processes that have mappings of the
same tmpfs file that is stored on a tmpfs mount with huge=advise); note
that process A accesses page tables through the MM while process B does it
through the file rmap:

process A                      process B

mremap
  mremap_to

      move_page_tables
        get_old_pmd
        alloc_new_pmd
                      *** PREEMPT ***
                               madvise(MADV_COLLAPSE)
                                 do_madvise
                                   madvise_walk_vmas
                                     madvise_vma_behavior
                                       madvise_collapse
                                         hpage_collapse_scan_file
                                           collapse_file
                                             retract_page_tables
                                               i_mmap_lock_read(mapping)
                                               pmdp_collapse_flush
                                               i_mmap_unlock_read(mapping)
        move_pgt_entry(NORMAL_PMD, ...)
          take_rmap_locks
          move_normal_pmd
          drop_rmap_locks

When this happens, move_normal_pmd() can end up creating bogus PMD entries
in the line `pmd_populate(mm, new_pmd, pmd_pgtable(pmd))`.  The effect
depends on arch-specific and machine-specific details; on x86, you can end
up with physical page 0 mapped as a page table, which is likely
exploitable for user->kernel privilege escalation.

Fix the race by letting process B recheck that the PMD still points to a
page table after the rmap locks have been taken.  Otherwise, we bail and
let the caller fall back to the PTE-level copying path, which will then
bail immediately at the pmd_none() check.

Bug reachability: Reaching this bug requires that you can create
shmem/file THP mappings - anonymous THP uses different code that doesn't
zap stuff under rmap locks.  File THP is gated on an experimental config
flag (CONFIG_READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS), so on normal distro kernels you need
shmem THP to hit this bug.  As far as I know, getting shmem THP normally
requires that you can mount your own tmpfs with the right mount flags,
which would require creating your own user+mount namespace; though I don't
know if some distros maybe enable shmem THP by default or something like
that.

Bug impact: This issue can likely be used for user->kernel privilege
escalation when it is reachable."	7.0	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.4.10, in certain very specific situations, it was possible for the policies of an update action to be skipped. This occurred only on ""empty"" update actions (no changing fields), and would allow their hooks (side effects) to be performed when they should not have been. Note that this does not allow reading new data that the user should not have had access to, only triggering a side effect a user should not have been able to trigger.

To be vulnerable, an affected user must have an update action that is on a resource with no attributes containing an ""update default"" (updated_at timestamp, for example); can be performed atomically; does not have `require_atomic? false`; has at least one authorizer (typically `Ash.Policy.Authorizer`); and has at least one `change` (on the resource's `changes` block or in the action itself). This is where the side-effects would be performed when they should not have been.

This problem has been patched in `2.4.10` of `ash_postgres`. Several workarounds are available. Potentially affected users may determine that none of their actions are vulnerable using a script the maintainers provide in the GitHub Security Advisory, add `require_atomic? false` to any potentially affected update action, replace any usage of `Ash.update` with `Ash.bulk_update` for an affected action, and/or add an update timestamp to their action."	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

The Butterfly framework uses the `java.net.URL` class to refer to (what are expected to be) local resource files, like images or templates. This works: ""opening a connection"" to these URLs opens the local file. However, prior to version 1.2.6, if a `file:/` URL is directly given where a relative path (resource name) is expected, this is also accepted in some code paths; the app then fetches the file, from a remote machine if indicated, and uses it as if it was a trusted part of the app's codebase. This leads to multiple weaknesses and potential weaknesses. An attacker that has network access to the application could use it to gain access to files, either on the the server's filesystem (path traversal) or shared by nearby machines (server-side request forgery with e.g. SMB). An attacker that can lead or redirect a user to a crafted URL belonging to the app could cause arbitrary attacker-controlled JavaScript to be loaded in the victim's browser (cross-site scripting). If an app is written in such a way that an attacker can influence the resource name used for a template, that attacker could cause the app to fetch and execute an attacker-controlled template (remote code execution).

CVE-2024-49359	2024-10-24T22:15:04.287	2025-09-22T14:21:53.893	ZimaOS is a fork of CasaOS, an operating system for Zima devices and x86-64 systems with UEFI. In version 1.2.4 and all prior versions, the API endpoint `http://<Zima_Server_IP:PORT>/v2_1/file` in ZimaOS is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack, allowing authenticated users to list the contents of any directory on the server. By manipulating the path parameter, attackers can access sensitive system directories such as `/etc`, potentially exposing critical configuration files and increasing the risk of further attacks. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2024-49750	2024-10-24T22:15:04.490	2024-11-06T14:58:19.993	The Snowflake Connector for Python provides an interface for developing Python applications that can connect to Snowflake and perform all standard operations. Prior to version 3.12.3, when the logging level was set by the user to DEBUG, the Connector could have logged Duo passcodes (when specified via the `passcode` parameter) and Azure SAS tokens. Additionally, the SecretDetector logging formatter, if enabled, contained bugs which caused it to not fully redact JWT tokens and certain private key formats. Snowflake released version 3.12.3 of the Snowflake Connector for Python, which fixes the issue. In addition to upgrading, users should review their logs for any potentially sensitive information that may have been captured.	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2024-49760	2024-10-24T22:15:04.703	2024-11-06T15:01:01.013	OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. The load-language command expects a `lang` parameter from which it constructs the path of the localization file to load, of the form `translations-$LANG.json`. But when doing so in versions prior to 3.8.3, it does not check that the resulting path is in the expected directory, which means that this command could be exploited to read other JSON files on the file system. Version 3.8.3 addresses this issue.	7.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2024-49762	2024-10-24T22:15:04.897	2024-10-25T12:56:07.750	Pterodactyl is a free, open-source game server management panel. When a user disables two-factor authentication via the Panel, a `DELETE` request with their current password in a query parameter will be sent.  While query parameters are encrypted when using TLS, many webservers (including ones officially documented for use with Pterodactyl) will log query parameters in plain-text, storing a user's password in plain text. Prior to version 1.11.8, if a malicious user obtains access to these logs they could potentially authenticate against a user's account; assuming they are able to discover the account's email address or username separately. This problem has been patched in version 1.11.8. There are no workarounds at this time. There is not a direct vulnerability within the software as it relates to logs generated by intermediate components such as web servers or Layer 7 proxies. Updating to `v1.11.8` or adding the linked patch manually are the only ways to avoid this problem. As this vulnerability relates to historical logging of sensitive data, users who have ever disabled 2FA on a Panel (self-hosted or operated by a company) should change their passwords and consider enabling 2FA if it was left disabled. While it's unlikely that their account swill be compromised by this vulnerability, it's not impossible. Panel administrators should consider clearing any access logs that may contain sensitive data.	4.6	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

CVE-2024-50067	2024-10-28T01:15:02.930	2024-12-11T15:15:10.943	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

uprobe: avoid out-of-bounds memory access of fetching args

Uprobe needs to fetch args into a percpu buffer, and then copy to ring
buffer to avoid non-atomic context problem.

Sometimes user-space strings, arrays can be very large, but the size of
percpu buffer is only page size. And store_trace_args() won't check
whether these data exceeds a single page or not, caused out-of-bounds
memory access.

It could be reproduced by following steps:
1. build kernel with CONFIG_KASAN enabled
2. save follow program as test.c

```
\#include <stdio.h>
\#include <stdlib.h>
\#include <string.h>

// If string length large than MAX_STRING_SIZE, the fetch_store_strlen()
// will return 0, cause __get_data_size() return shorter size, and
// store_trace_args() will not trigger out-of-bounds access.
// So make string length less than 4096.
\#define STRLEN 4093

void generate_string(char *str, int n)
{
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    {
        char c = i % 26 + 'a';
        str[i] = c;
    }
    str[n-1] = '\0';
}

void print_string(char *str)
{
    printf(""%s\n"", str);
}

int main()
{
    char tmp[STRLEN];

    generate_string(tmp, STRLEN);
    print_string(tmp);

    return 0;
}
```
3. compile program
`gcc -o test test.c`

4. get the offset of `print_string()`
```
objdump -t test | grep -w print_string
0000000000401199 g     F .text  000000000000001b              print_string
```

5. configure uprobe with offset 0x1199
```
off=0x1199

cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/
echo ""p /root/test:${off} arg1=+0(%di):ustring arg2=\$comm arg3=+0(%di):ustring""
 > uprobe_events
echo 1 > events/uprobes/enable
echo 1 > tracing_on
```

6. run `test`, and kasan will report error.

When the sqpoll is exiting and cancels pending work items, it may need

results in the below splat from the scheduler, as the ring mutex may be

So rq_qos_wake_function() calls wake_up_process(data->task), which calls
try_to_wake_up(), which faults in raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&p->pi_lock).

p comes from data->task, and data comes from the waitqueue entry, which
is stored on the waiter's stack in rq_qos_wait(). Analyzing the core
dump with drgn, I found that the waiter had already woken up and moved
on to a completely unrelated code path, clobbering what was previously
data->task. Meanwhile, the waker was passing the clobbered garbage in
data->task to wake_up_process(), leading to the crash.

What's happening is that in between rq_qos_wake_function() deleting the
waitqueue entry and calling wake_up_process(), rq_qos_wait() is finding
that it already got a token and returning. The race looks like this:

rq_qos_wait()                           rq_qos_wake_function()
==============================================================
prepare_to_wait_exclusive()
                                        data->got_token = true;
                                        list_del_init(&curr->entry);
if (data.got_token)
        break;
finish_wait(&rqw->wait, &data.wq);
  ^- returns immediately because
     list_empty_careful(&wq_entry->entry)
     is true
... return, go do something else ...
                                        wake_up_process(data->task)
                                          (NO LONGER VALID!)-^

Normally, finish_wait() is supposed to synchronize against the waker.
But, as noted above, it is returning immediately because the waitqueue
entry has already been removed from the waitqueue.

The bug is that rq_qos_wake_function() is accessing the waitqueue entry
AFTER deleting it. Note that autoremove_wake_function() wakes the waiter
and THEN deletes the waitqueue entry, which is the proper order.

Fix it by swapping the order. We also need to use
list_del_init_careful() to match the list_empty_careful() in
finish_wait()."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-49768	2024-10-29T15:15:11.440	2024-11-07T17:28:02.853	Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. A remote client may send a request that is exactly recv_bytes (defaults to 8192) long, followed by a secondary request using HTTP pipelining. When request lookahead is disabled (default) we won't read any more requests, and when the first request fails due to a parsing error, we simply close the connection. However when request lookahead is enabled, it is possible to process and receive the first request, start sending the error message back to the client while we read the next request and queue it. This will allow the secondary request to be serviced by the worker thread while the connection should be closed. Waitress 3.0.1 fixes the race condition. As a workaround, disable channel_request_lookahead, this is set to 0 by default disabling this feature.	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

On macOS, built-in builders (such as `builtin:fetchurl`, exposed to users with `import <nix/fetchurl.nix>`) were not executed in the macOS sandbox. Thus, these builders (which are running under the `nixbld*` users) had read access to world-readable paths and write access to world-writable paths outside of the sandbox. This issue is fixed in 2.18.9, 2.19.7, 2.20.9, 2.21.5, 2.22.4, 2.23.4, and 2.24.10. Note that sandboxing is not enabled by default on macOS. The Nix sandbox is not primarily intended as a security mechanism, but as an aid to improve reproducibility and purity of Nix builds. However, sandboxing *can* mitigate the impact of other security issues by limiting what parts of the host system a build has access to.
