Prior to version 2025.628.4510, the web UI of Sunshine lacks protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to craft a malicious web page that, when visited by an authenticated user, can trigger unintended actions within the Sunshine application on behalf of that user. Specifically, since the application does OS command execution by design, this issue can be exploited to abuse the ""Command Preparations"" feature, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed with Administrator privileges when an application is launched. This issue has been patched in version 2025.628.4510."	9.6	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2024-46993	2025-07-01T03:15:21.020	2025-07-03T15:14:12.767	Electron is an open source framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. In versions prior to 28.3.2, 29.3.3, and 30.0.3, the nativeImage.createFromPath() and nativeImage.createFromBuffer() functions call a function downstream that is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. An Electron program that uses either of the affected functions is vulnerable to a buffer overflow if an attacker is in control of the image's height, width, and contents. This issue has been patched in versions  28.3.2, 29.3.3, and 30.0.3. There are no workarounds for this issue.					
CVE-2024-49364	2025-07-01T03:15:21.163	2025-07-03T15:14:12.767	tiny-secp256k1 is a tiny secp256k1 native/JS wrapper. Prior to version 1.1.7, a private key can be extracted on signing a malicious JSON-stringifiable object, when global Buffer is the buffer package. This affects only environments where require('buffer') is the NPM buffer package. The Buffer.isBuffer check can be bypassed, resulting in k reuse for different messages, leading to private key extraction over a single invalid message (and a second one for which any message/signature could be taken, e.g. previously known valid one). This issue has been patched in version 1.1.7.					
CVE-2024-49365	2025-07-01T03:15:21.327	2025-07-03T15:14:12.767	tiny-secp256k1 is a tiny secp256k1 native/JS wrapper. Prior to version 1.1.7, a malicious JSON-stringifyable message can be made passing on verify(), when global Buffer is the buffer package. This affects only environments where require('buffer') is the NPM buffer package. Buffer.isBuffer check can be bypassed, resulting in strange objects being accepted as a message, and those messages could trick verify() into returning false-positive true values. This issue has been patched in version 1.1.7.

espintcp: remove encap socket caching to avoid reference leak

The current scheme for caching the encap socket can lead to reference
leaks when we try to delete the netns.

The reference chain is: xfrm_state -> enacp_sk -> netns

Since the encap socket is a userspace socket, it holds a reference on
the netns. If we delete the espintcp state (through flush or
individual delete) before removing the netns, the reference on the
socket is dropped and the netns is correctly deleted. Otherwise, the
netns may not be reachable anymore (if all processes within the ns
have terminated), so we cannot delete the xfrm state to drop its
reference on the socket.

This patch results in a small (~2% in my tests) performance
regression.

A GC-type mechanism could be added for the socket cache, to clear
references if the state hasn't been used ""recently"", but it's a lot
more complex than just not caching the socket."

x86/iopl: Cure TIF_IO_BITMAP inconsistencies

io_bitmap_exit() is invoked from exit_thread() when a task exists or
when a fork fails. In the latter case the exit_thread() cleans up
resources which were allocated during fork().

io_bitmap_exit() invokes task_update_io_bitmap(), which in turn ends up
in tss_update_io_bitmap(). tss_update_io_bitmap() operates on the
current task. If current has TIF_IO_BITMAP set, but no bitmap installed,
tss_update_io_bitmap() crashes with a NULL pointer dereference.

There are two issues, which lead to that problem:

  1) io_bitmap_exit() should not invoke task_update_io_bitmap() when
     the task, which is cleaned up, is not the current task. That's a
     clear indicator for a cleanup after a failed fork().

  2) A task should not have TIF_IO_BITMAP set and neither a bitmap
     installed nor IOPL emulation level 3 activated.

     This happens when a kernel thread is created in the context of
     a user space thread, which has TIF_IO_BITMAP set as the thread
     flags are copied and the IO bitmap pointer is cleared.

     Other than in the failed fork() case this has no impact because
     kernel threads including IO workers never return to user space and
     therefore never invoke tss_update_io_bitmap().

Cure this by adding the missing cleanups and checks:

  1) Prevent io_bitmap_exit() to invoke task_update_io_bitmap() if
     the to be cleaned up task is not the current task.

  2) Clear TIF_IO_BITMAP in copy_thread() unconditionally. For user
     space forks it is set later, when the IO bitmap is inherited in
     io_bitmap_share().

For paranoia sake, add a warning into tss_update_io_bitmap() to catch
the case, when that code is invoked with inconsistent state."

e1000: Move cancel_work_sync to avoid deadlock

Previously, e1000_down called cancel_work_sync for the e1000 reset task
(via e1000_down_and_stop), which takes RTNL.

As reported by users and syzbot, a deadlock is possible in the following
scenario:

CPU 0:
  - RTNL is held
  - e1000_close
  - e1000_down
  - cancel_work_sync (cancel / wait for e1000_reset_task())

CPU 1:
  - process_one_work
  - e1000_reset_task
  - take RTNL

To remedy this, avoid calling cancel_work_sync from e1000_down
(e1000_reset_task does nothing if the device is down anyway). Instead,
call cancel_work_sync for e1000_reset_task when the device is being
removed."

net: fix udp gso skb_segment after pull from frag_list

Commit a1e40ac5b5e9 (""net: gso: fix udp gso fraglist segmentation after
pull from frag_list"") detected invalid geometry in frag_list skbs and
redirects them from skb_segment_list to more robust skb_segment. But some
packets with modified geometry can also hit bugs in that code. We don't
know how many such cases exist. Addressing each one by one also requires
touching the complex skb_segment code, which risks introducing bugs for
other types of skbs. Instead, linearize all these packets that fail the
basic invariants on gso fraglist skbs. That is more robust.

If only part of the fraglist payload is pulled into head_skb, it will
always cause exception when splitting skbs by skb_segment. For detailed
call stack information, see below.

Valid SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST skbs
- consist of two or more segments
- the head_skb holds the protocol headers plus first gso_size
- one or more frag_list skbs hold exactly one segment
- all but the last must be gso_size

Optional datapath hooks such as NAT and BPF (bpf_skb_pull_data) can
modify fraglist skbs, breaking these invariants.

In extreme cases they pull one part of data into skb linear. For UDP,
this  causes three payloads with lengths of (11,11,10) bytes were
pulled tail to become (12,10,10) bytes.

The skbs no longer meets the above SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST conditions because
payload was pulled into head_skb, it needs to be linearized before pass
to regular skb_segment.

usb: renesas_usbhs: Reorder clock handling and power management in probe

Reorder the initialization sequence in `usbhs_probe()` to enable runtime
PM before accessing registers, preventing potential crashes due to
uninitialized clocks.

Currently, in the probe path, registers are accessed before enabling the
clocks, leading to a synchronous external abort on the RZ/V2H SoC.
The problematic call flow is as follows:

    usbhs_probe()
        usbhs_sys_clock_ctrl()
            usbhs_bset()
                usbhs_write()

Since `iowrite16()` is performed without ensuring the required clocks are
enabled, this can lead to access errors. To fix this, enable PM runtime
early in the probe function and ensure clocks are acquired before register
access, preventing crashes like the following on RZ/V2H:

dm: limit swapping tables for devices with zone write plugs

dm_revalidate_zones() only allowed new or previously unzoned devices to
call blk_revalidate_disk_zones(). If the device was already zoned,
disk->nr_zones would always equal md->nr_zones, so dm_revalidate_zones()
returned without doing any work. This would make the zoned settings for
the device not match the new table. If the device had zone write plug
resources, it could run into errors like bdev_zone_is_seq() reading
invalid memory because disk->conv_zones_bitmap was the wrong size.

If the device doesn't have any zone write plug resources, calling
blk_revalidate_disk_zones() will always correctly update device.  If
blk_revalidate_disk_zones() fails, it can still overwrite or clear the
current disk->nr_zones value. In this case, DM must restore the previous
value of disk->nr_zones, so that the zoned settings will continue to
match the previous value that it fell back to.

If the device already has zone write plug resources,
blk_revalidate_disk_zones() will not correctly update them, if it is
called for arbitrary zoned device changes.  Since there is not much need
for this ability, the easiest solution is to disallow any table reloads
that change the zoned settings, for devices that already have zone plug
resources.  Specifically, if a device already has zone plug resources
allocated, it can only switch to another zoned table that also emulates
zone append.  Also, it cannot change the device size or the zone size. A
device can switch to an error target."					
CVE-2025-38141	2025-07-03T09:15:28.740	2025-07-03T15:13:53.147	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm: fix dm_blk_report_zones

If dm_get_live_table() returned NULL, dm_put_live_table() was never
called. Also, it is possible that md->zone_revalidate_map will change
while calling this function. Only read it once, so that we are always
using the same value. Otherwise we might miss a call to
dm_put_live_table().

Finally, while md->zone_revalidate_map is set and a process is calling
blk_revalidate_disk_zones() to set up the zone append emulation
resources, it is possible that another process, perhaps triggered by
blkdev_report_zones_ioctl(), will call dm_blk_report_zones(). If
blk_revalidate_disk_zones() fails, these resources can be freed while
the other process is still using them, causing a use-after-free error.

blk_revalidate_disk_zones() will only ever be called when initially
setting up the zone append emulation resources, such as when setting up
a zoned dm-crypt table for the first time. Further table swaps will not
set md->zone_revalidate_map or call blk_revalidate_disk_zones().
However it must be called using the new table (referenced by
md->zone_revalidate_map) and the new queue limits while the DM device is
suspended. dm_blk_report_zones() needs some way to distinguish between a
call from blk_revalidate_disk_zones(), which must be allowed to use
md->zone_revalidate_map to access this not yet activated table, and all
other calls to dm_blk_report_zones(), which should not be allowed while
the device is suspended and cannot use md->zone_revalidate_map, since
the zone resources might be freed by the process currently calling
blk_revalidate_disk_zones().

Solve this by tracking the process that sets md->zone_revalidate_map in
dm_revalidate_zones() and only allowing that process to make use of it

calipso: Don't call calipso functions for AF_INET sk.

syzkaller reported a null-ptr-deref in txopt_get(). [0]

The offset 0x70 was of struct ipv6_txoptions in struct ipv6_pinfo,
so struct ipv6_pinfo was NULL there.

However, this never happens for IPv6 sockets as inet_sk(sk)->pinet6
is always set in inet6_create(), meaning the socket was not IPv6 one.

The root cause is missing validation in netlbl_conn_setattr().

netlbl_conn_setattr() switches branches based on struct
sockaddr.sa_family, which is passed from userspace.  However,
netlbl_conn_setattr() does not check if the address family matches
the socket.

The syzkaller must have called connect() for an IPv6 address on
an IPv4 socket.

We have a proper validation in tcp_v[46]_connect(), but
security_socket_connect() is called in the earlier stage.

Let's copy the validation to netlbl_conn_setattr().

net: phy: clear phydev->devlink when the link is deleted

There is a potential crash issue when disabling and re-enabling the
network port. When disabling the network port, phy_detach() calls
device_link_del() to remove the device link, but it does not clear
phydev->devlink, so phydev->devlink is not a NULL pointer. Then the
network port is re-enabled, but if phy_attach_direct() fails before
calling device_link_add(), the code jumps to the ""error"" label and
calls phy_detach(). Since phydev->devlink retains the old value from
the previous attach/detach cycle, device_link_del() uses the old value,
which accesses a NULL pointer and causes a crash. The simplified crash
log is as follows.

The work item was re-initialized in the second call, which corrupted the
work item currently in the work queue.

However, it left a problem when queue_work fails (because the item is
still pending in the work queue from a previous call). In this case,
cma_id_put (which is called in the work handler) is therefore not

net: usb: aqc111: fix error handling of usbnet read calls

Syzkaller, courtesy of syzbot, identified an error (see report [1]) in
aqc111 driver, caused by incomplete sanitation of usb read calls'
results. This problem is quite similar to the one fixed in commit
920a9fa27e78 (""net: asix: add proper error handling of usb read errors"").

For instance, usbnet_read_cmd() may read fewer than 'size' bytes,
even if the caller expected the full amount, and aqc111_read_cmd()
will not check its result properly. As [1] shows, this may lead
to MAC address in aqc111_bind() being only partly initialized,
triggering KMSAN warnings.

Fix the issue by verifying that the number of bytes read is
as expected and not less.

The sk->sk_socket is not locked or referenced in backlog thread, and

the release of sk_socket. All types of sockets(tcp/udp/unix/vsock)

Race conditions:

'''

Based on the fact that we already wait for the workqueue to finish in
sock_map_close() if psock is held, we simply increase the psock
reference count to avoid race conditions.

With this patch, if the backlog thread is running, sock_map_close() will
wait for the backlog thread to complete and cancel all pending work.

If no backlog running, any pending work that hasn't started by then will
fail when invoked by sk_psock_get(), as the psock reference count have
been zeroed, and sk_psock_drop() will cancel all jobs via
cancel_delayed_work_sync().

In summary, we require synchronization to coordinate the backlog thread
and close() thread.

hisi_acc_vfio_pci: fix XQE dma address error

The dma addresses of EQE and AEQE are wrong after migration and

Comparing the definition of hardware registers, we found that
there was an error when the data read from the register was

Even after fixing the above problem, we still have an issue

The panic originates from the assertion BUG_ON(skb_shared(skb)) in
skb_linearize(). A previous commit(see Fixes tag) introduced skb_get()
to avoid race conditions between skb operations in the backlog and skb
release in the recvmsg path. However, this caused the panic to always
occur when skb_linearize is executed.

The ""--rx-strp 100000"" parameter forces the RX path to use the strparser
module which aggregates data until it reaches 100KB before calling sockmap
logic. The 100KB payload exceeds MAX_MSG_FRAGS, triggering skb_linearize.

To fix this issue, just move skb_get into sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue.

After calling bpf_exec_tx_verdict(), the size of msg_pl->sg may increase,
e.g., when the BPF program executes bpf_msg_push_data().

If the BPF program sets cork_bytes and sg.size is smaller than cork_bytes,
it will return -ENOSPC and attempt to roll back to the non-zero copy
logic. However, during rollback, msg->msg_iter is reset, but since
msg_pl->sg.size has been increased, subsequent executions will exceed the
actual size of msg_iter.
'''
iov_iter_revert(&msg->msg_iter, msg_pl->sg.size - orig_size);
'''

The changes in this commit are based on the following considerations:

1. When cork_bytes is set, rolling back to non-zero copy logic is
pointless and can directly go to zero-copy logic.

2. We can not calculate the correct number of bytes to revert msg_iter.

Assume the original data is ""abcdefgh"" (8 bytes), and after 3 pushes
by the BPF program, it becomes 11-byte data: ""abc?de?fgh?"".
Then, we set cork_bytes to 6, which means the first 6 bytes have been
processed, and the remaining 5 bytes ""?fgh?"" will be cached until the
length meets the cork_bytes requirement.

However, some data in ""?fgh?"" is not within 'sg->msg_iter'
(but in msg_pl instead), especially the data ""?"" we pushed.

So it doesn't seem as simple as just reverting through an offset of
msg_iter.

3. For non-TLS sockets in tcp_bpf_sendmsg, when a ""cork"" situation occurs,
the user-space send() doesn't return an error, and the returned length is
the same as the input length parameter, even if some data is cached.

Additionally, I saw that the current non-zero-copy logic for handling
corking is written as:
'''
line 1177
else if (ret != -EAGAIN) {
	if (ret == -ENOSPC)
		ret = 0;
	goto send_end;
'''

So it's ok to just return 'copied' without error when a ""cork"" situation
occurs."

SMP: stopping secondary CPUs"					
CVE-2025-38169	2025-07-03T09:15:32.517	2025-07-03T15:13:53.147	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/fpsimd: Avoid clobbering kernel FPSIMD state with SMSTOP

On system with SME, a thread's kernel FPSIMD state may be erroneously
clobbered during a context switch immediately after that state is
restored. Systems without SME are unaffected.

If the CPU happens to be in streaming SVE mode before a context switch
to a thread with kernel FPSIMD state, fpsimd_thread_switch() will
restore the kernel FPSIMD state using fpsimd_load_kernel_state() while
the CPU is still in streaming SVE mode. When fpsimd_thread_switch()
subsequently calls fpsimd_flush_cpu_state(), this will execute an
SMSTOP, causing an exit from streaming SVE mode. The exit from
streaming SVE mode will cause the hardware to reset a number of
FPSIMD/SVE/SME registers, clobbering the FPSIMD state.

Fix this by calling fpsimd_flush_cpu_state() before restoring the kernel
FPSIMD state."					
CVE-2025-38170	2025-07-03T09:15:32.643	2025-07-03T15:13:53.147	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/fpsimd: Discard stale CPU state when handling SME traps

The logic for handling SME traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE/SME state
incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having
TIF_SME set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state
is stale (e.g. with SME traps enabled). This can result in warnings from
do_sme_acc() where SME traps are not expected while TIF_SME is set:

|        /* With TIF_SME userspace shouldn't generate any traps */
|        if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SME))
|                WARN_ON(1);

This is very similar to the SVE issue we fixed in commit:

  751ecf6afd6568ad (""arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps"")

The race can occur when the SME trap handler is preempted before and
after manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE/SME state, starting and ending on
the same CPU, e.g.

| void do_sme_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs)
| {
|         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SME clear, SME traps enabled
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is 0.
|         // per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task.
|
|         ...
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1.
|         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.
|
|         get_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         /* With TIF_SME userspace shouldn't generate any traps */
|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SME))
|                 WARN_ON(1);
|
|         if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) {
|                 unsigned long vq_minus_one =
|                         sve_vq_from_vl(task_get_sme_vl(current)) - 1;
|                 sme_set_vq(vq_minus_one);
|
|                 fpsimd_bind_task_to_cpu();
|         }
|
|         put_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0.
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is still 0
|         // If per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then:
|         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SME traps enabled)
|         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared
|         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore
| }

Fix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set
by calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU
state. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the
stale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the
new state to be reloaded from memory prior to a return to userspace.

erofs: avoid using multiple devices with different type

For multiple devices, both primary and extra devices should be the
same type. `erofs_init_device` has already guaranteed that if the
primary is a file-backed device, extra devices should also be
regular files.

However, if the primary is a block device while the extra device
is a file-backed device, `erofs_init_device` will get an ENOTBLK,
which is not treated as an error in `erofs_fc_get_tree`, and that
leads to an UAF:

  erofs_fc_get_tree
    get_tree_bdev_flags(erofs_fc_fill_super)

    if (err is -ENOTBLK)
      sbi->dif0.file = filp_open()  // sbi UAF

So if -ENOTBLK is hitted in `erofs_init_device`, it means the
primary device must be a block device, and the extra device
is not a block device. The error can be converted to -EINVAL."

Prior to version 1.22.0, a vulnerability was identified in tarteaucitron.js where document.currentScript was accessed without verifying that it referenced an actual <script> element. If an attacker injected an HTML element, it could clobber the document.currentScript property. This causes the script to resolve incorrectly to an element instead of the <script> tag, leading to unexpected behavior or failure to load the script path correctly. This issue arises because in some browser environments, named DOM elements become properties on the global document object. An attacker with control over the HTML could exploit this to change the CDN domain of tarteaucitron.

From Wire iOS 3.111.1 to before 3.124.1, messages that were visible in the view port have been logged to the iOS system logs in clear text. Wire application logs created and managed by the application itself were not affected, especially not the logs users can export and send to Wire support. The iOS logs can only be accessed if someone had (physical) access to the underlying unlocked device. The issue manifested itself by calling canOpenUrl() and passing an invalid URL object. When iOS then performs the check and fails, it logs the contents to the system log. This is not documented behaviour. Wire released an emergency fix with version 3.124.1. As a workaround, users can reset their iOS device to remove the offending logs. Since Wire cannot access or modify iOS system logs, there's no other workaround other than a reset.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Employee-level access and above, to elevate their privileges to administrator.	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

The plugin’s deletion handler reads the client-supplied $_POST['delete'] array and passes each ID directly to wp_delete_user() without verifying that the caller has the delete_users capability or limiting which user IDs may be removed. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Employee-level access and above, to delete arbitrary accounts, including administrators.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

CVE-2025-7066	2025-07-04T12:15:35.740	2025-08-14T14:00:20.763	Jirafeau normally prevents browser preview for text files due to the possibility that for example SVG and HTML documents could be exploited for cross site scripting. This was done by storing the MIME type of a file and allowing only browser preview for MIME types beginning with image (except for image/svg+xml, see CVE-2022-30110 and CVE-2024-12326), video and audio. However, it was possible to bypass this check by sending a manipulated MIME type containing a comma and an other MIME type like text/html (for example image/png,text/html). Browsers see multiple MIME types and text/html would takes precedence, allowing a possible attacker to do a cross-site scripting attack. The check for MIME types was enhanced to prevent a browser preview when the stored MIME type contains a comma.	6.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

sch_hfsc: make hfsc_qlen_notify() idempotent

hfsc_qlen_notify() is not idempotent either and not friendly
to its callers, like fq_codel_dequeue(). Let's make it idempotent
to ease qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() callers' life:

1. update_vf() decreases cl->cl_nactive, so we can check whether it is
non-zero before calling it.

2. eltree_remove() always removes RB node cl->el_node, but we can use
   RB_EMPTY_NODE() + RB_CLEAR_NODE() to make it safe."

CVE-2025-38181	2025-07-04T14:15:24.860	2025-07-08T16:18:53.607	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

calipso: Fix null-ptr-deref in calipso_req_{set,del}attr().

syzkaller reported a null-ptr-deref in sock_omalloc() while allocating
a CALIPSO option.  [0]

The NULL is of struct sock, which was fetched by sk_to_full_sk() in
calipso_req_setattr().

Since commit a1a5344ddbe8 (""tcp: avoid two atomic ops for syncookies""),
reqsk->rsk_listener could be NULL when SYN Cookie is returned to its
client, as hinted by the leading SYN Cookie log.

Here are 3 options to fix the bug:

  1) Return 0 in calipso_req_setattr()
  2) Return an error in calipso_req_setattr()
  3) Alaways set rsk_listener

1) is no go as it bypasses LSM, but 2) effectively disables SYN Cookie
for CALIPSO.  3) is also no go as there have been many efforts to reduce
atomic ops and make TCP robust against DDoS.  See also commit 3b24d854cb35
(""tcp/dccp: do not touch listener sk_refcnt under synflood"").

As of the blamed commit, SYN Cookie already did not need refcounting,
and no one has stumbled on the bug for 9 years, so no CALIPSO user will
care about SYN Cookie.

Let's return an error in calipso_req_setattr() and calipso_req_delattr()
in the SYN Cookie case.

This can be reproduced by [1] on Fedora and now connect() of nc times out.

vcc_sendmsg() copies data passed from userspace to skb and passes
it to vcc->dev->ops->send().

atmtcp_c_send() accesses skb->data as struct atmtcp_hdr after
checking if skb->len is 0, but it's not enough.

Also, when skb->len == 0, skb and sk (vcc) were leaked because
dev_kfree_skb() is not called and sk_wmem_alloc adjustment is missing
to revert atm_account_tx() in vcc_sendmsg(), which is expected
to be done in atm_pop_raw().

It is expected to be reverted by atm_pop_raw() later called by

code checks only the total count of buffers, but given that the indexing

Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception

[ Analysis ]

We believe that we have found a concurrency bug in the `fs/jfs` module
that results in a null pointer dereference. There is a closely related
issue which has been fixed:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=d6c1b3599b2feb5c7291f5ac3a36e5fa7cedb234

... but, unfortunately, the accepted patch appears to still be
susceptible to a null pointer dereference under some interleavings.

To trigger the bug, we think that `JFS_SBI(ipbmap->i_sb)->bmap` is set
to NULL in `dbFreeBits` and then dereferenced in `jfs_ioc_trim`. This
bug manifests quite rarely under normal circumstances, but is
triggereable from a syz-program."

mm: fix uprobe pte be overwritten when expanding vma

Patch series ""Fix uprobe pte be overwritten when expanding vma"".


This patch (of 4):

We encountered a BUG alert triggered by Syzkaller as follows:
   BUG: Bad rss-counter state mm:00000000b4a60fca type:MM_ANONPAGES val:1

And we can reproduce it with the following steps:
1. register uprobe on file at zero offset
2. mmap the file at zero offset:
   addr1 = mmap(NULL, 2 * 4096, PROT_NONE, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);
3. mremap part of vma1 to new vma2:
   addr2 = mremap(addr1, 4096, 2 * 4096, MREMAP_MAYMOVE);
4. mremap back to orig addr1:
   mremap(addr2, 4096, 4096, MREMAP_MAYMOVE | MREMAP_FIXED, addr1);

In step 3, the vma1 range [addr1, addr1 + 4096] will be remap to new vma2
with range [addr2, addr2 + 8192], and remap uprobe anon page from the vma1
to vma2, then unmap the vma1 range [addr1, addr1 + 4096].

In step 4, the vma2 range [addr2, addr2 + 4096] will be remap back to the
addr range [addr1, addr1 + 4096].  Since the addr range [addr1 + 4096,
addr1 + 8192] still maps the file, it will take vma_merge_new_range to
expand the range, and then do uprobe_mmap in vma_complete.  Since the
merged vma pgoff is also zero offset, it will install uprobe anon page to
the merged vma.  However, the upcomming move_page_tables step, which use
set_pte_at to remap the vma2 uprobe pte to the merged vma, will overwrite
the newly uprobe pte in the merged vma, and lead that pte to be orphan.

Since the uprobe pte will be remapped to the merged vma, we can remove the
unnecessary uprobe_mmap upon merged vma.

This problem was first found in linux-6.6.y and also exists in the
community syzkaller:

nvme-tcp: remove tag set when second admin queue config fails

Commit 104d0e2f6222 (""nvme-fabrics: reset admin connection for secure
concatenation"") modified nvme_tcp_setup_ctrl() to call
nvme_tcp_configure_admin_queue() twice. The first call prepares for
DH-CHAP negotitation, and the second call is required for secure
concatenation. However, this change triggered BUG KASAN slab-use-after-
free in blk_mq_queue_tag_busy_iter(). This BUG can be recreated by
repeating the blktests test case nvme/063 a few times [1].

When the BUG happens, nvme_tcp_create_ctrl() fails in the call chain
below:

nvme_tcp_create_ctrl()
 nvme_tcp_alloc_ctrl() new=true             ... Alloc nvme_tcp_ctrl and admin_tag_set
 nvme_tcp_setup_ctrl() new=true
  nvme_tcp_configure_admin_queue() new=true ... Succeed
   nvme_alloc_admin_tag_set()               ... Alloc the tag set for admin_tag_set
  nvme_stop_keep_alive()
  nvme_tcp_teardown_admin_queue() remove=false
  nvme_tcp_configure_admin_queue() new=false
   nvme_tcp_alloc_admin_queue()             ... Fail, but do not call nvme_remove_admin_tag_set()
 nvme_uninit_ctrl()
 nvme_put_ctrl()                            ... Free up the nvme_tcp_ctrl and admin_tag_set

The first call of nvme_tcp_configure_admin_queue() succeeds with
new=true argument. The second call fails with new=false argument. This
second call does not call nvme_remove_admin_tag_set() on failure, due to
the new=false argument. Then the admin tag set is not removed. However,
nvme_tcp_create_ctrl() assumes that nvme_tcp_setup_ctrl() would call
nvme_remove_admin_tag_set(). Then it frees up struct nvme_tcp_ctrl which
has admin_tag_set field. Later on, the timeout handler accesses the
admin_tag_set field and causes the BUG KASAN slab-use-after-free.

To not leave the admin tag set, call nvme_remove_admin_tag_set() when
the second nvme_tcp_configure_admin_queue() call fails. Do not return
from nvme_tcp_setup_ctrl() on failure. Instead, jump to ""destroy_admin""
go-to label to call nvme_tcp_teardown_admin_queue() which calls
nvme_remove_admin_tag_set()."					
CVE-2025-38210	2025-07-04T14:15:29.207	2025-07-08T16:18:53.607	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

configfs-tsm-report: Fix NULL dereference of tsm_ops

Unlike sysfs, the lifetime of configfs objects is controlled by
userspace. There is no mechanism for the kernel to find and delete all
created config-items. Instead, the configfs-tsm-report mechanism has an
expectation that tsm_unregister() can happen at any time and cause
established config-item access to start failing.

That expectation is not fully satisfied. While tsm_report_read(),
tsm_report_{is,is_bin}_visible(), and tsm_report_make_item() safely fail
if tsm_ops have been unregistered, tsm_report_privlevel_store()
tsm_report_provider_show() fail to check for ops registration. Add the
missing checks for tsm_ops having been removed.

Now, in supporting the ability for tsm_unregister() to always succeed,
it leaves the problem of what to do with lingering config-items. The
expectation is that the admin that arranges for the ->remove() (unbind)
of the ${tsm_arch}-guest driver is also responsible for deletion of all
open config-items. Until that deletion happens, ->probe() (reload /
bind) of the ${tsm_arch}-guest driver fails.

This allows for emergency shutdown / revocation of attestation
interfaces, and requires coordinated restart."

RDMA/iwcm: Fix use-after-free of work objects after cm_id destruction

The commit 59c68ac31e15 (""iw_cm: free cm_id resources on the last
deref"") simplified cm_id resource management by freeing cm_id once all
references to the cm_id were removed. The references are removed either
upon completion of iw_cm event handlers or when the application destroys
the cm_id. This commit introduced the use-after-free condition where
cm_id_private object could still be in use by event handler works during
the destruction of cm_id. The commit aee2424246f9 (""RDMA/iwcm: Fix a
use-after-free related to destroying CM IDs"") addressed this use-after-
free by flushing all pending works at the cm_id destruction.

However, still another use-after-free possibility remained. It happens
with the work objects allocated for each cm_id_priv within
alloc_work_entries() during cm_id creation, and subsequently freed in
dealloc_work_entries() once all references to the cm_id are removed.
If the cm_id's last reference is decremented in the event handler work,
the work object for the work itself gets removed, and causes the use-
after-free BUG below:

The reason is that fb_info->var is being modified in fb_set_var(), and
then fb_videomode_to_var() is called. If it fails to add the mode to
fb_info->modelist, fb_set_var() returns error, but does not restore the
old value of fb_info->var. Restore fb_info->var on failure the same way
it is done earlier in the function.

Even though fbcon_init() checks beforehand if fb_match_mode() in
var_to_display() fails, it can not prevent the panic because fbcon_init()
does not return error code. Considering this and the comment in the code
about fb_match_mode() returning NULL - ""This should not happen"" - it is
better to prevent registering the fb_info if its mode was not set
successfully. Also move fb_add_videomode() closer to the beginning of
do_register_framebuffer() to avoid having to do the cleanup on fail.

hwmon: (ftsteutates) Fix TOCTOU race in fts_read()

In the fts_read() function, when handling hwmon_pwm_auto_channels_temp,
the code accesses the shared variable data->fan_source[channel] twice
without holding any locks. It is first checked against
FTS_FAN_SOURCE_INVALID, and if the check passes, it is read again
when used as an argument to the BIT() macro.

This creates a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition.
Another thread executing fts_update_device() can modify the value of
data->fan_source[channel] between the check and its use. If the value
is changed to FTS_FAN_SOURCE_INVALID (0xff) during this window, the
BIT() macro will be called with a large shift value (BIT(255)).
A bit shift by a value greater than or equal to the type width is
undefined behavior and can lead to a crash or incorrect values being
returned to userspace.

Fix this by reading data->fan_source[channel] into a local variable
once, eliminating the race condition. Additionally, add a bounds check
to ensure the value is less than BITS_PER_LONG before passing it to
the BIT() macro, making the code more robust against undefined behavior.

This possible bug was found by an experimental static analysis tool
developed by our team."

This occurs when processing a symlink inode from the orphan list. The
partial block zeroing code in the truncate path calls
ext4_dirty_journalled_data() -> folio_mark_dirty(). The latter calls
mapping->a_ops->dirty_folio(), but symlink inodes are not assigned an
a_ops vector in ext4, hence the crash.

To avoid this problem, update the ext4_dirty_journalled_data() helper to
only mark the folio dirty on regular files (for which a_ops is

When running the following code on an ext4 filesystem with inline_data
feature enabled, it will lead to the bug below.

        fd = open(""file1"", O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0666);
        ftruncate(fd, 30);

That happens because write_begin will succeed as when
ext4_generic_write_inline_data calls ext4_prepare_inline_data, pos + len
will be truncated, leading to ext4_prepare_inline_data parameter to be 6
instead of 0x10000000006.

Then, later when write_end is called, we hit:

        BUG_ON(pos + len > EXT4_I(inode)->i_inline_size);

at ext4_write_inline_data.

Fix it by using a loff_t type for the len parameter in
ext4_prepare_inline_data instead of an unsigned int.

CVE-2025-38224	2025-07-04T14:15:31.110	2025-07-08T16:18:53.607	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: kvaser_pciefd: refine error prone echo_skb_max handling logic

echo_skb_max should define the supported upper limit of echo_skb[]
allocated inside the netdevice's priv. The corresponding size value
provided by this driver to alloc_candev() is KVASER_PCIEFD_CAN_TX_MAX_COUNT
which is 17.

But later echo_skb_max is rounded up to the nearest power of two (for the
max case, that would be 32) and the tx/ack indices calculated further
during tx/rx may exceed the upper array boundary. Kasan reported this for
the ack case inside kvaser_pciefd_handle_ack_packet(), though the xmit
function has actually caught the same thing earlier.

Tx max count definitely matters for kvaser_pciefd_tx_avail(), but for seq
numbers' generation that's not the case - we're free to calculate them as
would be more convenient, not taking tx max count into account. The only
downside is that the size of echo_skb[] should correspond to the max seq
number (not tx max count), so in some situations a bit more memory would
be consumed than could be.

Thus make the size of the underlying echo_skb[] sufficient for the rounded
max tx value.

Only when the write operation of usb_bulk_msg() in dvb_usb_generic_rw()
succeeds and rlen is greater than 0, the read operation of usb_bulk_msg()
will be executed to read rlen bytes of data from the dvb device into the

In this case, although rlen is 1, the write operation failed which resulted
in the dvb read operation not being executed, and ultimately variable i was

Validate db_agheight, db_agwidth, and db_agstart in dbMount to catch
corrupted metadata early and avoid undefined behavior in dbAllocAG.
Limits are derived from L2LPERCTL, LPERCTL/MAXAG, and CTLTREESIZE:

- agheight: 0 to L2LPERCTL/2 (0 to 5) ensures shift
  (L2LPERCTL - 2*agheight) >= 0.
- agwidth: 1 to min(LPERCTL/MAXAG, 2^(L2LPERCTL - 2*agheight))

  - Ranges: 1-8 (agheight 0-3), 1-4 (agheight 4), 1 (agheight 5).
  - LPERCTL/MAXAG = 1024/128 = 8 limits leaves per AG;
    2^(10 - 2*agheight) prevents division to 0.

nfsd: Initialize ssc before laundromat_work to prevent NULL dereference

In nfs4_state_start_net(), laundromat_work may access nfsd_ssc through
nfs4_laundromat -> nfsd4_ssc_expire_umount. If nfsd_ssc isn't initialized,
this can cause NULL pointer dereference.

Normally the delayed start of laundromat_work allows sufficient time for
nfsd_ssc initialization to complete. However, when the kernel waits too
long for userspace responses (e.g. in nfs4_state_start_net ->
nfsd4_end_grace -> nfsd4_record_grace_done -> nfsd4_cld_grace_done ->
cld_pipe_upcall -> __cld_pipe_upcall -> wait_for_completion path), the
delayed work may start before nfsd_ssc initialization finishes.

Fix this by moving nfsd_ssc initialization before starting laundromat_work."

sched/rt: Fix race in push_rt_task

Overview
========
When a CPU chooses to call push_rt_task and picks a task to push to
another CPU's runqueue then it will call find_lock_lowest_rq method
which would take a double lock on both CPUs' runqueues. If one of the
locks aren't readily available, it may lead to dropping the current
runqueue lock and reacquiring both the locks at once. During this window
it is possible that the task is already migrated and is running on some
other CPU. These cases are already handled. However, if the task is
migrated and has already been executed and another CPU is now trying to
wake it up (ttwu) such that it is queued again on the runqeue
(on_rq is 1) and also if the task was run by the same CPU, then the
current checks will pass even though the task was migrated out and is no
longer in the pushable tasks list.

Crashes
=======
This bug resulted in quite a few flavors of crashes triggering kernel
panics with various crash signatures such as assert failures, page
faults, null pointer dereferences, and queue corruption errors all
coming from scheduler itself.

CVE-2025-46733	2025-07-04T14:15:33.217	2025-07-08T16:18:53.607	OP-TEE is a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) designed as companion to a non-secure Linux kernel running on Arm; Cortex-A cores using the TrustZone technology. In version 4.5.0, using a specially crafted tee-supplicant binary running in REE userspace, an attacker can trigger a panic in a TA that uses the libutee Secure Storage API. Many functions in libutee, specifically those which make up the Secure Storage API, will panic if a system call returns an unexpected return code. This behavior is mandated by the TEE Internal Core API specification. However, in OP-TEE’s implementation, return codes of secure storage operations are passed through unsanitized from the REE tee-supplicant, through the Linux kernel tee-driver, through the OP-TEE kernel, back to libutee. Thus, an attacker with access to REE userspace, and the ability to stop tee-supplicant and replace it with their own process (generally trivial for a root user, and depending on the way permissions are set up, potentially available even to less privileged users) can run a malicious tee-supplicant process that responds to storage requests with unexpected response codes, triggering a panic in the requesting TA. This is particularly dangerous for TAs built with `TA_FLAG_SINGLE_INSTANCE` (corresponding to `gpd.ta.singleInstance` and `TA_FLAG_INSTANCE_KEEP_ALIVE` (corresponding to `gpd.ta.keepAlive`). The behavior of these TAs may depend on memory that is preserved between sessions, and the ability of an attacker to panic the TA and reload it with a clean memory space can compromise the behavior of those TAs. A critical example of this is the optee_ftpm TA. It uses the kept alive memory to hold PCR values, which crucially must be non-resettable. An attacker who can trigger a panic in the fTPM TA can reset the PCRs, and then extend them PCRs with whatever they choose, falsifying boot measurements, accessing sealed data, and potentially more. The impact of this issue depends significantly on the behavior of affected TAs. For some, it could manifest as a denial of service, while for others, like the fTPM TA, it can result in the disclosure of sensitive data. Anyone running the fTPM TA is affected, but similar attacks may be possible on other TAs that leverage the Secure Storage API. A fix is available in commit 941a58d78c99c4754fbd4ec3079ec9e1d596af8f.	7.9	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L		
CVE-2025-49600	2025-07-04T15:15:22.277	2025-07-17T15:59:03.633	In MbedTLS 3.3.0 before 3.6.4, mbedtls_lms_verify may accept invalid signatures if hash computation fails and internal errors go unchecked, enabling LMS (Leighton-Micali Signature) forgery in a fault scenario. Specifically, unchecked return values in mbedtls_lms_verify allow an attacker (who can induce a hardware hash accelerator fault) to bypass LMS signature verification by reusing stale stack data, resulting in acceptance of an invalid signature. In mbedtls_lms_verify, the return values of the internal Merkle tree functions create_merkle_leaf_value and create_merkle_internal_value are not checked. These functions return an integer that indicates whether the call succeeded or not. If a failure occurs, the output buffer (Tc_candidate_root_node) may remain uninitialized, and the result of the signature verification is unpredictable. When the software implementation of SHA-256 is used, these functions will not fail. However, with hardware-accelerated hashing, an attacker could use fault injection against the accelerator to bypass verification.	4.9	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2025-49601	2025-07-04T15:15:22.467	2025-07-17T16:00:02.243	In MbedTLS 3.3.0 before 3.6.4, mbedtls_lms_import_public_key does not check that the input buffer is at least 4 bytes before reading a 32-bit field, allowing a possible out-of-bounds read on truncated input. Specifically, an out-of-bounds read in mbedtls_lms_import_public_key allows context-dependent attackers to trigger a crash or limited adjacent-memory disclosure by supplying a truncated LMS (Leighton-Micali Signature) public-key buffer under four bytes. An LMS public key starts with a 4-byte type indicator. The function mbedtls_lms_import_public_key reads this type indicator before validating the size of its input.	4.8	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L

Prior to version 25.6.7, a vulnerability in the authentication logic allows users to bypass password verification using SHA-256 magic hashes, due to loose comparison in PHP. In vulnerable versions of the application, a password comparison is performed using the `==` operator at line 40 in front/index.php. This introduces a security issue where specially crafted ""magic hash"" values that evaluate to true in a loose comparison can bypass authentication. Because of the use of `==` instead of the strict `===`, different strings that begin with 0e and are followed by only digits can be interpreted as scientific notation (i.e., zero) and treated as equal. This issue falls under the Login Bypass vulnerability class. Users with certain ""weird"" passwords that produce magic hashes are particularly affected.

HID: appletb-kbd: fix ""appletb_backlight"" backlight device reference counting

During appletb_kbd_probe, probe attempts to get the backlight device
by name. When this happens backlight_device_get_by_name looks for a
device in the backlight class which has name ""appletb_backlight"" and
upon finding a match it increments the reference count for the device
and returns it to the caller. However this reference is never released
leading to a reference leak.

Fix this by decrementing the backlight device reference count on removal

CVE-2025-38236	2025-07-08T08:15:20.960	2025-10-02T14:15:43.583	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_unix: Don't leave consecutive consumed OOB skbs.

Jann Horn reported a use-after-free in unix_stream_read_generic().

The following sequences reproduce the issue:

  $ python3
  from socket import *
  s1, s2 = socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM)
  s1.send(b'x', MSG_OOB)
  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # leave a consumed OOB skb
  s1.send(b'y', MSG_OOB)
  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # leave a consumed OOB skb
  s1.send(b'z', MSG_OOB)
  s2.recv(1)              # recv 'z' illegally
  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # access 'z' skb (use-after-free)

Even though a user reads OOB data, the skb holding the data stays on
the recv queue to mark the OOB boundary and break the next recv().

After the last send() in the scenario above, the sk2's recv queue has
2 leading consumed OOB skbs and 1 real OOB skb.

Then, the following happens during the next recv() without MSG_OOB

  1. unix_stream_read_generic() peeks the first consumed OOB skb
  2. manage_oob() returns the next consumed OOB skb
  3. unix_stream_read_generic() fetches the next not-yet-consumed OOB skb
  4. unix_stream_read_generic() reads and frees the OOB skb

, and the last recv(MSG_OOB) triggers KASAN splat.

The 3. above occurs because of the SO_PEEK_OFF code, which does not
expect unix_skb_len(skb) to be 0, but this is true for such consumed
OOB skbs.

  while (skip >= unix_skb_len(skb)) {
    skip -= unix_skb_len(skb);
    skb = skb_peek_next(skb, &sk->sk_receive_queue);
    ...
  }

In addition to this use-after-free, there is another issue that
ioctl(SIOCATMARK) does not function properly with consecutive consumed
OOB skbs.

So, nothing good comes out of such a situation.

Instead of complicating manage_oob(), ioctl() handling, and the next
ECONNRESET fix by introducing a loop for consecutive consumed OOB skbs,
let's not leave such consecutive OOB unnecessarily.

Now, while receiving an OOB skb in unix_stream_recv_urg(), if its
previous skb is a consumed OOB skb, it is freed.

CVE-2025-48384	2025-07-08T19:15:42.800	2025-08-26T14:45:27.957	Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When reading a config value, Git strips any trailing carriage return and line feed (CRLF). When writing a config entry, values with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be lost when the config is later read. When initializing a submodule, if the submodule path contains a trailing CR, the altered path is read resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect location. If a symlink exists that points the altered path to the submodule hooks directory, and the submodule contains an executable post-checkout hook, the script may be unintentionally executed after checkout. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.	8.0	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2025-48385	2025-07-08T19:15:43.097	2025-07-10T13:18:53.830	Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When cloning a repository Git knows to optionally fetch a bundle advertised by the remote server, which allows the server-side to offload parts of the clone to a CDN. The Git client does not perform sufficient validation of the advertised bundles, which allows the remote side to perform protocol injection. This protocol injection can cause the client to write the fetched bundle to a location controlled by the adversary. The fetched content is fully controlled by the server, which can in the worst case lead to arbitrary code execution. The use of bundle URIs is not enabled by default and can be controlled by the bundle.heuristic config option. Some cases of the vulnerability require that the adversary is in control of where a repository will be cloned to. This either requires social engineering or a recursive clone with submodules. These cases can thus be avoided by disabling recursive clones. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.

CVE-2025-53547	2025-07-08T22:15:27.897	2025-09-03T16:26:24.770	Helm is a package manager for Charts for Kubernetes. Prior to 3.18.4, a specially crafted Chart.yaml file along with a specially linked Chart.lock file can lead to local code execution when dependencies are updated. Fields in a Chart.yaml file, that are carried over to a Chart.lock file when dependencies are updated and this file is written, can be crafted in a way that can cause execution if that same content were in a file that is executed (e.g., a bash.rc file or shell script). If the Chart.lock file is symlinked to one of these files updating dependencies will write the lock file content to the symlinked file. This can lead to unwanted execution. Helm warns of the symlinked file but did not stop execution due to symlinking. This issue has been resolved in Helm v3.18.4.	8.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H

The reason is simple, readahead brought some order 0 folio in swap cache,
and the swapin mTHP folio being allocated is in conflict with it, so
swapcache_prepare fails and causes shmem_swap_alloc_folio to return
-EEXIST, and shmem simply retries again and again causing this loop.

Fix it by applying a similar fix for anon mTHP swapin.

The performance change is very slight, time of swapin 10g zero folios
with shmem (test for 12 times):
Before:  2.47s
After:   2.48s

CVE-2025-38242	2025-07-09T11:15:26.233	2025-07-10T15:15:26.957	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: userfaultfd: fix race of userfaultfd_move and swap cache

This commit fixes two kinds of races, they may have different results:

Barry reported a BUG_ON in commit c50f8e6053b0, we may see the same
BUG_ON if the filemap lookup returned NULL and folio is added to swap
cache after that.

If another kind of race is triggered (folio changed after lookup) we
may see RSS counter is corrupted:

[  406.893936] BUG: Bad rss-counter state mm:ffff0000c5a9ddc0
type:MM_ANONPAGES val:-1
[  406.894071] BUG: Bad rss-counter state mm:ffff0000c5a9ddc0
type:MM_SHMEMPAGES val:1

Because the folio is being accounted to the wrong VMA.

I'm not sure if there will be any data corruption though, seems no. 
The issues above are critical already.


On seeing a swap entry PTE, userfaultfd_move does a lockless swap cache
lookup, and tries to move the found folio to the faulting vma.  Currently,
it relies on checking the PTE value to ensure that the moved folio still
belongs to the src swap entry and that no new folio has been added to the
swap cache, which turns out to be unreliable.

While working and reviewing the swap table series with Barry, following
existing races are observed and reproduced [1]:

In the example below, move_pages_pte is moving src_pte to dst_pte, where
src_pte is a swap entry PTE holding swap entry S1, and S1 is not in the
swap cache:

CPU1                               CPU2
userfaultfd_move
  move_pages_pte()
    entry = pte_to_swp_entry(orig_src_pte);
    // Here it got entry = S1
    ... < interrupted> ...
                                   <swapin src_pte, alloc and use folio A>
                                   // folio A is a new allocated folio
                                   // and get installed into src_pte
                                   <frees swap entry S1>
                                   // src_pte now points to folio A, S1
                                   // has swap count == 0, it can be freed
                                   // by folio_swap_swap or swap
                                   // allocator's reclaim.
                                   <try to swap out another folio B>
                                   // folio B is a folio in another VMA.
                                   <put folio B to swap cache using S1 >
                                   // S1 is freed, folio B can use it
                                   // for swap out with no problem.
                                   ...
    folio = filemap_get_folio(S1)
    // Got folio B here !!!
    ... < interrupted again> ...
                                   <swapin folio B and free S1>
                                   // Now S1 is free to be used again.
                                   <swapout src_pte & folio A using S1>
                                   // Now src_pte is a swap entry PTE
                                   // holding S1 again.
    folio_trylock(folio)
    move_swap_pte
      double_pt_lock
      is_pte_pages_stable
      // Check passed because src_pte == S1
      folio_move_anon_rmap(...)
      // Moved invalid folio B here !!!

The race window is very short and requires multiple collisions of multiple
rare events, so it's very unlikely to happen, but with a deliberately
constructed reproducer and increased time window, it can be reproduced
easily.

This can be fixed by checking if the folio returned by filemap is the
valid swap cache folio after acquiring the folio lock.

Another similar race is possible: filemap_get_folio may return NULL, but
folio (A) could be swapped in and then swapped out again using the same
swap entry after the lookup.  In such a case, folio (A) may remain in the
swap cache, so it must be moved too:

CPU1                               CPU2
userfaultfd_move
  move_pages_pte()
    entry = pte_to_swp_entry(orig_src_pte);
    // Here it got entry = S1, and S1 is not in swap cache
    folio = filemap_get

CVE-2025-38245	2025-07-09T11:15:26.597	2025-07-17T17:15:38.150	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

atm: Release atm_dev_mutex after removing procfs in atm_dev_deregister().

syzbot reported a warning below during atm_dev_register(). [0]

Before creating a new device and procfs/sysfs for it, atm_dev_register()
looks up a duplicated device by __atm_dev_lookup().  These operations are
done under atm_dev_mutex.

However, when removing a device in atm_dev_deregister(), it releases the
mutex just after removing the device from the list that __atm_dev_lookup()
iterates over.

So, there will be a small race window where the device does not exist on
the device list but procfs/sysfs are still not removed, triggering the
splat.

Let's hold the mutex until procfs/sysfs are removed in
atm_dev_deregister().

CVE-2025-38248	2025-07-09T11:15:26.963	2025-07-10T13:17:30.017	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bridge: mcast: Fix use-after-free during router port configuration

The bridge maintains a global list of ports behind which a multicast
router resides. The list is consulted during forwarding to ensure
multicast packets are forwarded to these ports even if the ports are not
member in the matching MDB entry.

When per-VLAN multicast snooping is enabled, the per-port multicast
context is disabled on each port and the port is removed from the global
router port list:

 # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1
 # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy
 # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2
 $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router
 router ports on br1: dummy1
 # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 1
 $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router

However, the port can be re-added to the global list even when per-VLAN
multicast snooping is enabled:

 # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 0
 # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2
 $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router
 router ports on br1: dummy1

Since commit 4b30ae9adb04 (""net: bridge: mcast: re-implement
br_multicast_{enable, disable}_port functions""), when per-VLAN multicast
snooping is enabled, multicast disablement on a port will disable the
per-{port, VLAN} multicast contexts and not the per-port one. As a
result, a port will remain in the global router port list even after it
is deleted. This will lead to a use-after-free [1] when the list is
traversed (when adding a new port to the list, for example):

 # ip link del dev dummy1
 # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy
 # ip link set dev dummy2 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2

Similarly, stale entries can also be found in the per-VLAN router port
list. When per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled, the per-{port, VLAN}
contexts are disabled on each port and the port is removed from the
per-VLAN router port list:

 # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1 mcast_vlan_snooping 1
 # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy
 # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy1
 # bridge vlan global set vid 2 dev br1 mcast_snooping 1
 # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2
 $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router
       router ports: dummy1
 # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 0
 $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router

However, the port can be re-added to the per-VLAN list even when
per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled:

 # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 0
 # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2
 $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router
       router ports: dummy1

When the VLAN is deleted from the port, the per-{port, VLAN} multicast
context will not be disabled since multicast snooping is not enabled
on the VLAN. As a result, the port will remain in the per-VLAN router
port list even after it is no longer member in the VLAN. This will lead
to a use-after-free [2] when the list is traversed (when adding a new
port to the list, for example):

 # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy
 # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy2
 # bridge vlan del vid 2 dev dummy1
 # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy2 mcast_router 2

Fix these issues by removing the port from the relevant (global or
per-VLAN) router port list in br_multicast_port_ctx_deinit(). The
function is invoked during port deletion with the per-port multicast
context and during VLAN deletion with the per-{port, VLAN} multicast
context.

Note that deleting the multicast router timer is not enough as it only
takes care of the temporary multicast router states (1 or 3) and not the
permanent one (2).

ALSA: usb-audio: Fix out-of-bounds read in snd_usb_get_audioformat_uac3()

In snd_usb_get_audioformat_uac3(), the length value returned from
snd_usb_ctl_msg() is used directly for memory allocation without
validation. This length is controlled by the USB device.

The allocated buffer is cast to a uac3_cluster_header_descriptor
and its fields are accessed without verifying that the buffer
is large enough. If the device returns a smaller than expected
length, this leads to an out-of-bounds read.

Add a length check to ensure the buffer is large enough for
uac3_cluster_header_descriptor."					
CVE-2025-38250	2025-07-09T11:15:27.193	2025-07-10T15:15:27.517	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_core: Fix use-after-free in vhci_flush()

syzbot reported use-after-free in vhci_flush() without repro. [0]

From the splat, a thread close()d a vhci file descriptor while
its device was being used by iotcl() on another thread.

Once the last fd refcnt is released, vhci_release() calls
hci_unregister_dev(), hci_free_dev(), and kfree() for struct
vhci_data, which is set to hci_dev->dev->driver_data.

The problem is that there is no synchronisation after unlinking
hdev from hci_dev_list in hci_unregister_dev().  There might be
another thread still accessing the hdev which was fetched before
the unlink operation.

We can use SRCU for such synchronisation.

Let's run hci_dev_reset() under SRCU and wait for its completion
in hci_unregister_dev().

Another option would be to restore hci_dev->destruct(), which was
removed in commit 587ae086f6e4 (""Bluetooth: Remove unused
hci-destruct cb"").  However, this would not be a good solution, as
we should not run hci_unregister_dev() while there are in-flight
ioctl() requests, which could lead to another data-race KCSAN splat.

Note that other drivers seem to have the same problem, for exmaple,
virtbt_remove().

cxl/ras: Fix CPER handler device confusion

By inspection, cxl_cper_handle_prot_err() is making a series of fragile

1/ It assumes that endpoints identified in the record are a CXL-type-3
   device, nothing guarantees that.

2/ It assumes that the device is bound to the cxl_pci driver, nothing
   guarantees that.

3/ Minor, it holds the device lock over the switch-port tracing for no
   reason as the trace is 100% generated from data in the record.

Correct those by checking that the PCIe endpoint parents a cxl_memdev

it is required. Consequently this also makes the implementation ready for
CXL accelerators that are not bound to cxl_pci."

[CAUSE]
Firstly the fs has a corrupted csum tree root, thus to mount the fs we
have to go ""ro,rescue=ibadroots"" mount option.

Normally with that mount option, a bad csum tree root should set
BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DATA_CSUMS flag, so that any future data read will
ignore csum search.

But in this particular case, we have the following call trace that
caused NULL csum root, but not setting BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DATA_CSUMS:

load_global_roots_objectid():

		ret = btrfs_search_slot();
		/* Succeeded */
		btrfs_item_key_to_cpu()
		found = true;
		/* We found the root item for csum tree. */
		root = read_tree_root_path();
		if (IS_ERR(root)) {
			if (!btrfs_test_opt(fs_info, IGNOREBADROOTS))
			/*
			 * Since we have rescue=ibadroots mount option,
			 * @ret is still 0.
			 */
			break;
	if (!found || ret) {
		/* @found is true, @ret is 0, error handling for csum
		 * tree is skipped.
		 */
	}

This means we completely skipped to set BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DATA_CSUMS if
the csum tree is corrupted, which results unexpected later csum lookup.

[FIX]
If read_tree_root_path() failed, always populate @ret to the error
number.

As at the end of the function, we need @ret to determine if we need to
do the extra error handling for csum tree."

The issue comes from the put_user() in schedule_tail
(kernel/sched/core.c) doing the following:

asmlinkage __visible void schedule_tail(struct task_struct *prev)
{
...
        if (current->set_child_tid)
                put_user(task_pid_vnr(current), current->set_child_tid);
...
}

the put_user() macro causes the code sequence to come out as follows:

1:	__enable_user_access()
2:	reg = task_pid_vnr(current);
3:	*current->set_child_tid = reg;
4:	__disable_user_access()

The problem is that we may have a sleeping function as argument which
could clear SR_SUM causing the panic above. This was fixed by
evaluating the argument of the put_user() macro outside the user-enabled
section in commit 285a76bb2cf5 (""riscv: evaluate put_user() arg before
enabling user access"")""

In order for riscv to take advantage of unsafe_get/put_XXX() macros and
to avoid the same issue we had with put_user() and sleeping functions we
must ensure code flow can go through switch_to() from within a region of
code with SR_SUM enabled and come back with SR_SUM still enabled. This
patch addresses the problem allowing future work to enable full use of
unsafe_get/put_XXX() macros without needing to take a CSR bit flip cost
on every access. Make switch_to() save and restore SR_SUM."

CVE-2025-38266	2025-07-10T08:15:24.727	2025-07-10T13:17:30.017	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pinctrl: mediatek: eint: Fix invalid pointer dereference for v1 platforms

Commit 3ef9f710efcb (""pinctrl: mediatek: Add EINT support for multiple
addresses"") introduced an access to the 'soc' field of struct
mtk_pinctrl in mtk_eint_do_init() and for that an include of
pinctrl-mtk-common-v2.h.

However, pinctrl drivers relying on the v1 common driver include
pinctrl-mtk-common.h instead, which provides another definition of
struct mtk_pinctrl that does not contain an 'soc' field.

Since mtk_eint_do_init() can be called both by v1 and v2 drivers, it
will now try to dereference an invalid pointer when called on v1
platforms. This has been observed on Genio 350 EVK (MT8365), which
crashes very early in boot (the kernel trace can only be seen with
earlycon).

In order to fix this, since 'struct mtk_pinctrl' was only needed to get
a 'struct mtk_eint_pin', make 'struct mtk_eint_pin' a parameter
of mtk_eint_do_init() so that callers need to supply it, removing
mtk_eint_do_init()'s dependency on any particular 'struct mtk_pinctrl'."					
CVE-2025-38267	2025-07-10T08:15:24.833	2025-07-10T13:17:30.017	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ring-buffer: Do not trigger WARN_ON() due to a commit_overrun

When reading a memory mapped buffer the reader page is just swapped out
with the last page written in the write buffer. If the reader page is the
same as the commit buffer (the buffer that is currently being written to)
it was assumed that it should never have missed events. If it does, it
triggers a WARN_ON_ONCE().

But there just happens to be one scenario where this can legitimately
happen. That is on a commit_overrun. A commit overrun is when an interrupt
preempts an event being written to the buffer and then the interrupt adds
so many new events that it fills and wraps the buffer back to the commit.
Any new events would then be dropped and be reported as ""missed_events"".

In this case, the next page to read is the commit buffer and after the
swap of the reader page, the reader page will be the commit buffer, but
this time there will be missed events and this triggers the following
warning:

usb: typec: tcpm: move tcpm_queue_vdm_unlocked to asynchronous work

A state check was previously added to tcpm_queue_vdm_unlocked to
prevent a deadlock where the DisplayPort Alt Mode driver would be
executing work and attempting to grab the tcpm_lock while the TCPM
was holding the lock and attempting to unregister the altmode, blocking
on the altmode driver's cancel_work_sync call.

Because the state check isn't protected, there is a small window
where the Alt Mode driver could determine that the TCPM is
in a ready state and attempt to grab the lock while the
TCPM grabs the lock and changes the TCPM state to one that
causes the deadlock. The callstack is provided below:

The recently added get_net() call in commit e279024617134 (""net/tipc:

fs/dax: Fix ""don't skip locked entries when scanning entries""

Commit 6be3e21d25ca (""fs/dax: don't skip locked entries when scanning
entries"") introduced a new function, wait_entry_unlocked_exclusive(),
which waits for the current entry to become unlocked without advancing
the XArray iterator state.

Waiting for the entry to become unlocked requires dropping the XArray
lock. This requires calling xas_pause() prior to dropping the lock
which leaves the xas in a suitable state for the next iteration. However
this has the side-effect of advancing the xas state to the next index.
Normally this isn't an issue because xas_for_each() contains code to
detect this state and thus avoid advancing the index a second time on
the next loop iteration.

However both callers of and wait_entry_unlocked_exclusive() itself
subsequently use the xas state to reload the entry. As xas_pause()
updated the state to the next index this will cause the current entry
which is being waited on to be skipped. This caused the following
warning to fire intermittently when running xftest generic/068 on an XFS
filesystem with FS DAX enabled:

mtd: nand: ecc-mxic: Fix use of uninitialized variable ret

If ctx->steps is zero, the loop processing ECC steps is skipped,
and the variable ret remains uninitialized. It is later checked
and returned, which leads to undefined behavior and may cause
unpredictable results in user space or kernel crashes.

This scenario can be triggered in edge cases such as misconfigured
geometry, ECC engine misuse, or if ctx->steps is not validated
after initialization.

Initialize ret to zero before the loop to ensure correct and safe
behavior regardless of the ctx->steps value.

octeontx2-pf: QOS: Refactor TC_HTB_LEAF_DEL_LAST callback

This patch addresses below issues,

1. Active traffic on the leaf node must be stopped before its send queue
   is reassigned to the parent. This patch resolves the issue by marking
   the node as 'Inner'.

2. During a system reboot, the interface receives TC_HTB_LEAF_DEL
   and TC_HTB_LEAF_DEL_LAST callbacks to delete its HTB queues.
   In the case of TC_HTB_LEAF_DEL_LAST, although the same send queue
   is reassigned to the parent, the current logic still attempts to update
   the real number of queues, leadning to below warnings

kernfs: Relax constraint in draining guard

The active reference lifecycle provides the break/unbreak mechanism but
the active reference is not truly active after unbreak -- callers don't
use it afterwards but it's important for proper pairing of kn->active
counting. Assuming this mechanism is in place, the WARN check in
kernfs_should_drain_open_files() is too sensitive -- it may transiently
catch those (rightful) callers between
kernfs_unbreak_active_protection() and kernfs_put_active() as found out by Chen
Ridong:

	kernfs_remove_by_name_ns	kernfs_get_active // active=1
	__kernfs_remove					  // active=0x80000002

					kernfs_unbreak_active_protection
					// active = 0x80000002
	...
	kernfs_should_drain_open_files
	// warning occurs
					kernfs_put_active

To avoid the false positives (mind panic_on_warn) remove the check altogether.
(This is meant as quick fix, I think active reference break/unbreak may be
simplified with larger rework.)"

The issue arose was because the variable 'adxl_component_count' (inside
skx_edac_common), which counts the ADXL components, was not reset. During
the reloading of i10nm_edac, the count was incremented by the actual number
of ADXL components again, resulting in a count that was double the real
number of ADXL components. This led to an out-of-bounds reference to the
ADXL component array, causing the general protection fault above.

Fix this issue by resetting the 'adxl_component_count' in adxl_put(),
which is called during the unloading of {skx,i10nm}_edac."

ptp: remove ptp->n_vclocks check logic in ptp_vclock_in_use()

There is no disagreement that we should check both ptp->is_virtual_clock

However, when we acquire ptp->n_vclocks_mux to read ptp->n_vclocks in

....
============================================

The best way to solve this is to remove the logic that checks
ptp->n_vclocks in ptp_vclock_in_use().

The reason why this is appropriate is that any path that uses
ptp->n_vclocks must unconditionally check if ptp->n_vclocks is greater
than 0 before unregistering vclocks, and all functions are already
written this way. And in the function that uses ptp->n_vclocks, we
already get ptp->n_vclocks_mux before unregistering vclocks.

Therefore, we need to remove the redundant check for ptp->n_vclocks in
ptp_vclock_in_use() to prevent recursive locking."

iavf: get rid of the crit lock

Get rid of the crit lock.
That frees us from the error prone logic of try_locks.

Thanks to netdev_lock() by Jakub it is now easy, and in most cases we were
protected by it already - replace crit lock by netdev lock when it was not
the case.

Lockdep reports that we should cancel the work under crit_lock [splat1],
and that was the scheme we have mostly followed since [1] by Slawomir.
But when that is done we still got into deadlocks [splat2]. So instead
we should look at the bigger problem, namely ""weird locking/scheduling""
of the iavf. The first step to fix that is to remove the crit lock.
I will followup with a -next series that simplifies scheduling/tasks.

Cancel the work without netdev lock (weird unlock+lock scheme),
to fix the [splat2] (which would be totally ugly if we would kept
the crit lock).

Extend protected part of iavf_watchdog_task() to include scheduling
more work.

Note that the removed comment in iavf_reset_task() was misplaced,
it belonged to inside of the removed if condition, so it's gone now.

This issue seems to be related to the behavior of some gcc compilers and
was also fixed on the s390 architecture before:

 commit d93a855c31b7 (""s390/ptrace: Avoid KASAN false positives in regs_get_kernel_stack_nth()"")

As described in that commit, regs_get_kernel_stack_nth() has confirmed that
`addr` is on the stack, so reading the value at `*addr` should be allowed.
Use READ_ONCE_NOCHECK() helper to silence the KASAN check for this case.

It is desireable to push the hardware accelerator to also

Without this quirk the driver becomes unstable and lock
up and and crash.

I do not know exactly why, but it is probably due to the
TOE (TCP offload engine) feature that is coupled with the
segmentation feature - it is not possible to turn one
part off and not the other, either both TOE and TSO are
active, or neither of them.

Not having the TOE part active seems detrimental, as if
that hardware feature is not really supposed to be turned
off.

The datasheet says:

  ""Based on packet parsing and TCP connection/NAT table
   lookup results, the NetEngine puts the packets
   belonging to the same TCP connection to the same queue
   for the software to process. The NetEngine puts
   incoming packets to the buffer or series of buffers

x86/sgx: Prevent attempts to reclaim poisoned pages

TL;DR: SGX page reclaim touches the page to copy its contents to
secondary storage. SGX instructions do not gracefully handle machine
checks. Despite this, the existing SGX code will try to reclaim pages
that it _knows_ are poisoned. Avoid even trying to reclaim poisoned pages.

The longer story:

Pages used by an enclave only get epc_page->poison set in
arch_memory_failure() but they currently stay on sgx_active_page_list until
sgx_encl_release(), with the SGX_EPC_PAGE_RECLAIMER_TRACKED flag untouched.

epc_page->poison is not checked in the reclaimer logic meaning that, if other
conditions are met, an attempt will be made to reclaim an EPC page that was
poisoned.  This is bad because 1. we don't want that page to end up added
to another enclave and 2. it is likely to cause one core to shut down
and the kernel to panic.

Specifically, reclaiming uses microcode operations including ""EWB"" which
accesses the EPC page contents to encrypt and write them out to non-SGX
memory.  Those operations cannot handle MCEs in their accesses other than
by putting the executing core into a special shutdown state (affecting
both threads with HT.)  The kernel will subsequently panic on the
remaining cores seeing the core didn't enter MCE handler(s) in time.

Call sgx_unmark_page_reclaimable() to remove the affected EPC page from
sgx_active_page_list on memory error to stop it being considered for
reclaiming.

Testing epc_page->poison in sgx_reclaim_pages() would also work but I assume
it's better to add code in the less likely paths.

The affected EPC page is not added to &node->sgx_poison_page_list until
later in sgx_encl_release()->sgx_free_epc_page() when it is EREMOVEd.
Membership on other lists doesn't change to avoid changing any of the
lists' semantics except for sgx_active_page_list.  There's a ""TBD"" comment
in arch_memory_failure() about pre-emptive actions, the goal here is not
to address everything that it may imply.

This also doesn't completely close the time window when a memory error
notification will be fatal (for a not previously poisoned EPC page) --
the MCE can happen after sgx_reclaim_pages() has selected its candidates
or even *inside* a microcode operation (actually easy to trigger due to
the amount of time spent in them.)

The spinlock in sgx_unmark_page_reclaimable() is safe because
memory_failure() runs in process context and no spinlocks are held,
explicitly noted in a mm/memory-failure.c comment."

fs/nfs/read: fix double-unlock bug in nfs_return_empty_folio()

Sometimes, when a file was read while it was being truncated by
another NFS client, the kernel could deadlock because folio_unlock()
was called twice, and the second call would XOR back the `PG_locked`
flag.

Most of the time (depending on the timing of the truncation), nobody
notices the problem because folio_unlock() gets called three times,
which flips `PG_locked` back off:

 1. vfs_read, nfs_read_folio, ... nfs_read_add_folio,
    nfs_return_empty_folio
 2. vfs_read, nfs_read_folio, ... netfs_read_collection,
    netfs_unlock_abandoned_read_pages
 3. vfs_read, ... nfs_do_read_folio, nfs_read_add_folio,
    nfs_return_empty_folio

The problem is that nfs_read_add_folio() is not supposed to unlock the
folio if fscache is enabled, and a nfs_netfs_folio_unlock() check is
missing in nfs_return_empty_folio().

Rarely this leads to a warning in netfs_read_collection():

ACPICA: fix acpi parse and parseext cache leaks

ACPICA commit 8829e70e1360c81e7a5a901b5d4f48330e021ea5

I'm Seunghun Han, and I work for National Security Research Institute of
South Korea.

I have been doing a research on ACPI and found an ACPI cache leak in ACPI
early abort cases.

Boot log of ACPI cache leak is as follows:

I analyzed this memory leak in detail. I found that “Acpi-State” cache and
“Acpi-Parse” cache were merged because the size of cache objects was same
slab cache size.

I finally found “Acpi-Parse” cache and “Acpi-parse_ext” cache were leaked
using SLAB_NEVER_MERGE flag in kmem_cache_create() function.

ACPICA: fix acpi operand cache leak in dswstate.c

ACPICA commit 987a3b5cf7175916e2a4b6ea5b8e70f830dfe732

I found an ACPI cache leak in ACPI early termination and boot continuing case.

terminates ACPI function and continues to boot process. While kernel terminates
ACPI function, kmem_cache_destroy() reports Acpi-Operand cache leak.

I analyzed this memory leak in detail and found acpi_ds_obj_stack_pop_and_
delete() function miscalculated the top of the stack. acpi_ds_obj_stack_push()
function uses walk_state->operand_index for start position of the top, but
acpi_ds_obj_stack_pop_and_delete() function considers index 0 for it.
Therefore, this causes acpi operand memory leak.

This cache leak causes a security threat because an old kernel (<= 4.9) shows
memory locations of kernel functions in stack dump. Some malicious users
could use this information to neutralize kernel ASLR.

I made a patch to fix ACPI operand cache leak."

The above issue may happen as follows:

(2) insmod test.ko;
(3)  Module triggers ftrace disabled;
(4) rmmod test.ko;
(5) cat /proc/kallsyms; --> Will trigger UAF as test.ko already removed;
ftrace_mod_get_kallsym()
...
strscpy(module_name, mod_map->mod->name, MODULE_NAME_LEN);
...

The problem is when a module triggers an issue with ftrace and
sets ftrace_disable. The ftrace_disable is set when an anomaly is
discovered and to prevent any more damage, ftrace stops all text
modification. The issue that happened was that the ftrace_disable stops
more than just the text modification.

When a module is loaded, its init functions can also be traced. Because
kallsyms deletes the init functions after a module has loaded, ftrace
saves them when the module is loaded and function tracing is enabled. This
allows the output of the function trace to show the init function names
instead of just their raw memory addresses.

When a module is removed, ftrace_release_mod() is called, and if
ftrace_disable is set, it just returns without doing anything more. The
problem here is that it leaves the mod_list still around and if kallsyms
is called, it will call into this code and access the module memory that
has already been freed as it will return:

  strscpy(module_name, mod_map->mod->name, MODULE_NAME_LEN);

The eeprom->v{1,2}.len is set by the driver in p54_download_eeprom().
The device is supposed to provide the same length back to the driver.
But yes, it's possible (like shown in the report) to alter the value
to something that causes a crash/panic due to overrun.

This patch addresses the issue by adding the size to the common device
context, so p54_rx_eeprom_readback no longer relies on possibly tampered
values... That said, it also checks if the ""firmware"" altered the value
and no longer copies them.

The one, small saving grace is: Before the driver tries to read the eeprom,
it needs to upload >a< firmware. the vendor firmware has a proprietary

When RIB sharding is enabled and a user executes one of several routing related 'show' commands, a certain amount of memory is leaked. When all available memory has been consumed rpd will crash and restart.

The leak can be monitored with the CLI command:



show task memory detail | match task_shard_mgmt_cookie



where the allocated memory in bytes can be seen to continuously increase with each exploitation.

The write target is derived from an unvalidated UEFI NVRAM variable (SetupXtuBufferAddress), while the write content is read from an attacker-controlled pointer based on the RBX register. This dual-pointer dereference enables arbitrary memory writes within System Management RAM (SMRAM), leading to potential SMM privilege escalation and firmware compromise.	8.2	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

This pointer is passed unchecked into multiple flash management functions (ReadFlash, WriteFlash, EraseFlash, and GetFlashInfo) that dereference both the structure and its nested members, such as BufAddr. This enables arbitrary read/write access to System Management RAM (SMRAM), allowing an attacker to corrupt firmware memory, exfiltrate SMRAM content via flash, or install persistent implants.	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Given that there are SNR measurements attributed to each received transmission, this is a guaranteed way to get a remote station to reliably and continuously respond. You could easily get 100 samples in a short amount of time (estimated 2 minutes), whereas passively doing the same could take hours or days. There are secondary effects that non-ratelimited traceroute does also allow a 2:1 reflected DoS of the network as well, but these concerns are less than the problem with positional confidentiality (other DoS routes exist).

CVE-2025-43856	2025-07-11T17:15:36.877	2025-07-15T13:14:49.980	immich is a high performance self-hosted photo and video management solution. Prior to 1.132.0, immich is vulnerable to account hijacking through oauth2, because the state parameter is not being checked. The oauth2 state parameter is similar to a csrf token, so when the user starts the login flow this unpredictable token is generated and somehow saved in the browser session and passed to the identity provider, which will return the state parameter when redirecting the user back to immich. Before the user is logged in that parameter needs to be verified to make sure the login was actively initiated by the user in this browser session. On it's own, this wouldn't be too bad, but when immich uses the /user-settings page as a redirect_uri, it will automatically link the accounts if the user was already logged in. This means that if someone has an immich instance with a public oauth provider (like google), an attacker can - for example - embed a hidden iframe in a webpage or even just send the victim a forged oauth login url with a code that logs the victim into the attackers oauth account and redirects back to immich and links the accounts. After this, the attacker can log into the victims account using their own oauth credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.132.0.					
CVE-2025-45582	2025-07-11T17:15:37.183	2025-08-18T04:15:36.743	"GNU Tar through 1.35 allows file overwrite via directory traversal in crafted TAR archives, with a certain two-step process. First, the victim must extract an archive that contains a ../ symlink to a critical directory. Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file's name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of ""Member name contains '..'"" that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain ""x -> ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh"" and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes in which ""tar xf"" is run more than once (e.g., when installing a package can automatically install two dependencies that are set up as untrusted tarballs instead of official packages). NOTE: the official GNU Tar manual has an otherwise-empty directory for each ""tar xf"" in its Security Rules of Thumb; however, third-party advice leads users to run ""tar xf"" more than once into the same directory."	4.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L

By hosting a crafted web page with JavaScript, the attacker can restore and invoke the window.print() function, launching a SYSTEM-privileged print dialog. From this dialog, the attacker can exploit standard Windows functionality - such as the Print to PDF or Add Printer wizard - to spawn a command prompt with SYSTEM privileges. Successful exploitation allows a local attacker (with access to a locked workstation) to gain SYSTEM-level privileges, granting full control over the affected device.	7.6	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2025-53835	2025-07-14T23:15:25.090	2025-08-26T17:52:40.370	XWiki Rendering is a generic rendering system that converts textual input in a given syntax (wiki syntax, HTML, etc) into another syntax (XHTML, etc). Starting in version 5.4.5 and prior to version 14.10, the XHTML syntax depended on the `xdom+xml/current` syntax which allows the creation of raw blocks that permit the insertion of arbitrary HTML content including JavaScript. This allows XSS attacks for users who can edit a document like their user profile (enabled by default). This has been fixed in version 14.10 by removing the dependency on the `xdom+xml/current` syntax from the XHTML syntax. Note that the `xdom+xml` syntax is still vulnerable to this attack. As it's main purpose is testing and its use is quite difficult, this syntax shouldn't be installed or used on a regular wiki.

Bad actors could execute the manual trigger Flows without authentication, or access rights to the said collection(s) or item(s). Users with manual trigger Flows configured are impacted as these endpoints do not currently validate if the user has read access to `directus_flows` or to the relevant collection/items.

Two related XML External Entity (XXE) injection possibilities impact all versions of DSpace prior to 7.6.4, 8.2, and 9.1. External entities are not disabled when parsing XML files during import of an archive (in Simple Archive Format), either from command-line (`./dspace import` command) or from the ""Batch Import (Zip)"" user interface feature. External entities are also not explicitly disabled when parsing XML responses from some upstream services (ArXiv, Crossref, OpenAIRE, Creative Commons) used in import from external sources via the user interface or REST API. An XXE injection in these files may result in a connection being made to an attacker's site or a local path readable by the Tomcat user, with content potentially being injected into a metadata field. In the latter case, this may result in sensitive content disclosure, including retrieving arbitrary files or configurations from the server where DSpace is running. The Simple Archive Format (SAF) importer / Batch Import (Zip) is only usable by site administrators (from user interface / REST API) or system administrators (from command-line). Therefore, to exploit this vulnerability, the malicious payload would have to be provided by an attacker and trusted by an administrator, who would trigger the import. The fix is included in DSpace 7.6.4, 8.2, and 9.1. Please upgrade to one of these versions. For those who cannot upgrade immediately, it is possible to manually patch the DSpace backend. One may also apply some best practices, though the protection provided is not as complete as upgrading.

CVE-2025-6993	2025-07-16T10:15:29.297	2025-08-02T01:29:41.363	The Ultimate WP Mail plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to improper authorization within the get_email_log_details() AJAX handler in versions 1.0.17 to 1.3.6. The handler reads the client-supplied post_id and retrieves the corresponding email log post content (including the password-reset link), relying only on the ‘edit_posts’ capability without restricting to administrators or validating ownership. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to harvest an admin’s reset link and elevate their privileges to administrator.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

A vulnerability exists in the EncryptionUtil class because symmetric encryption is implemented in a deterministic and non-randomized fashion. The method Encrypt(byte[] clearData) derives both the encryption key and the IV from a fixed, hardcoded input by using a static salt value. As a result, identical plaintext inputs always produce identical ciphertext outputs. This is true for both FIPS and non-FIPS generated passwords. In other words, there is a cryptographic implementation flaw in the password encryption mechanism. Although there are multiple encryption methods grouped under FIPS and non-FIPS classifications, the logic consistently results in predictable and reversible encrypted outputs due to the lack of per-operation randomness and encryption authentication.	7.4	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

CVE-2025-54064	2025-07-17T15:15:27.733	2025-07-17T21:15:50.197	Rucio is a software framework that provides functionality to organize, manage, and access large volumes of scientific data using customizable policies. The common Rucio helm-charts for the `rucio-server`, `rucio-ui`, and `rucio-webui` define the log format for the apache access log of these components. The `X-Rucio-Auth-Token`, which is part of each request header sent to Rucio, is part of this log format. Thus, each access log line potentially exposes the credentials (Internal Rucio token, or JWT in case of OIDC authentication) of the user. Due to the length of the token (Especially for a JWT) the tokens are often truncated, and thus not usable as credential; nevertheless, the (partial) credential should not be part of the logfile. The impact of this issue is amplified if the access logs are made available to a larger group of people than the instance administrators themselves. An updated release has been supplied for the `rucio-server`, `rucio-ui` and `rucio-webui` helm-chart. The change was also retrofitted for the currently supported Rucio LTS releases. The patched versions are rucio-server 37.0.2, 35.0.1, and 32.0.1; rucio-ui 37.0.4, 35.0.1, and 32.0.2; and rucio-webui 37.0.2, 35.1.1, and 32.0.1. As a workaround, one may update the `logFormat` variable and remove the `X-Rucio-Auth-Token`.

CVE-2025-54070	2025-07-17T19:15:25.623	2025-07-17T21:15:50.197	OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. Starting in version 5.2.0 and prior to version 5.4.0, the `lastIndexOf(bytes,byte,uint256)` function of the `Bytes.sol` library may access uninitialized memory when the following two conditions hold: 1) the provided buffer length is empty (i.e. `buffer.length == 0`) and position is not `2**256 - 1` (i.e. `pos != type(uint256).max`). The `pos` argument could be used to access arbitrary data outside of the buffer bounds. This could lead to the operation running out of gas, or returning an invalid index (outside of the empty buffer). Processing this invalid result for accessing the `buffer` would cause a revert under normal conditions. When triggered, the function reads memory at offset `buffer + 0x20 + pos`. If memory at that location (outside the `buffer`) matches the search pattern, the function would return an out of bound index instead of the expected `type(uint256).max`. This creates unexpected behavior where callers receive a valid-looking index pointing outside buffer bounds. Subsequent memory accesses that don't check bounds and use the returned index must carefully review the potential impact depending on their setup. Code relying on this function returning `type(uint256).max` for empty buffers or using the returned index without bounds checking could exhibit undefined behavior. Users should upgrade to version 5.4.0 to receive a patch.

CVE-2025-38349	2025-07-18T08:15:27.543	2025-08-19T06:15:32.513	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

eventpoll: don't decrement ep refcount while still holding the ep mutex

Jann Horn points out that epoll is decrementing the ep refcount and then
doing a

    mutex_unlock(&ep->mtx);

afterwards. That's very wrong, because it can lead to a use-after-free.

That pattern is actually fine for the very last reference, because the
code in question will delay the actual call to ""ep_free(ep)"" until after
it has unlocked the mutex.

But it's wrong for the much subtler ""next to last"" case when somebody
*else* may also be dropping their reference and free the ep while we're
still using the mutex.

Note that this is true even if that other user is also using the same ep
mutex: mutexes, unlike spinlocks, can not be used for object ownership,
even if they guarantee mutual exclusion.

A mutex ""unlock"" operation is not atomic, and as one user is still
accessing the mutex as part of unlocking it, another user can come in
and get the now released mutex and free the data structure while the
first user is still cleaning up.

See our mutex documentation in Documentation/locking/mutex-design.rst,
in particular the section [1] about semantics:

	""mutex_unlock() may access the mutex structure even after it has
	 internally released the lock already - so it's not safe for
	 another context to acquire the mutex and assume that the
	 mutex_unlock() context is not using the structure anymore""

So if we drop our ep ref before the mutex unlock, but we weren't the
last one, we may then unlock the mutex, another user comes in, drops
_their_ reference and releases the 'ep' as it now has no users - all
while the mutex_unlock() is still accessing it.

Fix this by simply moving the ep refcount dropping to outside the mutex:
the refcount itself is atomic, and doesn't need mutex protection (that's
the whole _point_ of refcounts: unlike mutexes, they are inherently
about object lifetimes)."

CVE-2025-53888	2025-07-18T16:15:29.057	2025-09-11T19:39:31.277	RIOT-OS, an operating system that supports Internet of Things devices, has an ineffective size check implemented with `assert()` can lead to buffer overflow in versions up to and including 2025.04. Assertions are usually compiled out in production builds. If assertions are the only defense against untrusted inputs, the software may be exposed to attacks that utilize the lack of proper input checks. In the `l2filter_add()` function shown below, `addr_len` is checked using an assertion and is subsequently used as an argument in a `memcpy()` call. When assertions are disabled, there would be no size check for `addr_len`. As a consequence, if an attacker were to provide an `addr_len` value larger than `CONFIG_L2FILTER_ADDR_MAXLEN`, they can trigger a buffer overflow and write past the `list[i].addr` buffer. If the unchecked input is attacker-controlled, the impact of the buffer overflow can range from a denial of service to arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2025-54073	2025-07-18T16:15:30.350	2025-07-22T19:15:25.863	mcp-package-docs is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides LLMs with efficient access to package documentation across multiple programming languages and language server protocol (LSP) capabilities. A command injection vulnerability exists in the `mcp-package-docs` MCP Server prior to the fix in commit cb4ad49615275379fd6f2f1cf1ec4731eec56eb9. The vulnerability is caused by the unsanitized use of input parameters within a call to `child_process.exec`, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the server process's privileges. The server constructs and executes shell commands using unvalidated user input directly within command-line strings. This introduces the possibility of shell metacharacter injection (`|`, `>`, `&&`, etc.). Commit cb4ad49615275379fd6f2f1cf1ec4731eec56eb9 in version 0.1.27 contains a fix for the issue, but upgrading to 0.1.28 is recommended.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2025-53901	2025-07-18T18:15:24.713	2025-09-04T17:12:30.060	Wasmtime is a runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to versions 24.0.4, 33.0.2, and 34.0.2, a bug in Wasmtime's implementation of the WASIp1 set of import functions can lead to a WebAssembly guest inducing a panic in the host (embedder). The specific bug is triggered by calling `path_open` after calling `fd_renumber` with either two equal argument values or a second argument being equal to a previously-closed file descriptor number value. The corrupt state introduced in `fd_renumber` will lead to the subsequent opening of a file descriptor to panic. This panic cannot introduce memory unsafety or allow WebAssembly to break outside of its sandbox, however. There is no possible heap corruption or memory unsafety from this panic. This bug is in the implementation of Wasmtime's `wasmtime-wasi` crate which provides an implementation of WASIp1. The bug requires a specially crafted call to `fd_renumber` in addition to the ability to open a subsequent file descriptor. Opening a second file descriptor is only possible when a preopened directory was provided to the guest, and this is common amongst embeddings. A panic in the host is considered a denial-of-service vector for WebAssembly embedders and is thus a security issue in Wasmtime. This bug does not affect WASIp2 and embedders using components. In accordance with Wasmtime's release process, patch releases are available as 24.0.4, 33.0.2, and 34.0.2. Users of other release of Wasmtime are recommended to move to a supported release of Wasmtime. Embedders who are using components or are not providing guest access to create more file descriptors (e.g. via a preopened filesystem directory) are not affected by this issue. Otherwise, there is no workaround at this time, and affected embeddings are recommended to update to a patched version which will not cause a panic in the host.	3.5	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

CVE-2025-7394	2025-07-18T23:15:23.470	2025-07-22T13:06:07.260	In the OpenSSL compatibility layer implementation, the function RAND_poll() was not behaving as expected and leading to the potential for predictable values returned from RAND_bytes() after fork() is called. This can lead to weak or predictable random numbers generated in applications that are both using RAND_bytes() and doing fork() operations. This only affects applications explicitly calling RAND_bytes() after fork() and does not affect any internal TLS operations. Although RAND_bytes() documentation in OpenSSL calls out not being safe for use with fork() without first calling RAND_poll(), an additional code change was also made in wolfSSL to make RAND_bytes() behave similar to OpenSSL after a fork() call without calling RAND_poll(). Now the Hash-DRBG used gets reseeded after detecting running in a new process. If making use of RAND_bytes() and calling fork() we recommend updating to the latest version of wolfSSL.

CVE-2025-38350	2025-07-19T07:15:22.043	2025-07-22T13:06:07.260	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: Always pass notifications when child class becomes empty

Certain classful qdiscs may invoke their classes' dequeue handler on an
enqueue operation. This may unexpectedly empty the child qdisc and thus
make an in-flight class passive via qlen_notify(). Most qdiscs do not
expect such behaviour at this point in time and may re-activate the
class eventually anyways which will lead to a use-after-free.

The referenced fix commit attempted to fix this behavior for the HFSC
case by moving the backlog accounting around, though this turned out to
be incomplete since the parent's parent may run into the issue too.
The following reproducer demonstrates this use-after-free:

    tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: drr
    tc filter add dev lo parent 1: basic classid 1:1
    tc class add dev lo parent 1: classid 1:1 drr
    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:1 handle 2: hfsc def 1
    tc class add dev lo parent 2: classid 2:1 hfsc rt m1 8 d 1 m2 0
    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 2:1 handle 3: netem
    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 3:1 handle 4: blackhole

    echo 1 | socat -u STDIN UDP4-DATAGRAM:127.0.0.1:8888
    tc class delete dev lo classid 1:1
    echo 1 | socat -u STDIN UDP4-DATAGRAM:127.0.0.1:8888

Since backlog accounting issues leading to a use-after-frees on stale
class pointers is a recurring pattern at this point, this patch takes
a different approach. Instead of trying to fix the accounting, the patch
ensures that qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog always calls qlen_notify when
the child qdisc is empty. This solves the problem because deletion of
qdiscs always involves a call to qdisc_reset() and / or
qdisc_purge_queue() which ultimately resets its qlen to 0 thus causing
the following qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() to report to the parent. Note
that this may call qlen_notify on passive classes multiple times. This
is not a problem after the recent patch series that made all the
classful qdiscs qlen_notify() handlers idempotent."

Hyper-V documents that invalid GVAs (those that are beyond a partition's
GVA space) are to be ignored.  While not completely clear whether this
ruling also applies to non-canonical GVAs, it is likely fine to make that
assumption, and manual testing on Azure confirms ""real"" Hyper-V interprets
the specification in the same way.

Skip non-canonical GVAs when processing the list of address to avoid
tripping the INVVPID failure.  Alternatively, KVM could filter out ""bad""
GVAs before inserting into the FIFO, but practically speaking the only
downside of pushing validation to the final processing is that doing so
is suboptimal for the guest, and no well-behaved guest will request TLB
flushes for non-canonical addresses."

The function mbedtls_x509_string_to_names() takes a head argument that is documented as an output argument. The documentation does not suggest that the function will free that pointer; however, the function does call mbedtls_asn1_free_named_data_list() on that argument, which performs a deep free(). As a result, application code that uses this function (relying only on documented behavior) is likely to still hold pointers to the memory blocks that were freed, resulting in a high risk of use-after-free or double-free. In particular, the two sample programs x509/cert_write and x509/cert_req are affected (use-after-free if the san string contains more than one DN).	8.9	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H

CVE-2025-54082	2025-07-21T17:15:37.357	2025-07-22T13:05:40.573	marshmallow-packages/nova-tiptap is a rich text editor for Laravel Nova based on tiptap. Prior to 5.7.0, a vulnerability was discovered in the marshmallow-packages/nova-tiptap Laravel Nova package that allows unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files to any Laravel disk configured in the application. The vulnerability is due to missing authentication middleware (Nova and Nova.Auth) on the /nova-tiptap/api/file upload endpoint, the lack of validation on uploaded files (no MIME/type or extension restrictions), and the ability for an attacker to choose the disk parameter dynamically. This means an attacker can craft a custom form and send a POST request to /nova-tiptap/api/file, supplying a valid CSRF token, and upload executable or malicious files (e.g., .php, binaries) to public disks such as local, public, or s3. If a publicly accessible storage path is used (e.g. S3 with public access, or Laravel’s public disk), the attacker may gain the ability to execute or distribute arbitrary files — amounting to a potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) vector in some environments. This vulnerability was fixed in 5.7.0.

posix-cpu-timers: fix race between handle_posix_cpu_timers() and posix_cpu_timer_del()

If an exiting non-autoreaping task has already passed exit_notify() and
calls handle_posix_cpu_timers() from IRQ, it can be reaped by its parent
or debugger right after unlock_task_sighand().

If a concurrent posix_cpu_timer_del() runs at that moment, it won't be
able to detect timer->it.cpu.firing != 0: cpu_timer_task_rcu() and/or
lock_task_sighand() will fail.

Add the tsk->exit_state check into run_posix_cpu_timers() to fix this.

This fix is not needed if CONFIG_POSIX_CPU_TIMERS_TASK_WORK=y, because
exit_task_work() is called before exit_notify(). But the check still
makes sense, task_work_add(&tsk->posix_cputimers_work.work) will fail

In versions 2025.06.25 and below, when the --exec option is used on Windows with the default placeholder (or {}), insufficient sanitization is applied to the expanded filepath, allowing for remote code execution. This is a bypass of the mitigation for CVE-2024-22423 where the default placeholder and {} were not covered by the new escaping rules. Windows users who are unable to upgrade should avoid using --exec altogether. Instead, the --write-info-json or --dump-json options could be used, with an external script or command line consuming the JSON output.

CVE-2025-54137	2025-07-22T22:15:38.097	2025-08-22T15:20:26.940	HAX CMS NodeJS allows users to manage their microsite universe with a NodeJS backend. Versions 11.0.9 and below were distributed with hardcoded default credentials for the user and superuser accounts. Additionally, the application has default private keys for JWTs. Users aren't prompted to change credentials or secrets during installation, and there is no way to change them through the UI. An unauthenticated attacker can read the default user credentials and JWT private keys from the public haxtheweb GitHub repositories. These credentials and keys can be used to access unconfigured self-hosted instances of the application, modify sites, and perform further attacks.

LibreNMS versions 25.6.0 and below contain an architectural vulnerability in the ajax_form.php endpoint that permits Remote File Inclusion based on user-controlled POST input. The application directly uses the type parameter to dynamically include .inc.php files from the trusted path includes/html/forms/, without validation or allowlisting. This pattern introduces a latent Remote Code Execution (RCE) vector if an attacker can stage a file in this include path — for example, via symlink, development misconfiguration, or chained vulnerabilities.

The security responsibility for this usage pattern lies with the calling application, which must ensure the sanitization and validation of any untrusted arguments before passing them to the executed commands. Therefore, the potential for command injection is not a flaw within Bun itself; rather, it is an argument injection that is contingent on its implementation by the consuming application.

CVE-2025-47281	2025-07-23T21:15:26.397	2025-08-05T15:51:19.533	Kyverno is a policy engine designed for cloud native platform engineering teams. In versions 1.14.1 and below, a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists due to improper handling of JMESPath variable substitutions. Attackers with permissions to create or update Kyverno policies can craft expressions using the {{@}} variable combined with a pipe and an invalid JMESPath function (e.g., {{@ | non_existent_function }}). This leads to a nil value being substituted into the policy structure. Subsequent processing by internal functions, specifically getValueAsStringMap, which expect string values, results in a panic due to a type assertion failure (interface {} is nil, not string). This crashes Kyverno worker threads in the admission controller and causes continuous crashes of the reports controller pod. This is fixed in version 1.14.2.	7.7	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H

There is a small chance that the GPU is already hot during boot. In that

apply devfreq cooling, as seen in the following crash:

At this point we haven't initialized the GMU at all yet, so we cannot read
the GMU registers inside a6xx_gpu_busy(). A similar issue was fixed before
in commit 6694482a70e9 (""drm/msm: Avoid unclocked GMU register access in
6xx gpu_busy""): msm_devfreq_init() does call devfreq_suspend_device(), but
unlike msm_devfreq_suspend(), it doesn't set the df->suspended flag
accordingly. This means the df->suspended flag does not match the actual
devfreq state after initialization and msm_devfreq_get_dev_status() will
end up accessing GMU registers, causing the crash.

Fix this by setting df->suspended correctly during initialization.

drm/xe: Process deferred GGTT node removals on device unwind

While we are indirectly draining our dedicated workqueue ggtt->wq
that we use to complete asynchronous removal of some GGTT nodes,
this happends as part of the managed-drm unwinding (ggtt_fini_early),
which could be later then manage-device unwinding, where we could
already unmap our MMIO/GMS mapping (mmio_fini).

During driver probe we might be briefly using CT safe mode, which
is based on a delayed work, but usually we are able to stop this

quite early then during unwind we might try to destroy the workqueue

itself which triggers a WARN.

This can happen due to a race with the async reclaim worker like this:

1) The async metadata reclaim worker enters shrink_delalloc(), which calls
   btrfs_start_delalloc_roots() with an nr_pages argument that has a value
   less than LONG_MAX, and that in turn enters start_delalloc_inodes(),
   which sets the local variable 'full_flush' to false because
   wbc->nr_to_write is less than LONG_MAX;

2) There it finds inode X in a root's delalloc list, grabs a reference for
   inode X (with igrab()), and triggers writeback for it with
   filemap_fdatawrite_wbc(), which creates an ordered extent for inode X;

3) The unmount sequence starts from another task, we enter close_ctree()
   and we flush the workqueue fs_info->endio_write_workers, which waits
   for the ordered extent for inode X to complete and when dropping the
   last reference of the ordered extent, with btrfs_put_ordered_extent(),
   when we call btrfs_add_delayed_iput() we don't add the inode to the
   list of delayed iputs because it has a refcount of 2, so we decrement
   it to 1 and return;

4) Shortly after at close_ctree() we call btrfs_run_delayed_iputs() which
   runs all delayed iputs, and then we set BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DELAYED_IPUT
   in the fs_info state;

5) The async reclaim worker, after calling filemap_fdatawrite_wbc(), now
   calls btrfs_add_delayed_iput() for inode X and there we trigger an
   assertion failure since the fs_info state has the flag
   BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DELAYED_IPUT set.

Fix this by setting BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DELAYED_IPUT only after we wait for
the async reclaim workers to finish, after we call cancel_work_sync() for
them at close_ctree(), and by running delayed iputs after wait for the
reclaim workers to finish and before setting the bit.

This race was recently introduced by commit 19e60b2a95f5 (""btrfs: add
extra warning if delayed iput is added when it's not allowed""). Without
the new validation at btrfs_add_delayed_iput(),

btrfs: fix a race between renames and directory logging

We have a race between a rename and directory inode logging that if it
happens and we crash/power fail before the rename completes, the next time
the filesystem is mounted, the log replay code will end up deleting the
file that was being renamed.

This is best explained following a step by step analysis of an interleaving
of steps that lead into this situation.

Consider the initial conditions:

1) We are at transaction N;

2) We have directories A and B created in a past transaction (< N);

3) We have inode X corresponding to a file that has 2 hardlinks, one in
   directory A and the other in directory B, so we'll name them as
   ""A/foo_link1"" and ""B/foo_link2"". Both hard links were persisted in a
   past transaction (< N);

4) We have inode Y corresponding to a file that as a single hard link and
   is located in directory A, we'll name it as ""A/bar"". This file was also
   persisted in a past transaction (< N).

The steps leading to a file loss are the following and for all of them we
are under transaction N:

 1) Link ""A/foo_link1"" is removed, so inode's X last_unlink_trans field
    is updated to N, through btrfs_unlink() -> btrfs_record_unlink_dir();

 2) Task A starts a rename for inode Y, with the goal of renaming from
    ""A/bar"" to ""A/baz"", so we enter btrfs_rename();

 3) Task A inserts the new BTRFS_INODE_REF_KEY for inode Y by calling
    btrfs_insert_inode_ref();

 4) Because the rename happens in the same directory, we don't set the
    last_unlink_trans field of directoty A's inode to the current
    transaction id, that is, we don't cal btrfs_record_unlink_dir();

 5) Task A then removes the entries from directory A (BTRFS_DIR_ITEM_KEY
    and BTRFS_DIR_INDEX_KEY items) when calling __btrfs_unlink_inode()
    (actually the dir index item is added as a delayed item, but the
    effect is the same);

 6) Now before task A adds the new entry ""A/baz"" to directory A by
    calling btrfs_add_link(), another task, task B is logging inode X;

 7) Task B starts a fsync of inode X and after logging inode X, at
    btrfs_log_inode_parent() it calls btrfs_log_all_parents(), since
    inode X has a last_unlink_trans value of N, set at in step 1;

 8) At btrfs_log_all_parents() we search for all parent directories of
    inode X using the commit root, so we find directories A and B and log
    them. Bu when logging direct A, we don't have a dir index item for
    inode Y anymore, neither the old name ""A/bar"" nor for the new name
    ""A/baz"" since the rename has deleted the old name but has not yet
    inserted the new name - task A hasn't called yet btrfs_add_link() to
    do that.

    Note that logging directory A doesn't fallback to a transaction
    commit because its last_unlink_trans has a lower value than the
    current transaction's id (see step 4);

 9) Task B finishes logging directories A and B and gets back to
    btrfs_sync_file() where it calls btrfs_sync_log() to persist the log
    tree;

10) Task B successfully persisted the log tree, btrfs_sync_log() completed
    with success, and a power failure happened.

    We have a log tree without any directory entry for inode Y, so the
    log replay code deletes the entry for inode Y, name ""A/bar"", from the
    subvolume tree since it doesn't exist in the log tree and the log
    tree is authorative for its index (we logged a BTRFS_DIR_LOG_INDEX_KEY
    item that covers the index range for the dentry that corresponds to
    ""A/bar"").

    Since there's no other hard link for inode Y and the log replay code
    deletes the name ""A/bar"", the file is lost.

The issue wouldn't happen if task B synced the log only after task A
called btrfs_log_new_name(), which would update the log with the new name
for inode Y (""A/bar"").

Fix this by pinning the log root during renames before removing the old
directory entry, and unpinning af

btrfs: fix failure to rebuild free space tree using multiple transactions

If we are rebuilding a free space tree, while modifying the free space
tree we may need to allocate a new metadata block group.
If we end up using multiple transactions for the rebuild, when we call
btrfs_end_transaction() we enter btrfs_create_pending_block_groups()
which calls add_block_group_free_space() to add items to the free space
tree for the block group.

Then later during the free space tree rebuild, at
btrfs_rebuild_free_space_tree(), we may find such new block groups
and call populate_free_space_tree() for them, which fails with -EEXIST
because there are already items in the free space tree. Then we abort the
transaction with -EEXIST at btrfs_rebuild_free_space_tree().
Notice that we say ""may find"" the new block groups because a new block
group may be inserted in the block groups rbtree, which is being iterated
by the rebuild process, before or after the current node where the rebuild
process is currently at.

CVE-2025-38373	2025-07-25T13:15:26.283	2025-07-25T15:29:19.837	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

IB/mlx5: Fix potential deadlock in MR deregistration

The issue arises when kzalloc() is invoked while holding umem_mutex or
any other lock acquired under umem_mutex. This is problematic because
kzalloc() can trigger fs_reclaim_aqcuire(), which may, in turn, invoke
mmu_notifier_invalidate_range_start(). This function can lead to
mlx5_ib_invalidate_range(), which attempts to acquire umem_mutex again,
resulting in a deadlock.

The problematic flow:
             CPU0                      |              CPU1
---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------
mlx5_ib_dereg_mr()                     |
 → revoke_mr()                         |
   → mutex_lock(&umem_odp->umem_mutex) |
                                       | mlx5_mkey_cache_init()
                                       |  → mutex_lock(&dev->cache.rb_lock)
                                       |  → mlx5r_cache_create_ent_locked()
                                       |    → kzalloc(GFP_KERNEL)
                                       |      → fs_reclaim()
                                       |        → mmu_notifier_invalidate_range_start()
                                       |          → mlx5_ib_invalidate_range()
                                       |            → mutex_lock(&umem_odp->umem_mutex)
   → cache_ent_find_and_store()        |
     → mutex_lock(&dev->cache.rb_lock) |

Additionally, when kzalloc() is called from within
cache_ent_find_and_store(), we encounter the same deadlock due to
re-acquisition of umem_mutex.

Solve by releasing umem_mutex in dereg_mr() after umr_revoke_mr()
and before acquiring rb_lock. This ensures that we don't hold
umem_mutex while performing memory allocations that could trigger
the reclaim path.

This change prevents the deadlock by ensuring proper lock ordering and
avoiding holding locks during memory allocation operations that could
trigger the reclaim path.

The following lockdep warning demonstrates the deadlock:

 python3/20557 is trying to acquire lock:

usb: chipidea: udc: disconnect/reconnect from host when do suspend/resume

Shawn and John reported a hang issue during system suspend as below:

 - USB gadget is enabled as Ethernet
 - There is data transfer over USB Ethernet (scp a big file between host
                                             and device)
 - Device is going in/out suspend (echo mem > /sys/power/state)

The root cause is the USB device controller is suspended but the USB bus
is still active which caused the USB host continues to transfer data with
device and the device continues to queue USB requests (in this case, a
delayed TCP ACK packet trigger the issue) after controller is suspended,
however the USB controller clock is already gated off. Then if udc driver
access registers after that point, the system will hang.

The correct way to avoid such issue is to disconnect device from host when
the USB bus is not at suspend state. Then the host will receive disconnect
event and stop data transfer in time. To continue make USB gadget device
work after system resume, this will reconnect device automatically.

To make usb wakeup work if USB bus is already at suspend state, this will
keep connection for it only when USB device controller has enabled wakeup
capability."

rose: fix dangling neighbour pointers in rose_rt_device_down()

There are two bugs in rose_rt_device_down() that can cause
use-after-free:

1. The loop bound `t->count` is modified within the loop, which can
   cause the loop to terminate early and miss some entries.

2. When removing an entry from the neighbour array, the subsequent entries
   are moved up to fill the gap, but the loop index `i` is still
   incremented, causing the next entry to be skipped.

For example, if a node has three neighbours (A, A, B) with count=3 and A
is being removed, the second A is not checked.

    i=0: (A, A, B) -> (A, B) with count=2
          ^ checked
    i=1: (A, B)    -> (A, B) with count=2
             ^ checked (B, not A!)
    i=2: (doesn't occur because i < count is false)

This leaves the second A in the array with count=2, but the rose_neigh
structure has been freed. Code that accesses these entries assumes that
the first `count` entries are valid pointers, causing a use-after-free
when it accesses the dangling pointer.

Fix both issues by iterating over the array in reverse order with a fixed
loop bound. This ensures that all entries are examined and that the removal
of an entry doesn't affect subsequent iterations."

HID: appletb-kbd: fix slab use-after-free bug in appletb_kbd_probe

In probe appletb_kbd_probe() a ""struct appletb_kbd *kbd"" is allocated

Later on if backlight_device_get_by_name() finds a backlight device

The root cause of the issue is that the timer is not disarmed
on failure paths leading to it remaining active and accessing
freed memory. To fix this call timer_delete_sync() to deactivate
the timer.

Another small issue is that timer_delete_sync is called
unconditionally in appletb_kbd_remove(), fix this by checking
for a valid kbd->backlight_dev before calling timer_delete_sync."

smb: client: fix warning when reconnecting channel

When reconnecting a channel in smb2_reconnect_server(), a dummy tcon

Fix the following warning by ensuring that we're queueing the delayed
worker from correct tcon.

disconnect:

  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 11 at net/core/dev.c:7417 __netif_napi_del_locked+0x2b4/0x350

This happens because netif_napi_del() is called in the disconnect path while
NAPI is still enabled. However, it is not necessary to call netif_napi_del()
explicitly, since unregister_netdev() will handle NAPI teardown automatically
and safely. Removing the redundant call avoids triggering the warning.

To address this, replace the mutex with an rwlock to protect the notifier
hashtable accesses. This ensures that read-side locking does not sleep and
multiple readers can acquire the lock concurrently, avoiding unnecessary
contention and potential deadlocks. Writer access remains exclusive,
preserving correctness.

This change resolves warnings from lockdep about potential sleep in
atomic context."

Closer analysis of CI results history has revealed a dependency of the
error on a few IGT tests, namely:
- igt@api_intel_allocator@fork-simple-stress-signal,
- igt@api_intel_allocator@two-level-inception-interruptible,
- igt@gem_linear_blits@interruptible,
- igt@prime_mmap_coherency@ioctl-errors,
which invisibly trigger the issue, then exhibited with first driver unbind
attempt.

All of the above tests perform actions which are actively interrupted with
signals.  Further debugging has allowed to narrow that scope down to
DRM_IOCTL_I915_GEM_EXECBUFFER2, and ring_context_alloc(), specific to ring
submission, in particular.

If successful then that function, or its execlists or GuC submission
equivalent, is supposed to be called only once per GEM context engine,
followed by raise of a flag that prevents the function from being called
again.  The function is expected to unwind its internal errors itself, so
it may be safely called once more after it returns an error.

In case of ring submission, the function first gets a reference to the
engine's legacy timeline and then allocates a VMA.  If the VMA allocation
fails, e.g. when i915_vma_instance() called from inside is interrupted
with a signal, then ring_context_alloc() fails, leaving the timeline held
referenced.  On next I915_GEM_EXECBUFFER2 IOCTL, another reference to the
timeline is got, and only that last one is put on successful completion.
As a consequence, the legacy timeline, with its underlying engine status
page's VMA object, is still held and not released on driver unbind.

Get the legacy timeline only after successful allocation of the context
engine's VMA.

v2: Add a note on other submission methods (Krzysztof Karas):
    Both execlists and GuC submission use lrc_alloc() which seems free
    from a similar issue.

HID: appletb-kbd: fix memory corruption of input_handler_list

In appletb_kbd_probe an input handler is initialised and then registered
with input core through input_register_handler(). When this happens input
core will add the input handler (specifically its node) to the global
input_handler_list. The input_handler_list is central to the functionality
of input core and is traversed in various places in input core. An example
of this is when a new input device is plugged in and gets registered with
input core.

The input_handler in probe is allocated as device managed memory. If a
probe failure occurs after input_register_handler() the input_handler
memory is freed, yet it will remain in the input_handler_list. This
effectively means the input_handler_list contains a dangling pointer
to data belonging to a freed input handler.

This causes an issue when any other input device is plugged in - in my
case I had an old PixArt HP USB optical mouse and I decided to
plug it in after a failure occurred after input_register_handler().
This lead to the registration of this input device via
input_register_device which involves traversing over every handler
in the corrupted input_handler_list and calling input_attach_handler(),
giving each handler a chance to bind to newly registered device.

The core of this bug is a UAF which causes memory corruption of
input_handler_list and to fix it we must ensure the input handler is
unregistered from input core, this is done through
input_unregister_handler().

regulator: gpio: Fix the out-of-bounds access to drvdata::gpiods

drvdata::gpiods is supposed to hold an array of 'gpio_desc' pointers. But
the memory is allocated for only one pointer. This will lead to
out-of-bounds access later in the code if 'config::ngpios' is > 1. So
fix the code to allocate enough memory to hold 'config::ngpios' of GPIO
descriptors.

While at it, also move the check for memory allocation failure to be below
the allocation to make it more readable."

fs: export anon_inode_make_secure_inode() and fix secretmem LSM bypass

Export anon_inode_make_secure_inode() to allow KVM guest_memfd to create
anonymous inodes with proper security context. This replaces the current
pattern of calling alloc_anon_inode() followed by
inode_init_security_anon() for creating security context manually.

This change also fixes a security regression in secretmem where the
S_PRIVATE flag was not cleared after alloc_anon_inode(), causing
LSM/SELinux checks to be bypassed for secretmem file descriptors.

As guest_memfd currently resides in the KVM module, we need to export this
symbol for use outside the core kernel. In the future, guest_memfd might be
moved to core-mm, at which point the symbols no longer would have to be
exported. When/if that happens is still unclear."

spi: spi-qpic-snand: reallocate BAM transactions

Using the mtd_nandbiterrs module for testing the driver occasionally
results in weird things like below.

1. swiotlb mapping fails with the following message:

  [   85.926216] qcom_snand 79b0000.spi: swiotlb buffer is full (sz: 4294967294 bytes), total 512 (slots), used 0 (slots)

  [   87.999352] mtd_nandbiterrs: error: write_oob failed (-110)

  Rebooting the board after this causes a panic due to a NULL pointer
  dereference.

2. If the swiotlb mapping does not fail, rebooting the board may result
   in a different panic due to a bad spinlock magic:

  [  256.104459] BUG: spinlock bad magic on CPU#3, procd/2241
  [  256.104488] Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffffffff0000049b
  ...

Investigating the issue revealed that these symptoms are results of
memory corruption which is caused by out of bounds access within the
driver.

The driver uses a dynamically allocated structure for BAM transactions,
which structure must have enough space for all possible variations of
different flash operations initiated by the driver. The required space
heavily depends on the actual number of 'codewords' which is calculated
from the pagesize of the actual NAND chip.

Although the qcom_nandc_alloc() function allocates memory for the BAM
transactions during probe, but since the actual number of 'codewords'
is not yet know the allocation is done for one 'codeword' only.

Because of this, whenever the driver does a flash operation, and the
number of the required transactions exceeds the size of the allocated
arrays the driver accesses memory out of the allocated range.

To avoid this, change the code to free the initially allocated BAM
transactions memory, and allocate a new one once the actual number of
'codewords' required for a given NAND chip is known."

CVE-2025-43712	2025-07-25T13:15:29.927	2025-08-04T12:15:26.787	JHipster before v.8.9.0 allows privilege escalation via a modified authorities parameter. Upon registering in the JHipster portal and logging in as a standard user, the authorities parameter in the response from the api/account endpoint contains the value ROLE_USER. By manipulating the authorities parameter and changing its value to ROLE_ADMIN, the privilege is successfully escalated to an Admin level. This allowed the access to all admin-related functionalities in the application. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because there is no privilege escalation in the context of the JHipster backend (the report only demonstrates that, after using JHipster to generate an application, one can make a non-functional admin screen visible in the front end of that application).	2.9	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

riscv: cpu_ops_sbi: Use static array for boot_data

Since commit 6b9f29b81b15 (""riscv: Enable pcpu page first chunk
allocator""), if NUMA is enabled, the page percpu allocator may be used
on very sparse configurations, or when requested on boot with
percpu_alloc=page.

In that case, percpu data gets put in the vmalloc area. However,
sbi_hsm_hart_start() needs the physical address of a sbi_hart_boot_data,
and simply assumes that __pa() would work. This causes the just started
hart to immediately access an invalid address and hang.

Fortunately, struct sbi_hart_boot_data is not too large, so we can
simply allocate an array for boot_data statically, putting it in the
kernel image.

This fixes NUMA=y SMP boot on Sophgo SG2042.

To reproduce on QEMU: Set CONFIG_NUMA=y and CONFIG_DEBUG_VIRTUAL=y, then
run with:

  qemu-system-riscv64 -M virt -smp 2 -nographic \
    -kernel arch/riscv/boot/Image \
    -append ""percpu_alloc=page""

video: screen_info: Relocate framebuffers behind PCI bridges

Apply PCI host-bridge window offsets to screen_info framebuffers. Fixes
invalid access to I/O memory.

Resources behind a PCI host bridge can be relocated by a certain offset
in the kernel's CPU address range used for I/O. The framebuffer memory
range stored in screen_info refers to the CPU addresses as seen during
boot (where the offset is 0). During boot up, firmware may assign a
different memory offset to the PCI host bridge and thereby relocating
the framebuffer address of the PCI graphics device as seen by the kernel.
The information in screen_info must be updated as well.

The helper pcibios_bus_to_resource() performs the relocation of the
screen_info's framebuffer resource (given in PCI bus addresses). The
result matches the I/O-memory resource of the PCI graphics device (given
in CPU addresses). As before, we store away the information necessary to
later update the information in screen_info itself.

Commit 78aa89d1dfba (""firmware/sysfb: Update screen_info for relocated
EFI framebuffers"") added the code for updating screen_info. It is based
on similar functionality that pre-existed in efifb. Efifb uses a pointer
to the PCI resource, while the newer code does a memcpy of the region.
Hence efifb sees any updates to the PCI resource and avoids the issue.

v3:
- Only use struct pci_bus_region for PCI bus addresses (Bjorn)
- Clarify address semantics in commit messages and comments (Bjorn)
v2:
- Fixed tags (Takashi, Ivan)
- Updated information on efifb"

riscv: fix runtime constant support for nommu kernels

the `__runtime_fixup_32` function does not handle the case where `val` is
zero correctly (as might occur when patching a nommu kernel and referring
to a physical address below the 4GiB boundary whose upper 32 bits are all
zero) because nothing in the existing logic prevents the code from taking
the `else` branch of both nop-checks and emitting two `nop` instructions.

This leaves random garbage in the register that is supposed to receive the
upper 32 bits of the pointer instead of zero that when combined with the
value for the lower 32 bits yields an invalid pointer and causes a kernel
panic when that pointer is eventually accessed.

The author clearly considered the fact that if the `lui` is converted into
a `nop` that the second instruction needs to be adjusted to become an `li`
instead of an `addi`, hence introducing the `addi_insn_mask` variable, but
didn't follow that logic through fully to the case where the `else` branch
executes. To fix it just adjust the logic to ensure that the second `else`
branch is not taken if the first instruction will be patched to a `nop`."

Revert ""riscv: Define TASK_SIZE_MAX for __access_ok()""

This reverts commit ad5643cf2f69 (""riscv: Define TASK_SIZE_MAX for
__access_ok()"").

This commit changes TASK_SIZE_MAX to be LONG_MAX to optimize access_ok(),
because the previous TASK_SIZE_MAX (default to TASK_SIZE) requires some
computation.

The reasoning was that all user addresses are less than LONG_MAX, and all
kernel addresses are greater than LONG_MAX. Therefore access_ok() can
filter kernel addresses.

Addresses between TASK_SIZE and LONG_MAX are not valid user addresses, but
access_ok() let them pass. That was thought to be okay, because they are
not valid addresses at hardware level.

Unfortunately, one case is missed: get_user_pages_fast() happily accepts
addresses between TASK_SIZE and LONG_MAX. futex(), for instance, uses
get_user_pages_fast(). This causes the problem reported by Robert [1].

Therefore, revert this commit. TASK_SIZE_MAX is changed to the default:
TASK_SIZE.

This unfortunately reduces performance, because TASK_SIZE is more expensive
to compute compared to LONG_MAX. But correctness first, we can think about
optimization later, if required."

CVE-2013-10032	2025-07-25T16:15:24.550	2025-09-23T23:44:07.920	An authenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in GetSimpleCMS version 3.2.1. The application’s upload.php endpoint allows authenticated users to upload arbitrary files without proper validation of MIME types or extensions. By uploading a .pht file containing PHP code, an attacker can bypass blacklist-based restrictions and place executable code within the web root. A crafted request using a polyglot or disguised extension allows the attacker to execute the payload by accessing the file directly via the web server. This vulnerability exists due to the use of a blacklist for filtering file types instead of a whitelist.	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2014-125114	2025-07-25T16:15:25.693	2025-07-29T14:15:33.463	A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in i-Ftp version 2.20 due to improper handling of the Time attribute within Schedule.xml. By placing a specially crafted Schedule.xml file in the i-Ftp application directory, a remote attacker can trigger a buffer overflow during scheduled download parsing, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or a crash.					
CVE-2014-125115	2025-07-25T16:15:25.870	2025-07-29T14:14:55.157	An unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability exists in Pandora FMS version 5.0 SP2 and earlier. The mobile/index.php endpoint fails to properly sanitize user input in the loginhash_data parameter, allowing attackers to extract administrator credentials or active session tokens via crafted requests. This occurs because input is directly concatenated into an SQL query without adequate validation, enabling SQL injection. After authentication is bypassed, a second vulnerability in the File Manager component permits arbitrary PHP file uploads. The file upload functionality does not enforce MIME-type or file extension restrictions, allowing authenticated users to upload web shells into a publicly accessible directory and achieve remote code execution.					
CVE-2014-125116	2025-07-25T16:15:26.053	2025-07-29T14:15:34.137	A remote code execution vulnerability exists in HybridAuth versions 2.0.9 through 2.2.2 due to insecure use of the install.php installation script. The script remains accessible after deployment and fails to sanitize input before writing to the application’s config.php file. An unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary PHP code into config.php, which is later executed when the file is loaded. This allows attackers to achieve remote code execution on the server. Exploitation of this issue will overwrite the existing configuration, rendering the application non-functional.					
CVE-2014-125117	2025-07-25T16:15:26.213	2025-09-23T18:03:59.860	A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the my_cgi.cgi component of certain D-Link devices, including the DSP-W215 version 1.02, can be exploited via a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the /common/info.cgi endpoint. This flaw enables an unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution with system-level privileges.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2014-125118	2025-07-25T16:15:26.360	2025-07-29T14:14:55.157	A command injection vulnerability exists in the eScan Web Management Console version 5.5-2. The application fails to properly sanitize the 'pass' parameter when processing login requests to login.php, allowing an authenticated attacker with a valid username to inject arbitrary commands via a specially crafted password value. Successful exploitation results in remote code execution. Privilege escalation to root is possible by abusing the runasroot utility with mwconf-level privileges.					
CVE-2014-125119	2025-07-25T16:15:26.507	2025-07-29T14:14:55.157	A filename spoofing vulnerability exists in WinRAR when opening specially crafted ZIP archives. The issue arises due to inconsistencies between the Central Directory and Local File Header entries in ZIP files. When viewed in WinRAR, the file name from the Central Directory is displayed to the user, while the file from the Local File Header is extracted and executed. An attacker can leverage this flaw to spoof filenames and trick users into executing malicious payloads under the guise of harmless files, potentially leading to remote code execution.

net/mlx5e: Fix race between DIM disable and net_dim()

There's a race between disabling DIM and NAPI callbacks using the dim
pointer on the RQ or SQ.

If NAPI checks the DIM state bit and sees it still set, it assumes
`rq->dim` or `sq->dim` is valid. But if DIM gets disabled right after
that check, the pointer might already be set to NULL, leading to a NULL
pointer dereference in net_dim().

Fix this by calling `synchronize_net()` before freeing the DIM context.
This ensures all in-progress NAPI callbacks are finished before the
pointer is cleared.

mm/rmap: fix potential out-of-bounds page table access during batched unmap

As pointed out by David[1], the batched unmap logic in
try_to_unmap_one() may read past the end of a PTE table when a large
folio's PTE mappings are not fully contained within a single page
table.

While this scenario might be rare, an issue triggerable from userspace
must be fixed regardless of its likelihood.  This patch fixes the
out-of-bounds access by refactoring the logic into a new helper,
folio_unmap_pte_batch().

The new helper correctly calculates the safe batch size by capping the
scan at both the VMA and PMD boundaries.  To simplify the code, it also
supports partial batching (i.e., any number of pages from 1 up to the
calculated safe maximum), as there is no strong reason to special-case
for fully mapped folios."

mode-setting operations leads to a segmentation fault. Most easily
happens with driver that use shadow planes for vmap-ing the dma-buf
during a page flip. An example is shown below.

Commit 1a148af06000 (""drm/gem-shmem: Use dma_buf from GEM object

field more widely. The underlying issue with reference counting has
been present before.

wifi: mt76: mt7925: prevent NULL pointer dereference in mt7925_sta_set_decap_offload()

Add a NULL check for msta->vif before accessing its members to prevent
a kernel panic in AP mode deployment. This also fix the issue reported
in [1].

The crash occurs when this function is triggered before the station is
fully initialized. The call trace shows a page fault at
mt7925_sta_set_decap_offload() due to accessing resources when msta->vif
is NULL.

Fix this by adding an early return if msta->vif is NULL and also check
wcid.sta is ready. This ensures we only proceed with decap offload
configuration when the station's state is properly initialized.

vCPU creation runs _outside_ of kvm->lock to allow creating multiple vCPUs
in parallel, and so sev_info.es_active can get toggled from false=>true in
the destination VM after (or during) svm_vcpu_create(), resulting in an
SEV{-ES} VM effectively having a non-SEV{-ES} vCPU.

The issue manifests most visibly as a crash when trying to free a vCPU's
NULL VMSA page in an SEV-ES VM, but any number of things can go wrong.

net/sched: Abort __tc_modify_qdisc if parent class does not exist

Lion's patch [1] revealed an ancient bug in the qdisc API.
Whenever a user creates/modifies a qdisc specifying as a parent another
qdisc, the qdisc API will, during grafting, detect that the user is
not trying to attach to a class and reject. However grafting is
performed after qdisc_create (and thus the qdiscs' init callback) is
executed. In qdiscs that eventually call qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog
during init or change (such as fq, hhf, choke, etc), an issue
arises. For example, executing the following commands:

sudo tc qdisc add dev lo root handle a: htb default 2
sudo tc qdisc add dev lo parent a: handle beef fq

Qdiscs such as fq, hhf, choke, etc unconditionally invoke
qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() in their control path init() or change() which
then causes a failure to find the child class; however, that does not stop
the unconditional invocation of the assumed child qdisc's qlen_notify with
a null class. All these qdiscs make the assumption that class is non-null.

The solution is ensure that qdisc_leaf() which looks up the parent
class, and is invoked prior to qdisc_create(), should return failure on
not finding the class.
In this patch, we leverage qdisc_leaf to return ERR_PTRs whenever the
parentid doesn't correspond to a class, so that we can detect it
earlier on and abort before qdisc_create is called.

atm: clip: Fix infinite recursive call of clip_push().

syzbot reported the splat below. [0]

This happens if we call ioctl(ATMARP_MKIP) more than once.

During the first call, clip_mkip() sets clip_push() to vcc->push(),
and the second call copies it to clip_vcc->old_push().

Later, when the socket is close()d, vcc_destroy_socket() passes
NULL skb to clip_push(), which calls clip_vcc->old_push(),
triggering the infinite recursion.

Let's prevent the second ioctl(ATMARP_MKIP) by checking
vcc->user_back, which is allocated by the first call as clip_vcc.

Note also that we use lock_sock() to prevent racy calls.

tcp: Correct signedness in skb remaining space calculation

Syzkaller reported a bug [1] where sk->sk_forward_alloc can overflow.

When we send data, if an skb exists at the tail of the write queue, the
kernel will attempt to append the new data to that skb. However, the code
that checks for available space in the skb is flawed:
'''
copy = size_goal - skb->len
'''

The types of the variables involved are:
'''
copy: ssize_t (s64 on 64-bit systems)
size_goal: int
skb->len: unsigned int
'''

Due to C's type promotion rules, the signed size_goal is converted to an
unsigned int to match skb->len before the subtraction. The result is an
unsigned int.

When this unsigned int result is then assigned to the s64 copy variable,
it is zero-extended, preserving its non-negative value. Consequently, copy
is always >= 0.

Assume we are sending 2GB of data and size_goal has been adjusted to a
value smaller than skb->len. The subtraction will result in copy holding a
very large positive integer. In the subsequent logic, this large value is
used to update sk->sk_forward_alloc, which can easily cause it to overflow.

The syzkaller reproducer uses TCP_REPAIR to reliably create this
condition. However, this can also occur in real-world scenarios. The
tcp_bound_to_half_wnd() function can also reduce size_goal to a small
value. This would cause the subsequent tcp_wmem_schedule() to set
sk->sk_forward_alloc to a value close to INT_MAX. Further memory
allocation requests would then cause sk_forward_alloc to wrap around and
become negative.

tipc: Fix use-after-free in tipc_conn_close().

syzbot reported a null-ptr-deref in tipc_conn_close() during netns
dismantle. [0]

tipc_topsrv_stop() iterates tipc_net(net)->topsrv->conn_idr and calls
tipc_conn_close() for each tipc_conn.

The problem is that tipc_conn_close() is called after releasing the
IDR lock.

At the same time, there might be tipc_conn_recv_work() running and it
could call tipc_conn_close() for the same tipc_conn and release its
last ->kref.

Once we release the IDR lock in tipc_topsrv_stop(), there is no
guarantee that the tipc_conn is alive.

CVE-2025-38465	2025-07-25T16:15:32.527	2025-07-29T14:14:55.157	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netlink: Fix wraparounds of sk->sk_rmem_alloc.

Netlink has this pattern in some places

  if (atomic_read(&sk->sk_rmem_alloc) > sk->sk_rcvbuf)
  	atomic_add(skb->truesize, &sk->sk_rmem_alloc);

, which has the same problem fixed by commit 5a465a0da13e (""udp:
Fix multiple wraparounds of sk->sk_rmem_alloc."").

For example, if we set INT_MAX to SO_RCVBUFFORCE, the condition
is always false as the two operands are of int.

Then, a single socket can eat as many skb as possible until OOM
happens, and we can see multiple wraparounds of sk->sk_rmem_alloc.

Let's fix it by using atomic_add_return() and comparing the two
variables as unsigned int.

CVE-2025-38466	2025-07-25T16:15:32.673	2025-07-29T14:14:55.157	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf: Revert to requiring CAP_SYS_ADMIN for uprobes

Jann reports that uprobes can be used destructively when used in the
middle of an instruction. The kernel only verifies there is a valid
instruction at the requested offset, but due to variable instruction
length cannot determine if this is an instruction as seen by the
intended execution stream.

Additionally, Mark Rutland notes that on architectures that mix data
in the text segment (like arm64), a similar things can be done if the
data word is 'mistaken' for an instruction.

As such, require CAP_SYS_ADMIN for uprobes."

net/sched: Return NULL when htb_lookup_leaf encounters an empty rbtree

htb_lookup_leaf has a BUG_ON that can trigger with the following:

tc qdisc del dev lo root
tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: htb default 1
tc class add dev lo parent 1: classid 1:1 htb rate 64bit
tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:1 handle 2: netem
tc qdisc add dev lo parent 2:1 handle 3: blackhole
ping -I lo -c1 -W0.001 127.0.0.1

The root cause is the following:

1. htb_dequeue calls htb_dequeue_tree which calls the dequeue handler on
   the selected leaf qdisc
2. netem_dequeue calls enqueue on the child qdisc
3. blackhole_enqueue drops the packet and returns a value that is not
   just NET_XMIT_SUCCESS
4. Because of this, netem_dequeue calls qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog, and
   since qlen is now 0, it calls htb_qlen_notify -> htb_deactivate ->
   htb_deactiviate_prios -> htb_remove_class_from_row -> htb_safe_rb_erase
5. As this is the only class in the selected hprio rbtree,
   __rb_change_child in __rb_erase_augmented sets the rb_root pointer to
   NULL
6. Because blackhole_dequeue returns NULL, netem_dequeue returns NULL,
   which causes htb_dequeue_tree to call htb_lookup_leaf with the same
   hprio rbtree, and fail the BUG_ON

The function graph for this scenario is shown here:

We can fix this just by returning NULL instead of the BUG_ON,

CVE-2025-38470	2025-07-28T12:15:28.760	2025-08-28T15:15:49.170	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: vlan: fix VLAN 0 refcount imbalance of toggling filtering during runtime

Assuming the ""rx-vlan-filter"" feature is enabled on a net device, the
8021q module will automatically add or remove VLAN 0 when the net device
is put administratively up or down, respectively. There are a couple of
problems with the above scheme.

The first problem is a memory leak that can happen if the ""rx-vlan-filter""
feature is disabled while the device is running:

 # ip link add bond1 up type bond mode 0
 # ethtool -K bond1 rx-vlan-filter off
 # ip link del dev bond1

When the device is put administratively down the ""rx-vlan-filter""
feature is disabled, so the 8021q module will not remove VLAN 0 and the
memory will be leaked [1].

Another problem that can happen is that the kernel can automatically
delete VLAN 0 when the device is put administratively down despite not
adding it when the device was put administratively up since during that
time the ""rx-vlan-filter"" feature was disabled. null-ptr-unref or
bug_on[2] will be triggered by unregister_vlan_dev() for refcount
imbalance if toggling filtering during runtime:

$ ip link add bond0 type bond mode 0
$ ip link add link bond0 name vlan0 type vlan id 0 protocol 802.1q
$ ethtool -K bond0 rx-vlan-filter off
$ ifconfig bond0 up
$ ethtool -K bond0 rx-vlan-filter on
$ ifconfig bond0 down
$ ip link del vlan0

Root cause is as below:
step1: add vlan0 for real_dev, such as bond, team.
register_vlan_dev
    vlan_vid_add(real_dev,htons(ETH_P_8021Q),0) //refcnt=1
step2: disable vlan filter feature and enable real_dev
step3: change filter from 0 to 1
vlan_device_event
    vlan_filter_push_vids
        ndo_vlan_rx_add_vid //No refcnt added to real_dev vlan0
step4: real_dev down
vlan_device_event
    vlan_vid_del(dev, htons(ETH_P_8021Q), 0); //refcnt=0
        vlan_info_rcu_free //free vlan0
step5: delete vlan0
unregister_vlan_dev
    BUG_ON(!vlan_info); //vlan_info is null

Fix both problems by noting in the VLAN info whether VLAN 0 was
automatically added upon NETDEV_UP and based on that decide whether it
should be deleted upon NETDEV_DOWN, regardless of the state of the
""rx-vlan-filter"" feature.

netfilter: nf_conntrack: fix crash due to removal of uninitialised entry

A crash in conntrack was reported while trying to unlink the conntrack
entry from the hash bucket list:
    [exception RIP: __nf_ct_delete_from_lists+172]
    [..]
 #7 [ff539b5a2b043aa0] nf_ct_delete at ffffffffc124d421 [nf_conntrack]
 #8 [ff539b5a2b043ad0] nf_ct_gc_expired at ffffffffc124d999 [nf_conntrack]
 #9 [ff539b5a2b043ae0] __nf_conntrack_find_get at ffffffffc124efbc [nf_conntrack]
    [..]

The nf_conn struct is marked as allocated from slab but appears to be in
a partially initialised state:

 ct hlist pointer is garbage; looks like the ct hash value
 (hence crash).
 ct->status is equal to IPS_CONFIRMED|IPS_DYING, which is expected
 ct->timeout is 30000 (=30s), which is unexpected.

Everything else looks like normal udp conntrack entry.  If we ignore
ct->status and pretend its 0, the entry matches those that are newly
allocated but not yet inserted into the hash:
  - ct hlist pointers are overloaded and store/cache the raw tuple hash
  - ct->timeout matches the relative time expected for a new udp flow
    rather than the absolute 'jiffies' value.

If it were not for the presence of IPS_CONFIRMED,
__nf_conntrack_find_get() would have skipped the entry.

Theory is that we did hit following race:

cpu x 			cpu y			cpu z
 found entry E		found entry E
 E is expired		<preemption>
 nf_ct_delete()
 return E to rcu slab
					init_conntrack
					E is re-inited,
					ct->status set to 0
					reply tuplehash hnnode.pprev
					stores hash value.

cpu y found E right before it was deleted on cpu x.
E is now re-inited on cpu z.  cpu y was preempted before
checking for expiry and/or confirm bit.

					->refcnt set to 1
					E now owned by skb
					->timeout set to 30000

If cpu y were to resume now, it would observe E as
expired but would skip E due to missing CONFIRMED bit.

					nf_conntrack_confirm gets called
					sets: ct->status |= CONFIRMED
					This is wrong: E is not yet added
					to hashtable.

cpu y resumes, it observes E as expired but CONFIRMED:
			<resumes>
			nf_ct_expired()
			 -> yes (ct->timeout is 30s)
			confirmed bit set.

cpu y will try to delete E from the hashtable:
			nf_ct_delete() -> set DYING bit
			__nf_ct_delete_from_lists

Even this scenario doesn't guarantee a crash:
cpu z still holds the table bucket lock(s) so y blocks:

			wait for spinlock held by z

					CONFIRMED is set but there is no
					guarantee ct will be added to hash:
					""chaintoolong"" or ""clash resolution""
					logic both skip the insert step.
					reply hnnode.pprev still stores the
					hash value.

					unlocks spinlock
					return NF_DROP
			<unblocks, then
			 crashes on hlist_nulls_del_rcu pprev>

In case CPU z does insert the entry into the hashtable, cpu y will unlink
E again right away but no crash occurs.

Without 'cpu y' race, 'garbage' hlist is of no consequence:
ct refcnt remains at 1, eventually skb will be free'd and E gets
destroyed via: nf_conntrack_put -> nf_conntrack_destroy -> nf_ct_destroy.

To resolve this, move the IPS_CONFIRMED assignment after the table
insertion but before the unlock.

Pablo points out that the confirm-bit-store could be reordered to happen
before hlist add resp. the timeout fixup, so switch to set_bit and
before_atomic memory barrier to prevent this.

It doesn't matter if other CPUs can observe a newly inserted entry right
before the CONFIRMED bit was set:

Such event cannot be distinguished from above ""E is the old incarnation""
case: the entry will be skipped.

Also change nf_ct_should_gc() to first check the confirmed bit.

The gc sequence is:
 1. Check if entry has expired, if not skip to next entry
 2. Obtain a reference to the expired entry.
 3. Call nf_ct_should_gc() to double-check step 1.

nf_ct_should_gc() is thus called only for entries that already failed an
expiry check. After this patch, once the confirmed bit check pas

smc: Fix various oops due to inet_sock type confusion.

syzbot reported weird splats [0][1] in cipso_v4_sock_setattr() while
freeing inet_sk(sk)->inet_opt.

The address was freed multiple times even though it was read-only memory.

cipso_v4_sock_setattr() did nothing wrong, and the root cause was type
confusion.

The cited commit made it possible to create smc_sock as an INET socket.

The issue is that struct smc_sock does not have struct inet_sock as the
first member but hijacks AF_INET and AF_INET6 sk_family, which confuses
various places.

In this case, inet_sock.inet_opt was actually smc_sock.clcsk_data_ready(),
which is an address of a function in the text segment.

  $ pahole -C inet_sock vmlinux
  struct inet_sock {
  ...
          struct ip_options_rcu *    inet_opt;             /*   784     8 */

  $ pahole -C smc_sock vmlinux
  struct smc_sock {
  ...
          void                       (*clcsk_data_ready)(struct sock *); /*   784     8 */

The same issue for another field was reported before. [2][3]

At that time, an ugly hack was suggested [4], but it makes both INET
and SMC code error-prone and hard to change.

Also, yet another variant was fixed by a hacky commit 98d4435efcbf3
(""net/smc: prevent NULL pointer dereference in txopt_get"").

Instead of papering over the root cause by such hacks, we should not
allow non-INET socket to reuse the INET infra.

Let's add inet_sock as the first member of smc_sock.

comedi: Fix initialization of data for instructions that write to subdevice

Some Comedi subdevice instruction handlers are known to access
instruction data elements beyond the first `insn->n` elements in some
cases.  The `do_insn_ioctl()` and `do_insnlist_ioctl()` functions
allocate at least `MIN_SAMPLES` (16) data elements to deal with this,
but they do not initialize all of that.  For Comedi instruction codes
that write to the subdevice, the first `insn->n` data elements are
copied from user-space, but the remaining elements are left
uninitialized.  That could be a problem if the subdevice instruction
handler reads the uninitialized data.  Ensure that the first
`MIN_SAMPLES` elements are initialized before calling these instruction
handlers, filling the uncopied elements with 0.  For
`do_insnlist_ioctl()`, the same data buffer elements are used for
handling a list of instructions, so ensure the first `MIN_SAMPLES`
elements are initialized for each instruction that writes to the
subdevice."

comedi: Fix use of uninitialized data in insn_rw_emulate_bits()

For Comedi `INSN_READ` and `INSN_WRITE` instructions on ""digital""
subdevices (subdevice types `COMEDI_SUBD_DI`, `COMEDI_SUBD_DO`, and
`COMEDI_SUBD_DIO`), it is common for the subdevice driver not to have
`insn_read` and `insn_write` handler functions, but to have an
`insn_bits` handler function for handling Comedi `INSN_BITS`
instructions.  In that case, the subdevice's `insn_read` and/or
`insn_write` function handler pointers are set to point to the
`insn_rw_emulate_bits()` function by `__comedi_device_postconfig()`.

For `INSN_WRITE`, `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` currently assumes that the
supplied `data[0]` value is a valid copy from user memory.  It will at
least exist because `do_insnlist_ioctl()` and `do_insn_ioctl()` in
""comedi_fops.c"" ensure at lease `MIN_SAMPLES` (16) elements are
allocated.  However, if `insn->n` is 0 (which is allowable for
`INSN_READ` and `INSN_WRITE` instructions, then `data[0]` may contain
uninitialized data, and certainly contains invalid data, possibly from a
different instruction in the array of instructions handled by
`do_insnlist_ioctl()`.  This will result in an incorrect value being
written to the digital output channel (or to the digital input/output
channel if configured as an output), and may be reflected in the
internal saved state of the channel.

Fix it by returning 0 early if `insn->n` is 0, before reaching the code
that accesses `data[0]`.  Previously, the function always returned 1 on
success, but it is supposed to be the number of data samples actually
read or written up to `insn->n`, which is 0 in this case."

Dan has also reported following issues with the original patch
https://lore.kernel.org/all/33fe8fe7-719a-405a-9ed2-d9f816ce1d57@sabinyo.mountain/

Bug #1:
The zeroeth element of ctrl->pconfig[] is supposed to be unused.  We
start counting at 1.  However this code sets ctrl->pconfig[0].ch_mask = 128.

Bug #2:
There are SLIM_MAX_TX_PORTS (16) elements in tx_ch[] array but only
QCOM_SDW_MAX_PORTS + 1 (15) in the ctrl->pconfig[] array so it corrupts
memory like Yongqin Liu pointed out.

Bug 3:
Like Jie Gan pointed out, it erases all the tx information with the rx
information."

CVE-2025-38488	2025-07-28T12:15:30.857	2025-08-28T15:15:50.700	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: fix use-after-free in crypt_message when using async crypto

The CVE-2024-50047 fix removed asynchronous crypto handling from
crypt_message(), assuming all crypto operations are synchronous.
However, when hardware crypto accelerators are used, this can cause
use-after-free crashes:

  crypt_message()
    // Allocate the creq buffer containing the req
    creq = smb2_get_aead_req(..., &req);

    // Async encryption returns -EINPROGRESS immediately
    rc = enc ? crypto_aead_encrypt(req) : crypto_aead_decrypt(req);

    // Free creq while async operation is still in progress
    kvfree_sensitive(creq, ...);

Hardware crypto modules often implement async AEAD operations for
performance. When crypto_aead_encrypt/decrypt() returns -EINPROGRESS,
the operation completes asynchronously. Without crypto_wait_req(),
the function immediately frees the request buffer, leading to crashes
when the driver later accesses the freed memory.

This results in a use-after-free condition when the hardware crypto
driver later accesses the freed request structure, leading to kernel
crashes with NULL pointer dereferences.

The issue occurs because crypto_alloc_aead() with mask=0 doesn't
guarantee synchronous operation. Even without CRYPTO_ALG_ASYNC in
the mask, async implementations can be selected.

Fix by restoring the async crypto handling:
- DECLARE_CRYPTO_WAIT(wait) for completion tracking
- aead_request_set_callback() for async completion notification
- crypto_wait_req() to wait for operation completion

This ensures the request buffer isn't freed until the crypto operation
completes, whether synchronous or asynchronous, while preserving the
CVE-2024-50047 fix."

CVE-2025-38492	2025-07-28T12:15:31.367	2025-07-29T14:14:29.590	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfs: Fix race between cache write completion and ALL_QUEUED being set

When netfslib is issuing subrequests, the subrequests start processing
immediately and may complete before we reach the end of the issuing
function.  At the end of the issuing function we set NETFS_RREQ_ALL_QUEUED
to indicate to the collector that we aren't going to issue any more subreqs
and that it can do the final notifications and cleanup.

Now, this isn't a problem if the request is synchronous
(NETFS_RREQ_OFFLOAD_COLLECTION is unset) as the result collection will be
done in-thread and we're guaranteed an opportunity to run the collector.

However, if the request is asynchronous, collection is primarily triggered
by the termination of subrequests queuing it on a workqueue.  Now, a race
can occur here if the app thread sets ALL_QUEUED after the last subrequest
terminates.

This can happen most easily with the copy2cache code (as used by Ceph)
where, in the collection routine of a read request, an asynchronous write
request is spawned to copy data to the cache.  Folios are added to the
write request as they're unlocked, but there may be a delay before
ALL_QUEUED is set as the write subrequests may complete before we get
there.

If all the write subreqs have finished by the ALL_QUEUED point, no further
events happen and the collection never happens, leaving the request
hanging.

Fix this by queuing the collector after setting ALL_QUEUED.  This is a bit
heavy-handed and it may be sufficient to do it only if there are no extant
subreqs.

Also add a tracepoint to cross-reference both requests in a copy-to-request
operation and add a trace to the netfs_rreq tracepoint to indicate the
setting of ALL_QUEUED."

field with __counted_by(size). At the time of the memcpy, entry->size
contains garbage from the ringbuffer, which under some circumstances is
zero, triggering a kernel panic by buffer overflow.

Populate the size field before the memcpy so that the out-of-bounds
check knows the correct size. This is analogous to
__ftrace_trace_stack()."

As a workaround, switch to the GD image handler (`gd`, the default handler), which is not affected by either vulnerability. For file upload scenarios, instead of using user-provided filenames, generate random names to eliminate the attack vector with `getRandomName()` when using the `move()` method, or use the `store()` method, which automatically generates safe filenames.

In version 5.0.1, Node-SAML loads the assertion from the (unsigned) original response document. This is different than the parts that are verified when checking signature. This allows an attacker to modify authentication details within a valid SAML assertion. For example, in one attack it is possible to remove any character from the SAML assertion username. To conduct the attack an attacker would need a validly signed document from the identity provider (IdP). This is fixed in version 5.1.0.	10.0	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N

CVE-2025-54426	2025-07-28T21:15:26.887	2025-07-29T14:14:29.590	Polkadot Frontier is an Ethereum and EVM compatibility layer for Polkadot and Substrate. In versions prior to commit 36f70d1, the Curve25519Add and Curve25519ScalarMul precompiles incorrectly handle invalid Ristretto point representations. Instead of returning an error, they silently treat invalid input bytes as the Ristretto identity element, leading to potentially incorrect cryptographic results. This is fixed in commit 36f70d1.					
CVE-2025-54427	2025-07-28T21:15:27.080	2025-07-29T14:14:29.590	Polkadot Frontier is an Ethereum and EVM compatibility layer for Polkadot and Substrate. The extrinsic note_min_gas_price_target is an inherent extrinsic, meaning only the block producer can call it. To ensure correctness, the ProvideInherent trait should be implemented for each inherent, which includes the check_inherent call. This allows other nodes to verify if the input (in this case, the target value) is correct. However, prior to commit a754b3d, the check_inherent function has not been implemented for note_min_gas_price_target. This lets the block producer set the target value without verification. The target is then used to set the MinGasPrice, which has an upper and lower bound defined in the on_initialize hook. The block producer can set the target to the upper bound. Which also increases the upper and lower bounds for the next block. Over time, this could result in continuously raising the gas price, making contract execution too expensive and ineffective for users. An attacker could use this flaw to manipulate the gas price, potentially leading to significantly inflated transaction fees. Such manipulation could render contract execution prohibitively expensive for users, effectively resulting in a denial-of-service condition for the network. This is fixed in version a754b3d.					
CVE-2025-54428	2025-07-28T21:15:27.327	2025-07-29T14:14:29.590	RevelaCode is an AI-powered faith-tech project that decodes biblical verses, prophecies and global events into accessible language. In versions below 1.0.1, a valid MongoDB Atlas URI with embedded username and password was accidentally committed to the public repository. This could allow unauthorized access to production or staging databases, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. This is fixed in version 1.0.1. Workarounds include: immediately rotating credentials for the exposed database user, using a secret manager (like Vault, Doppler, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) instead of storing secrets directly in code, or auditing recent access logs for suspicious activity.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2025-54429	2025-07-28T21:15:27.647	2025-07-29T14:14:29.590	Polkadot Frontier is an Ethereum and EVM compatibility layer for Polkadot and Substrate. There are various account address types in Frontier, e.g. precompiled contracts, smart contracts, and externally owned accounts. Some EVM mechanisms should be unreachable by certain types of accounts for safety. For precompiles to be callable by smart contracts they must be explicitly configured as CallableByContract. If this configuration is absent, then the precompile should be unreachable via smart contract accounts. In commits prior to 0822030, the underlying implementation of CallableByContract which returned the AddressType was incorrect. It considered the contract address running under CREATE or CREATE2 to be AddressType::EOA rather than correctly as AddressType::Contract. The issue only affects users who use custom precompile implementations that utilize AddressType::EOA and AddressType::Contract. It's not directly exploitable in any of the predefined precompiles in Frontier. This is fixed in version 0822030.

CVE-2025-54422	2025-07-29T13:15:27.823	2025-08-04T17:30:08.827	Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems. In versions 1.16.1 and below, a critical security vulnerability exists in password handling mechanisms. During encrypted sandbox creation, user passwords are transmitted via shared memory, exposing them to potential interception. The vulnerability is particularly severe during password modification operations, where both old and new passwords are passed as plaintext command-line arguments to the Imbox process without any encryption or obfuscation. This implementation flaw allows any process within the user session, including unprivileged processes, to retrieve these sensitive credentials by reading the command-line arguments, thereby bypassing standard privilege requirements and creating a significant security risk.

In versions 1.4.0 until 1.4.19, the file upload processing system contains an SSRF vulnerability that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to force the server to make arbitrary HTTP requests. The vulnerability stems from the multipart form data and JSON request handlers, which automatically download files from user-provided URLs without validating whether those URLs point to internal network addresses, cloud metadata endpoints, or other restricted resources. The documentation explicitly promotes this URL-based file upload feature, making it an intended design that exposes all deployed services to SSRF attacks by default.

In versions 28.2.0 through 28.3.2, when the firewalld service is reloaded it removes all iptables rules including those created by Docker. While Docker should automatically recreate these rules, versions before 28.3.3 fail to recreate the specific rules that block external access to containers. This means that after a firewalld reload, containers with ports published to localhost (like 127.0.0.1:8080) become accessible from remote machines that have network routing to the Docker bridge, even though they should only be accessible from the host itself. The vulnerability only affects explicitly published ports - unpublished ports remain protected. This issue is fixed in version 28.3.3.	4.6	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

A firewalld vulnerability affects Moby releases before 28.0.0. When firewalld reloads, Docker fails to re-create iptables rules that isolate bridge networks, allowing any container to access all ports on any other container across different bridge networks on the same host. This breaks network segmentation between containers that should be isolated, creating significant risk in multi-tenant environments. Only containers in --internal networks remain protected.
Workarounds include reloading firewalld and either restarting the docker daemon, re-creating bridge networks, or using rootless mode. Maintainers anticipate a fix for this issue in version 25.0.13."	3.3	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N		
CVE-2025-54425	2025-07-30T14:15:29.073	2025-09-22T13:53:07.130	Umbraco is an ASP.NET CMS. In versions 13.0.0 through 13.9.2, 15.0.0 through 15.4.1 and 16.0.0 through 16.1.0, the content delivery API can be restricted from public access where an API key must be provided in a header to authorize the request. It's also possible to configure output caching, such that the delivery API outputs will be cached for a period of time, improving performance. There's an issue when these two things are used together, where caching doesn't vary by the header that contains the API key. As such, it's possible for a user without a valid API key to retrieve a response for a given path and query if it has recently been requested and cached by request with a valid key. This is fixed in versions 13.9.3, 15.4.4 and 16.1.1.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2025-54430	2025-07-30T14:15:29.257	2025-07-31T18:42:37.870	dedupe is a python library that uses machine learning to perform fuzzy matching, deduplication and entity resolution quickly on structured data. Before commit 3f61e79, a critical severity vulnerability has been identified within the .github/workflows/benchmark-bot.yml workflow, where a issue_comment can be triggered using the @benchmark body. This workflow is susceptible to exploitation as it checkout the ${{ github.event.issue.number }}, which correspond to the branch of the PR manipulated by potentially malicious actors, and where untrusted code may be executed. Running untrusted code may lead to the exfiltration of GITHUB_TOKEN, which in this workflow has write permissions on most of the scopes - in particular the contents one - and could lead to potential repository takeover.

This issue is fixed in versions 2.1.11 and 3.1.11.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L		
CVE-2025-54576	2025-07-30T20:15:37.677	2025-09-10T14:36:50.243	OAuth2-Proxy is an open-source tool that can act as either a standalone reverse proxy or a middleware component integrated into existing reverse proxy or load balancer setups. In versions 7.10.0 and below, oauth2-proxy deployments are vulnerable when using the skip_auth_routes configuration option with regex patterns. Attackers can bypass authentication by crafting URLs with query parameters that satisfy configured regex patterns, allowing unauthorized access to protected resources. The issue stems from skip_auth_routes matching against the full request URI. Deployments using skip_auth_routes with regex patterns containing wildcards or broad matching patterns are most at risk. This issue is fixed in version 7.11.0. Workarounds include: auditing all skip_auth_routes configurations for overly permissive patterns, replacing wildcard patterns with exact path matches where possible, ensuring regex patterns are properly anchored (starting with ^ and ending with $), or implementing custom validation that strips query parameters before regex matching.	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2025-54581	2025-07-30T20:15:37.907	2025-07-31T18:42:37.870	vproxy is an HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS5 proxy server. In versions 2.3.3 and below, untrusted data is extracted from the user-controlled HTTP Proxy-Authorization header and passed to Extension::try_from and flows into parse_ttl_extension where it is parsed as a TTL value. If an attacker supplies a TTL of zero (e.g. by using a username such as 'configuredUser-ttl-0'), the modulo operation 'timestamp % ttl' will cause a division by zero panic, causing the server to crash causing a denial-of-service. This is fixed in version 2.4.0.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

In versions 1.19.1 and below, an attacker can craft a malicious Git packfile to exploit the PACK signature detection in the parsePush.ts file. By embedding a misleading PACK signature within commit content and carefully constructing the packet structure, the attacker can trick the parser into treating invalid or unintended data as the packfile. Potentially, this would allow bypassing approval or hiding commits. This issue is fixed in version 1.19.2.	5.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

In versions 1.19.1 and below, attackers can exploit the way GitProxy handles new branch creation to bypass the approval of prior commits on the parent branch. The vulnerability impacts all users or organizations relying on GitProxy to enforce policy and prevent unapproved changes. It requires no elevated privileges beyond regular push access, and no extra user interaction. It does however, require a GitProxy administrator or designated user (canUserApproveRejectPush) to approve pushes to the child branch.

CVE-2025-54586	2025-07-30T22:15:25.120	2025-08-01T20:03:03.700	GitProxy is an application that stands between developers and a Git remote endpoint. In versions 1.19.1 and below,   attackers can inject extra commits into the pack sent to GitHub, commits that aren’t pointed to by any branch. Although these “hidden” commits never show up in the repository’s visible history, GitHub still serves them at their direct commit URLs. This lets an attacker exfiltrate sensitive data without ever leaving a trace in the branch view. We rate this a High‑impact vulnerability because it completely compromises repository confidentiality.

When an attacker sends a specially crafted password string, the application fails to validate input length, resulting in memory corruption. This can lead to denial of service or arbitrary code execution. Exploitation requires the anonymous user account to be enabled.					
CVE-2013-10043	2025-07-31T15:15:34.313	2025-07-31T18:42:37.870	A vulnerability exists in OAstium VoIP PBX astium-confweb-2.1-25399 and earlier, where improper input validation in the logon.php script allows an attacker to bypass authentication via SQL injection. Once authenticated as an administrator, the attacker can upload arbitrary PHP code through the importcompany field in import.php, resulting in remote code execution. The malicious payload is injected into /usr/local/astium/web/php/config.php and executed with root privileges by triggering a configuration reload via sudo /sbin/service astcfgd reload. Successful exploitation leads to full system compromise.					
CVE-2014-125121	2025-07-31T15:15:34.470	2025-07-31T18:42:37.870	"Array Networks vAPV (version 8.3.2.17) and vxAG (version 9.2.0.34) appliances are affected by a privilege escalation vulnerability caused by a combination of hardcoded SSH credentials (or SSH private key) and insecure permissions on a startup script. The devices ship with a default SSH login or a hardcoded DSA private key, allowing an attacker to authenticate remotely with limited privileges.


Once authenticated, an attacker can overwrite the world-writable /ca/bin/monitor.sh script with arbitrary commands. Since this script is executed with elevated privileges through the backend binary, enabling the debug monitor via backend -c ""debug monitor on"" triggers execution of the attacker's payload as root. This allows full system compromise."					
CVE-2014-125122	2025-07-31T15:15:34.620	2025-07-31T18:42:37.870	A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the tmUnblock.cgi endpoint of the Linksys WRT120N wireless router. The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request with an overly long TM_Block_URL parameter to the endpoint. By exploiting this flaw, an unauthenticated remote attacker can overwrite memory in a controlled manner, enabling them to temporarily reset the administrator password of the device to a blank value. This grants unauthorized access to the router’s web management interface without requiring valid credentials.					
CVE-2014-125123	2025-07-31T15:15:34.770	2025-07-31T18:42:37.870	An unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability exists in the Kloxo web hosting control panel (developed by LXCenter) prior to version 6.1.12. The flaw resides in the login-name parameter passed to lbin/webcommand.php, which fails to properly sanitize input, allowing an attacker to extract the administrator’s password from the backend database. After recovering valid credentials, the attacker can authenticate to the Kloxo control panel and leverage the Command Center feature (display.php) to execute arbitrary operating system commands as root on the underlying host system. This vulnerability was reported to be exploited in the wild in January 2014.					
CVE-2014-125124	2025-07-31T15:15:34.913	2025-07-31T18:42:37.870	An unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability exists in Pandora FMS versions up to and including 5.0RC1 via the Anyterm web interface, which listens on TCP port 8023. The anyterm-module endpoint accepts unsanitized user input via the p parameter and directly injects it into a shell command, allowing arbitrary command execution as the pandora user. In certain versions (notably 4.1 and 5.0RC1), the pandora user can elevate privileges to root without a password using a chain involving the artica user account. This account is typically installed without a password and is configured to run sudo without authentication. Therefore, full system compromise is possible without any credentials.					
CVE-2014-125125	2025-07-31T15:15:35.063	2025-07-31T18:42:37.870	A path traversal vulnerability exists in A10 Networks AX Loadbalancer versions 2.6.1-GR1-P5, 2.7.0, and earlier. The vulnerability resides in the handling of the filename parameter in the /xml/downloads endpoint, which fails to properly sanitize user input. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this flaw by sending crafted HTTP requests containing directory traversal sequences to read arbitrary files outside the intended directory. The files returned by the vulnerable endpoint are deleted from the system after retrieval. This can lead to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information such as SSL certificates and private keys, as well as unintended file deletion.					
CVE-2014-125126	2025-07-31T15:15:35.210	2025-07-31T18:42:37.870	An unrestricted file upload vulnerability exists in Simple E-Document versions 3.0 to 3.1 that allows an unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication by sending a specific cookie header (access=3) with HTTP requests. The application’s upload mechanism fails to restrict file types and does not validate or sanitize user-supplied input, allowing attackers to upload malicious .php scripts. Authentication can be bypassed entirely by supplying a specially crafted cookie (access=3), granting access to the upload functionality without valid credentials. If file uploads are enabled on the server, the attacker can upload a web shell and gain remote code execution with the privileges of the web server user, potentially leading to full system compromise.					
CVE-2024-34328	2025-07-31T15:15:35.443	2025-07-31T20:15:31.013	An open redirect in Sielox AnyWare v2.1.2 allows attackers to execute a man-in-the-middle attack via a crafted URL.	6.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

This can result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition or, under certain conditions, escape the sandboxed environment intended to restrict code execution. The vulnerability stems from insufficient prototype access checks in the sandbox’s executor logic, particularly in the handling of JavaScript function objects returned.

CVE-2025-50572	2025-07-31T20:15:43.470	2025-08-04T15:06:36.623	An issue was discovered in Archer Technology RSA Archer 6.11.00204.10014 allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted system inputs that would be exported into the CSV and be executed after the user opened the file with compatible applications.	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2025-8286	2025-07-31T20:15:46.350	2025-08-15T21:15:37.030	The affected products expose an unauthenticated Telnet-based command line interface that could allow an attacker to modify hardware configurations, manipulate data, or factory reset the device.					
CVE-2023-32251	2025-07-31T21:15:26.810	2025-08-04T15:06:36.623	A vulnerability has been identified in the Linux kernel's ksmbd component (kernel SMB/CIFS server). A security control designed to prevent dictionary attacks, which introduces a 5-second delay during session setup, can be bypassed through the use of asynchronous requests. This bypass negates the intended anti-brute-force protection, potentially allowing attackers to conduct dictionary attacks more efficiently against user credentials or other authentication mechanisms.	3.7	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2025-23289	2025-07-31T21:15:27.067	2025-08-04T15:06:36.623	NVIDIA Omniverse Launcher for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability in the launcher logs, where a user could cause sensitive information to be written to the log files through proxy servers. A successful exploit of this vulnerability might lead to information disclosure.	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2025-45768	2025-07-31T21:15:27.320	2025-09-12T16:45:51.510	pyjwt v2.10.1 was discovered to contain weak encryption. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because the key length is chosen by the application that uses the library (admittedly, library users may benefit from a minimum value and a mechanism for opting in to strict enforcement).	7.0	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H		
CVE-2025-48071	2025-07-31T21:15:27.990	2025-08-13T19:18:51.740	OpenEXR provides the specification and reference implementation of the EXR file format, an image storage format for the motion picture industry. In versions 3.3.2 through 3.3.0, there is a heap-based buffer overflow during a write operation when decompressing ZIPS-packed deep scan-line EXR files with a maliciously forged chunk header. This is fixed in version 3.3.3.	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2025-48072	2025-07-31T21:15:28.163	2025-08-13T20:23:43.777	OpenEXR provides the specification and reference implementation of the EXR file format, an image storage format for the motion picture industry. Version 3.3.2 is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow during a read operation due to bad pointer math when decompressing DWAA-packed scan-line EXR files with a maliciously forged chunk. This is fixed in version 3.3.3.	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2025-48073	2025-07-31T21:15:28.340	2025-08-13T19:06:51.723	OpenEXR provides the specification and reference implementation of the EXR file format, an image storage format for the motion picture industry. In version 3.3.2, when reading a deep scanline image with a large sample count in reduceMemory mode, it is possible to crash a target application with a NULL pointer dereference in a write operation. This is fixed in version 3.3.3.	6.2	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
