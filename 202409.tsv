A non-admin user is not allowed to create libraries (or access only the ones they have permission to). However, the `LibraryController` is missing the check for admin user and thus allows a path traversal issue. Allowing non-admin users to write to any directory in the system can be seen as a form of path traversal. However, since it can be restricted to only admin permissions, fixing this is relatively simple and falls more into the realm of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

The Jellyfin user profile image upload accepts SVG files, allowing for a stored XSS attack against an admin user via a specially crafted malicious SVG file. When viewed by an admin outside of the Jellyfin Web UI (e.g. via ""view image"" in a browser), this malicious SVG file could interact with the browser's LocalStorage and retrieve an AccessToken, which in turn can be used in an API call to elevate the target user to a Jellyfin administrator. The actual attack vector is unlikely to be exploited, as it requires specific actions by the administrator to view the SVG image outside of Jellyfin's WebUI, i.e. it is not a passive attack. The underlying exploit mechanism is solved by PR #12490, which forces attached images (including the potential malicious SVG) to be treated as attachments and thus downloaded by browsers, rather than viewed. This prevents exploitation of the LocalStorage of the browser. This PR has been merged and the relevant code changes are included in release version 10.9.10.

fuse: Initialize beyond-EOF page contents before setting uptodate

fuse_notify_store(), unlike fuse_do_readpage(), does not enable page
zeroing (because it can be used to change partial page contents).

So fuse_notify_store() must be more careful to fully initialize page
contents (including parts of the page that are beyond end-of-file)
before marking the page uptodate.

The current code can leave beyond-EOF page contents uninitialized, which
makes these uninitialized page contents visible to userspace via mmap().

This is an information leak, but only affects systems which do not
enable init-on-alloc (via CONFIG_INIT_ON_ALLOC_DEFAULT_ON=y or the

CVE-2024-45305	2024-09-02T18:15:36.657	2024-09-03T12:59:02.453	gix-path is a crate of the gitoxide project dealing with git paths and their conversions. `gix-path` executes `git` to find the path of a configuration file that belongs to the `git` installation itself, but mistakenly treats the local repository's configuration as system-wide if no higher scoped configuration is found. In rare cases, this causes a less trusted repository to be treated as more trusted, or leaks sensitive information from one repository to another, such as sending credentials to another repository's remote. In `gix_path::env`, the underlying implementation of the `installation_config` and `installation_config_prefix` functions calls `git config -l --show-origin` and parses the first line of the output to extract the path to the configuration file holding the configuration variable of highest scope. It is believed to be very difficult to exploit this vulnerability deliberately, due to the need either to anticipate a situation in which higher-scoped configuration variables would be absent, or to arrange for this to happen. Although any operating system may be affected, users running Apple Git on macOS are much less likely to be affected. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.10.10.

CVE-2024-45308	2024-09-02T18:15:37.150	2025-09-22T17:27:13.330	HedgeDoc is an open source, real-time, collaborative, markdown notes application. When using HedgeDoc 1 with MySQL or MariaDB, it is possible to create notes with an alias matching the ID of existing notes. The affected existing note can then not be accessed anymore and is effectively hidden by the new one. When the freeURL feature is enabled (by setting the `allowFreeURL` config option or the `CMD_ALLOW_FREEURL` environment variable to `true`), any user with the appropriate permissions can create a note with an arbitrary alias, e.g. by accessing it in the browser. When MySQL or MariaDB are used, it is possible to create a new note with an alias that matches the lower-cased ID of a different note. HedgeDoc then always presents the new note to users, as these databases perform case-insensitive matching and the lower-cased alias is found first. This issue only affects HedgeDoc instances that use MySQL or MariaDB. Depending on the permission settings of the HedgeDoc instance, the issue can be exploited only by logged-in users or by all (including non-logged-in) users. The exploit requires knowledge of the ID of the target note. Attackers could use this issue to present a manipulated copy of the original note to the user, e.g. by replacing the links with malicious ones. Attackers can also use this issue to prevent access to the original note, causing a denial of service. No data is lost, as the original content of the affected notes is still present in the database. Users are advised to upgrade to version 1.10.0 which addresses this issue. Users unable to upgrade may disable freeURL mode which prevents the exploitation of this issue. The impact can also be limited by restricting freeURL note creation to trusted, logged-in users by enabling `requireFreeURLAuthentication`/`CMD_REQUIRE_FREEURL_AUTHENTICATION`.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L

As of quinn-proto 0.11, it is possible for a server to `accept()`, `retry()`, `refuse()`, or `ignore()` an `Incoming` connection. However, calling `retry()` on an unvalidated connection exposes the server to a likely panic in the following situations:  1. Calling `refuse` or `ignore` on the resulting validated connection, if a duplicate initial packet is received. This issue can go undetected until a server's `refuse()`/`ignore()` code path is exercised, such as to stop a denial of service attack. 2. Accepting when the initial packet for the resulting validated connection fails to decrypt or exhausts connection IDs, if a similar initial packet that successfully decrypts and doesn't exhaust connection IDs is received. This issue can go undetected if clients are well-behaved. The former situation was observed in a real application, while the latter is only theoretical.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

When installing Server Pro using the Overleaf Toolkit from before 2024-07-17 or legacy docker-compose.yml from before 2024-08-28, the configuration for LaTeX compiles was insecure by default, requiring the administrator to enable the security features via a configuration setting (`SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED` in Toolkit, `SANDBOXED_COMPILES` in legacy docker-compose/custom deployments). If these security features are not enabled then users have access to the `sharelatex` container resources (filesystem, network, environment variables) when running compiles, leading to multiple file access vulnerabilities, either directly or via symlinks created during compiles. The setting has now been changed to be secure by default for new installs in the Toolkit and legacy docker-compose deployment. The Overleaf Toolkit has been updated to set `SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED=true` by default for new installs. It is recommended that any existing installations using the previous default setting migrate to using sibling containers. Existing installations can set `SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED=true` in `config/overleaf.rc` as a mitigation.

CVE-2024-6119	2024-09-03T16:15:07.177	2025-06-03T10:51:54.117	"Issue summary: Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS
clients checking server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory
address resulting in abnormal termination of the application process.

Impact summary: Abnormal termination of an application can a cause a denial of
service.

Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS clients checking
server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory address when
comparing the expected name with an `otherName` subject alternative name of an
X.509 certificate. This may result in an exception that terminates the
application program.

Note that basic certificate chain validation (signatures, dates, ...) is not
affected, the denial of service can occur only when the application also
specifies an expected DNS name, Email address or IP address.

TLS servers rarely solicit client certificates, and even when they do, they
generally don't perform a name check against a reference identifier (expected
identity), but rather extract the presented identity after checking the
certificate chain.  So TLS servers are generally not affected and the severity
of the issue is Moderate.

CVE-2024-43803	2024-09-03T19:15:14.800	2024-09-03T19:40:46.783	"The Bare Metal Operator (BMO) implements a Kubernetes API for managing bare metal hosts in Metal3. The `BareMetalHost` (BMH) CRD allows the `userData`, `metaData`, and `networkData` for the provisioned host to be specified as links to Kubernetes Secrets. There are fields for both the `Name` and `Namespace` of the Secret, meaning that versions of the baremetal-operator prior to 0.8.0, 0.6.2, and 0.5.2 will read a `Secret` from any namespace. A user with access to create or edit a `BareMetalHost` can thus exfiltrate a `Secret` from another namespace by using it as e.g. the `userData` for provisioning some host (note that this need not be a real host, it could be a VM somewhere).

BMO will only read a key with the name `value` (or `userData`, `metaData`, or `networkData`), so that limits the exposure somewhat. `value` is probably a pretty common key though. Secrets used by _other_ `BareMetalHost`s in different namespaces are always vulnerable. It is probably relatively unusual for anyone other than cluster administrators to have RBAC access to create/edit a `BareMetalHost`. This vulnerability is only meaningful, if the cluster has users other than administrators and users' privileges are limited to their respective namespaces.

The patch prevents BMO from accepting links to Secrets from other namespaces as BMH input. Any BMH configuration is only read from the same namespace only. The problem is patched in BMO releases v0.7.0, v0.6.2 and v0.5.2 and users should upgrade to those versions. Prior upgrading, duplicate the BMC Secrets to the namespace where the corresponding BMH is. After upgrade, remove the old Secrets. As a workaround, an operator can configure BMO RBAC to be namespace scoped for Secrets, instead of cluster scoped, to prevent BMO from accessing Secrets from other namespaces."	4.9	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2024-45307	2024-09-03T19:15:15.033	2024-09-07T01:34:05.907	SudoBot, a Discord moderation bot, is vulnerable to privilege escalation and exploit of the `-config` command in versions prior to 9.26.7. Anyone is theoretically able to update any configuration of the bot and potentially gain control over the bot's settings. Every version of v9 before v9.26.7 is affected. Other versions (e.g. v8) are not affected. Users should upgrade to version 9.26.7 to receive a patch. A workaround would be to create a command permission overwrite in the Database. A SQL statement provided in the GitHub Security Advisor can be executed to create a overwrite that disallows users without `ManageGuild` permission to run the `-config` command. Run the SQL statement for every server the bot is in, and replace `<guild_id>` with the appropriate Guild ID each time.	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:H		
CVE-2024-45310	2024-09-03T19:15:15.243	2025-02-21T18:15:17.080	"runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification. runc 1.1.13 and earlier, as well as 1.2.0-rc2 and earlier, can be tricked into creating empty files or directories in arbitrary locations in the host filesystem by sharing a volume between two containers and exploiting a race with `os.MkdirAll`. While this could be used to create empty files, existing files would not be truncated. An attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom volume configuration. Containers using user namespaces are still affected, but the scope of places an attacker can create inodes can be significantly reduced. Sufficiently strict LSM policies (SELinux/Apparmor) can also in principle block this attack -- we suspect the industry standard SELinux policy may restrict this attack's scope but the exact scope of protection hasn't been analysed. This is exploitable using runc directly as well as through Docker and Kubernetes. The issue is fixed in runc v1.1.14 and v1.2.0-rc3.

Some workarounds are available. Using user namespaces restricts this attack fairly significantly such that the attacker can only create inodes in directories that the remapped root user/group has write access to. Unless the root user is remapped to an actual
user on the host (such as with rootless containers that don't use `/etc/sub[ug]id`), this in practice means that an attacker would only be able to create inodes in world-writable directories. A strict enough SELinux or AppArmor policy could in principle also restrict the scope if a specific label is applied to the runc runtime, though neither the extent to which the standard existing policies block this attack nor what exact policies are needed to sufficiently restrict this attack have been thoroughly tested."	3.6	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N

This information is gathered by looking up the value of `document.currentScript.src`. Prior to Pagefind version 1.1.1, it is possible to ""clobber"" this lookup with otherwise benign HTML on the page. This will cause `document.currentScript.src` to resolve as an external domain, which will then be used by Pagefind to load dependencies. This exploit would only work in the case that an attacker could inject HTML to a live, hosted, website. In these cases, this would act as a way to escalate the privilege available to an attacker. This assumes they have the ability to add some elements to the page (for example, `img` tags with a `name` attribute), but not others, as adding a `script` to the page would itself be the cross-site scripting vector. Pagefind has tightened this resolution in version 1.1.1 by ensuring the source is loaded from a valid script element.

CVE-2024-43402	2024-09-04T16:15:06.640	2024-10-01T15:12:09.593	Rust is a programming language. The fix for CVE-2024-24576, where `std::process::Command` incorrectly escaped arguments when invoking batch files on Windows, was incomplete. Prior to Rust version 1.81.0, it was possible to bypass the fix when the batch file name had trailing whitespace or periods (which are ignored and stripped by Windows). To determine whether to apply the `cmd.exe` escaping rules, the original fix for the vulnerability checked whether the command name ended with `.bat` or `.cmd`. At the time that seemed enough, as we refuse to invoke batch scripts with no file extension. Windows removes trailing whitespace and periods when parsing file paths. For example, `.bat. .` is interpreted by Windows as `.bat`, but the original fix didn't check for that. Affected users who are using Rust 1.77.2 or greater can remove the trailing whitespace (ASCII 0x20) and trailing periods (ASCII 0x2E) from the batch file name to bypass the incomplete fix and enable the mitigations. Users are affected if their code or one of their dependencies invoke a batch script on Windows with trailing whitespace or trailing periods in the name, and pass untrusted arguments to it. Rust 1.81.0 will update the standard library to apply the CVE-2024-24576 mitigations to all batch files invocations, regardless of the trailing chars in the file name.	8.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2024-43405	2024-09-04T16:15:06.853	2024-10-01T15:37:37.337	Nuclei is a vulnerability scanner powered by YAML based templates. Starting in version 3.0.0 and prior to version 3.3.2, a vulnerability in Nuclei's template signature verification system could allow an attacker to bypass the signature check and possibly execute malicious code via custom code template. The vulnerability is present in the template signature verification process, specifically in the `signer` package. The vulnerability stems from a discrepancy between how the signature verification process and the YAML parser handle newline characters, combined with the way multiple signatures are processed. This allows an attacker to inject malicious content into a template while maintaining a valid signature for the benign part of the template. CLI users are affected if they execute custom code templates from unverified sources. This includes templates authored by third parties or obtained from unverified repositories. SDK Users are affected if they are developers integrating Nuclei into their platforms, particularly if they permit the execution of custom code templates by end-users. The vulnerability is addressed in Nuclei v3.3.2. Users are strongly recommended to update to this version to mitigate the security risk. As an interim measure, users should refrain from using custom templates if unable to upgrade immediately. Only trusted, verified templates should be executed. Those who are unable to upgrade Nuclei should disable running custom code templates as a workaround.	7.4	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N

Prior to version 2.44.0, a timing-based username enumeration vulnerability exists in Fides Webserver authentication. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to determine the existence of valid usernames by analyzing the time it takes for the server to respond to login requests. The discrepancy in response times between valid and invalid usernames can be leveraged to enumerate users on the system. This vulnerability enables a timing-based username enumeration attack. An attacker can systematically guess and verify which usernames are valid by measuring the server's response time to authentication requests. This information can be used to conduct further attacks on authentication such as password brute-forcing and credential stuffing. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.44.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. There are no workarounds.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

x86/mtrr: Check if fixed MTRRs exist before saving them

MTRRs have an obsolete fixed variant for fine grained caching control
of the 640K-1MB region that uses separate MSRs. This fixed variant has
a separate capability bit in the MTRR capability MSR.

So far all x86 CPUs which support MTRR have this separate bit set, so it
went unnoticed that mtrr_save_state() does not check the capability bit
before accessing the fixed MTRR MSRs.

Though on a CPU that does not support the fixed MTRR capability this
results in a #GP.  The #GP itself is harmless because the RDMSR fault is
handled gracefully, but results in a WARN_ON().

parisc: fix a possible DMA corruption

using cached write, the value that was written with DMA may be
corrupted.

This commit changes ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN to be 128 on PA20 and 32 on PA1.1 -
that's the largest possible cache line size.

As different parisc microarchitectures have different cache line size, we
define arch_slab_minalign(), cache_line_size() and

serial: sc16is7xx: fix TX fifo corruption

Sometimes, when a packet is received on channel A at almost the same time
as a packet is about to be transmitted on channel B, we observe with a
logic analyzer that the received packet on channel A is transmitted on
channel B. In other words, the Tx buffer data on channel B is corrupted
with data from channel A.

The problem appeared since commit 4409df5866b7 (""serial: sc16is7xx: change
EFR lock to operate on each channels""), which changed the EFR locking to
operate on each channel instead of chip-wise.

This commit has introduced a regression, because the EFR lock is used not
only to protect the EFR registers access, but also, in a very obscure and
undocumented way, to protect access to the data buffer, which is shared by
the Tx and Rx handlers, but also by each channel of the IC.

Fix this regression first by switching to kfifo_out_linear_ptr() in
sc16is7xx_handle_tx() to eliminate the need for a shared Rx/Tx buffer.

Secondly, replace the chip-wise Rx buffer with a separate Rx buffer for
each channel."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

idpf: fix memory leaks and crashes while performing a soft reset

The second tagged commit introduced a UAF, as it removed restoring
q_vector->vport pointers after reinitializating the structures.
This is due to that all queue allocation functions are performed here
with the new temporary vport structure and those functions rewrite
the backpointers to the vport. Then, this new struct is freed and
the pointers start leading to nowhere.

But generally speaking, the current logic is very fragile. It claims
to be more reliable when the system is low on memory, but in fact, it
consumes two times more memory as at the moment of running this
function, there are two vports allocated with their queues and vectors.
Moreover, it claims to prevent the driver from running into ""bad state"",
but in fact, any error during the rebuild leaves the old vport in the
partially allocated state.
Finally, if the interface is down when the function is called, it always
allocates a new queue set, but when the user decides to enable the
interface later on, vport_open() allocates them once again, IOW there's
a clear memory leak here.

Just don't allocate a new queue set when performing a reset, that solves
crashes and memory leaks. Readd the old queue number and reopen the
interface on rollback - that solves limbo states when the device is left
disabled and/or without HW queues enabled."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

It turned out that pti_clone_pgtable() had alignment assumptions on

It can be reproduced with cammands:
cd /sys/fs/cgroup/
mkdir test
cd test/
echo +cpuset > ../cgroup.subtree_control
echo root > cpuset.cpus.partition
cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset.cpus.effective
0-3
echo 0-3 > cpuset.cpus // taking away all cpus from root

This issue is caused by the incorrect rebuilding of scheduling domains.
In this scenario, test/cpuset.cpus.partition should be an invalid root
and should not trigger the rebuilding of scheduling domains. When calling
update_parent_effective_cpumask with partcmd_update, if newmask is not
null, it should recheck newmask whether there are cpus is available

That commit increased max_segment_size to 64KB, with the justification
that the SCSI core was already using that size when PAGE_SIZE == 64KB,
and that there was existing logic to split over-sized requests.

However with a sufficiently large request, the splitting logic causes
each sg to be split into two commands in the DMA table, leading to
overflow of the DMA table, triggering the BUG_ON().

With default settings the bug doesn't trigger, because the request size
is limited by max_sectors_kb == 1280, however max_sectors_kb can be
increased, and apparently some distros do that by default using udev
rules.

Fix the bug for 4KB kernels by reverting to the old max_segment_size.

For 64KB kernels the sg_tablesize needs to be halved, to allow for the
possibility that each sg will be split into two."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

tcp: prevent concurrent execution of tcp_sk_exit_batch

Its possible that two threads call tcp_sk_exit_batch() concurrently,
once from the cleanup_net workqueue, once from a task that failed to clone
a new netns.  In the latter case, error unwinding calls the exit handlers
in reverse order for the 'failed' netns.

tcp_sk_exit_batch() calls tcp_twsk_purge().
Problem is that since commit b099ce2602d8 (""net: Batch inet_twsk_purge""),
this function picks up twsk in any dying netns, not just the one passed
in via exit_batch list.

This means that the error unwind of setup_net() can ""steal"" and destroy
timewait sockets belonging to the exiting netns.

This allows the netns exit worker to proceed to call

WARN_ON_ONCE(!refcount_dec_and_test(&net->ipv4.tcp_death_row.tw_refcount));

without the expected 1 -> 0 transition, which then splats.

At same time, error unwind path that is also running inet_twsk_purge()
will splat as well:

This doesn't seem like an actual bug (no tw sockets got lost and I don't
see a use-after-free) but as erroneous trigger of debug check.

  ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---

This happened because fscache_cookie_state_machine() was slow and was
still running while another process invoked fscache_unuse_cookie();
this led to a fscache_cookie_lru_do_one() call, setting the
FSCACHE_COOKIE_DO_LRU_DISCARD flag, which was picked up by
fscache_cookie_state_machine(), withdrawing the cookie via
cachefiles_withdraw_cookie(), clearing cookie->cache_priv.

At the same time, yet another process invoked
cachefiles_prepare_write(), which found a NULL pointer in this code
line:

  struct cachefiles_object *object = cachefiles_cres_object(cres);

The next line crashes, obviously:

  struct cachefiles_cache *cache = object->volume->cache;

During cachefiles_prepare_write(), the ""n_accesses"" counter is
non-zero (via fscache_begin_operation()).  The cookie must not be
withdrawn until it drops to zero.

The counter is checked by fscache_cookie_state_machine() before
switching to FSCACHE_COOKIE_STATE_RELINQUISHING and
FSCACHE_COOKIE_STATE_WITHDRAWING (in ""case
FSCACHE_COOKIE_STATE_FAILED""), but not for
FSCACHE_COOKIE_STATE_LRU_DISCARDING (""case
FSCACHE_COOKIE_STATE_ACTIVE"").

This patch adds the missing check.  With a non-zero access counter,
the function returns and the next fscache_end_cookie_access() call
will queue another fscache_cookie_state_machine() call to handle the
still-pending FSCACHE_COOKIE_DO_LRU_DISCARD."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

net: mana: Fix RX buf alloc_size alignment and atomic op panic

The MANA driver's RX buffer alloc_size is passed into napi_build_skb() to
create SKB. skb_shinfo(skb) is located at the end of skb, and its alignment
is affected by the alloc_size passed into napi_build_skb(). The size needs
to be aligned properly for better performance and atomic operations.
Otherwise, on ARM64 CPU, for certain MTU settings like 4000, atomic
operations may panic on the skb_shinfo(skb)->dataref due to alignment fault.

To fix this bug, add proper alignment to the alloc_size calculation.

The inode reclaiming process(See function prune_icache_sb) collects all
reclaimable inodes and mark them with I_FREEING flag at first, at that

(See function find_inode_fast), then the reclaiming process destroy the

KEYS: trusted: dcp: fix leak of blob encryption key

Trusted keys unseal the key blob on load, but keep the sealed payload in
the blob field so that every subsequent read (export) will simply
convert this field to hex and send it to userspace.

With DCP-based trusted keys, we decrypt the blob encryption key (BEK)
in the Kernel due hardware limitations and then decrypt the blob payload.
BEK decryption is done in-place which means that the trusted key blob
field is modified and it consequently holds the BEK in plain text.
Every subsequent read of that key thus send the plain text BEK instead
of the encrypted BEK to userspace.

This issue only occurs when importing a trusted DCP-based key and
then exporting it again. This should rarely happen as the common use cases
are to either create a new trusted key and export it, or import a key
blob and then just use it without exporting it again.

Fix this by performing BEK decryption and encryption in a dedicated
buffer. Further always wipe the plain text BEK buffer to prevent leaking
the key via uninitialized memory."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

KVM: s390: fix validity interception issue when gisa is switched off

We might run into a SIE validity if gisa has been disabled either via using
kernel parameter ""kvm.use_gisa=0"" or by setting the related sysfs
attribute to N (echo N >/sys/module/kvm/parameters/use_gisa).

The validity is caused by an invalid value in the SIE control block's
gisa designation. That happens because we pass the uninitialized gisa
origin to virt_to_phys() before writing it to the gisa designation.

To fix this we return 0 in kvm_s390_get_gisa_desc() if the origin is 0.
kvm_s390_get_gisa_desc() is used to determine which gisa designation to
set in the SIE control block. A value of 0 in the gisa designation disables
gisa usage.

The issue surfaces in the host kernel with the following kernel message as
soon a new kvm guest start is attemted.

xhci: Fix Panther point NULL pointer deref at full-speed re-enumeration

re-enumerating full-speed devices after a failed address device command
can trigger a NULL pointer dereference.

Full-speed devices may need to reconfigure the endpoint 0 Max Packet Size
value during enumeration. Usb core calls usb_ep0_reinit() in this case,
which ends up calling xhci_configure_endpoint().

On Panther point xHC the xhci_configure_endpoint() function will
additionally check and reserve bandwidth in software. Other hosts do
this in hardware

If xHC address device command fails then a new xhci_virt_device structure
is allocated as part of re-enabling the slot, but the bandwidth table
pointers are not set up properly here.
This triggers the NULL pointer dereference the next time usb_ep0_reinit()
is called and xhci_configure_endpoint() tries to check and reserve
bandwidth

CVE-2024-45399	2024-09-04T20:15:09.257	2024-09-24T16:48:10.083	Indico is an event management system that uses Flask-Multipass, a multi-backend authentication system for Flask. In Indico prior to version 3.3.4, corresponding to Flask-Multipass prior to version 0.5.5, there is a Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability during account creation when redirecting to the `next` URL. Exploitation requires initiating the account creation process with a maliciously crafted link, and then finalizing the signup process. Because of this, it can only target newly created (and thus unprivileged) Indico users. Indico 3.3.4 upgrades the dependency on Flask-Multipass to version 0.5.5, which fixes the issue. Those who build the Indico package themselves and cannot upgrade can update the `flask-multipass` dependency to `>=0.5.5` which fixes the vulnerability. Otherwise one could configure one's web server to disallow requests containing a query string with a `next` parameter that starts with `javascript:`.	4.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N		
CVE-2024-45395	2024-09-04T21:15:14.237	2024-09-24T16:50:07.930	"sigstore-go, a Go library for Sigstore signing and verification, is susceptible to a denial of service attack in versions prior to 0.6.1 when a verifier is provided a maliciously crafted Sigstore Bundle containing large amounts of verifiable data, in the form of signed transparency log entries, RFC 3161 timestamps, and attestation subjects. The verification of these data structures is computationally expensive. This can be used to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial of service attack. TUF's security model labels this type of vulnerability an ""Endless data attack,"" and can lead to verification failing to complete and disrupting services that rely on sigstore-go for verification. This vulnerability is addressed with sigstore-go 0.6.1, which adds hard limits to the number of verifiable data structures that can be processed in a bundle. Verification will fail if a bundle has data that exceeds these limits. The limits are 32 signed transparency log entries, 32 RFC 3161 timestamps, 1024 attestation subjects, and 32 digests per attestation subject. These limits are intended to be high enough to accommodate the vast majority of use cases, while preventing the verification of maliciously crafted bundles that contain large amounts of verifiable data. Users who are vulnerable but unable to quickly upgrade may consider adding manual bundle validation to enforce limits similar to those in the referenced patch prior to calling sigstore-go's verification functions."	3.1	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

CVE-2024-7884	2024-09-05T13:15:11.390	2024-09-12T20:47:13.387	"When a canister method is called via ic_cdk::call* , a new Future CallFuture is created  and can be awaited by the caller to get the execution result. Internally, the state of the Future is tracked and stored in a struct called CallFutureState.  A bug in the polling implementation of the CallFuture allows multiple references to be held for this internal state and not all references were dropped before the Future is resolved. Since we have unaccounted references held, a copy of the internal state ended up being persisted in the canister's heap and thus causing a memory leak. 
Impact Canisters built in Rust with ic_cdk and ic_cdk_timers are affected. If these canisters call a canister method, use timers or heartbeat, they will likely leak a small amount of memory on every such operation. In the worst case, this could lead to heap memory exhaustion triggered by an attacker. Motoko based canisters are not affected by the bug.
PatchesThe patch has been backported to all minor versions between >= 0.8.0, <= 0.15.0. The patched versions available are 0.8.2, 0.9.3, 0.10.1, 0.11.6, 0.12.2, 0.13.5, 0.14.1, 0.15.1 and their previous versions have been yanked. WorkaroundsThere are no known workarounds at the moment. Developers are recommended to upgrade their canister as soon as possible to the latest available patched version of ic_cdk to avoid running out of Wasm heap memory. 
Upgrading the canisters (without updating `ic_cdk`) also frees the leaked memory but it's only a temporary solution."	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-45157	2024-09-05T19:15:12.960	2025-03-14T17:15:47.320	An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS before 2.28.9 and 3.x before 3.6.1, in which the user-selected algorithm is not used. Unlike previously documented, enabling MBEDTLS_PSA_HMAC_DRBG_MD_TYPE does not cause the PSA subsystem to use HMAC_DRBG: it uses HMAC_DRBG only when MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_EXTERNAL_RNG and MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_C are disabled.	5.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

A stack buffer overflow in mbedtls_ecdsa_der_to_raw() and mbedtls_ecdsa_raw_to_der() can occur when the bits parameter is larger than the largest supported curve.

With TLS 1.3, when a server enables optional authentication of the client, if the client-provided certificate does not have appropriate values in if keyUsage or extKeyUsage extensions, then the return value of mbedtls_ssl_get_verify_result() would incorrectly have the MBEDTLS_X509_BADCERT_KEY_USAGE and MBEDTLS_X509_BADCERT_KEY_USAGE bits clear. As a result, an attacker that had a certificate valid for uses other than TLS client authentication would nonetheless be able to use it for TLS client authentication. Only TLS 1.3 servers were affected, and only with optional authentication (with required authentication, the handshake would be aborted with a fatal alert).	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2024-45039	2024-09-06T13:15:04.400	2024-09-20T00:12:48.847	gnark is a fast zk-SNARK library that offers a high-level API to design circuits. Versions prior to 0.11.0 have a soundness issue - in case of multiple commitments used inside the circuit the prover is able to choose all but the last commitment. As gnark uses the commitments for optimized non-native multiplication, lookup checks etc. as random challenges, then it could impact the soundness of the whole circuit. However, using multiple commitments has been discouraged due to the additional cost to the verifier and it has not been supported in the recursive in-circuit Groth16 verifier and Solidity verifier. gnark's maintainers expect the impact of the issue be very small - only for the users who have implemented the native Groth16 verifier or are using it with multiple commitments. We do not have information of such users. The issue has been patched in version 0.11.0. As a workaround, users should follow gnark maintainers' recommendation to use only a single commitment and then derive in-circuit commitments as needed using the `std/multicommit` package.	6.2	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2024-45040	2024-09-06T13:15:04.893	2024-09-20T00:13:23.323	gnark is a fast zk-SNARK library that offers a high-level API to design circuits. Prior to version 0.11.0, commitments to private witnesses in Groth16 as implemented break the zero-knowledge property. The vulnerability affects only Groth16 proofs with commitments. Notably, PLONK proofs are not affected. The vulnerability affects the zero-knowledge property of the proofs - in case the witness (secret or internal) values are small, then the attacker may be able to enumerate all possible choices to deduce the actual value. If the possible choices for the variables to be committed is large or there are many values committed, then it would be computationally infeasible to enumerate all valid choices. It doesn't affect the completeness/soundness of the proofs. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 0.11.0. The patch to fix the issue is to add additional randomized value to the list of committed value at proving time to mask the rest of the values which were committed. As a workaround, the user can manually commit to a randomized value.	5.9	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVE-2024-45405	2024-09-06T13:15:05.830	2024-09-06T16:46:26.830	"`gix-path` is a crate of the `gitoxide` project (an implementation of `git` written in Rust) dealing paths and their conversions. Prior to version 0.10.11, `gix-path` runs `git` to find the path of a configuration file associated with the `git` installation, but improperly resolves paths containing unusual or non-ASCII characters, in rare cases enabling a local attacker to inject configuration leading to code execution. Version 0.10.11 contains a patch for the issue.

In `gix_path::env`, the underlying implementation of the `installation_config` and `installation_config_prefix` functions calls `git config -l --show-origin` to find the path of a file to treat as belonging to the `git` installation. Affected versions of `gix-path` do not pass `-z`/`--null` to cause `git` to report literal paths. Instead, to cover the occasional case that `git` outputs a quoted path, they attempt to parse the path by stripping the quotation marks. The problem is that, when a path is quoted, it may change in substantial ways beyond the concatenation of quotation marks. If not reversed, these changes can result in another valid path that is not equivalent to the original.

On a single-user system, it is not possible to exploit this, unless `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM` and `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` have been set to unusual values or Git has been installed in an unusual way. Such a scenario is not expected. Exploitation is unlikely even on a multi-user system, though it is plausible in some uncommon configurations or use cases. In general, exploitation is more likely to succeed if users are expected to install `git` themselves, and are likely to do so in predictable locations; locations where `git` is installed, whether due to usernames in their paths or otherwise, contain characters that `git` quotes by default in paths, such as non-English letters and accented letters; a custom `system`-scope configuration file is specified with the `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM` environment variable, and its path is in an unusual location or has strangely named components; or a `system`-scope configuration file is absent, empty, or suppressed by means other than `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM`. Currently, `gix-path` can treat a `global`-scope configuration file as belonging to the installation if no higher scope configuration file is available. This increases the likelihood of exploitation even on a system where `git` is installed system-wide in an ordinary way. However, exploitation is expected to be very difficult even under any combination of those factors."	6.0	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

The message-parser normally reads reasonably sized chunks of the message. However, when it feeds them to message-header-parser, it starts building up ""full_value"" buffer out of the smaller chunks. The full_value buffer has no size limit, so large headers can cause large memory usage. It doesn't matter whether it's a single long header line, or a single header split into multiple lines. This bug exists in all Dovecot versions. Incoming mails typically have some size limits set by MTA, so even largest possible header size may still fit into Dovecot's vsz_limit. So attackers probably can't DoS a victim user this way. A user could APPEND larger mails though, allowing them to DoS themselves (although maybe cause some memory issues for the backend in general). One can implement restrictions on headers on MTA component preceding Dovecot. No publicly available exploits are known."	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Clients that experience a MITM attack during the pairing process may inadvertantly allow access to an unintended client rather than failing authentication due to a PIN validation error. The pairing attempt fails due to the incorrect PIN, but the certificate from the forged pairing attempt is incorrectly persisted prior to the completion of the pairing request. This allows access to the certificate belonging to the attacker.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2024-45412	2024-09-10T16:15:20.850	2024-11-21T09:37:44.827	Yeti bridges the gap between CTI and DFIR practitioners by providing a Forensics Intelligence platform and pipeline. Remote user-controlled data tags can reach a Unicode normalization with a compatibility form NFKD. Under Windows, such normalization is costly in resources and may lead to denial of service with attacks such as One Million Unicode payload. This can get worse with the use of special Unicode characters like U+2100 (℀), or U+2105 (℅) which could lead the payload size to be tripled. Versions prior to 2.1.11 are affected by this vulnerability. The patch is included in 2.1.11.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

CVE-2024-45591	2024-09-10T16:15:21.340	2024-09-20T19:55:54.657	XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. The REST API exposes the history of any page in XWiki of which the attacker knows the name. The exposed information includes for each modification of the page the time of the modification, the version number, the author of the modification (both username and displayed name) and the version comment. This information is exposed regardless of the rights setup, and even when the wiki is configured to be fully private. On a private wiki, this can be tested by accessing /xwiki/rest/wikis/xwiki/spaces/Main/pages/WebHome/history, if this shows the history of the main page then the installation is vulnerable. This has been patched in XWiki 15.10.9 and XWiki 16.3.0RC1.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

Removing a 'subflow' endpoint will first trigger a RM_ADDR, then the
subflow closure. Before this patch, and upon the reception of the
RM_ADDR, the other peer will then try to decrement this
add_addr_accepted. That's not correct because the attached subflows have
not been created upon the reception of an ADD_ADDR.

A way to solve that is to decrement the counter only if the attached
subflow was an MP_JOIN to a remote id that was not 0, and initiated by
the host receiving the RM_ADDR."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Now, the counter is decremented, only if the ID is being used outside

char: xillybus: Check USB endpoints when probing device

Ensure, as the driver probes the device, that all endpoints that the
driver may attempt to access exist and are of the correct type.

All XillyUSB devices must have a Bulk IN and Bulk OUT endpoint at
address 1. This is verified in xillyusb_setup_base_eps().

On top of that, a XillyUSB device may have additional Bulk OUT
endpoints. The information about these endpoints' addresses is deduced
from a data structure (the IDT) that the driver fetches from the device
while probing it. These endpoints are checked in setup_channels().

A XillyUSB device never has more than one IN endpoint, as all data

drm/msm/dpu: move dpu_encoder's connector assignment to atomic_enable()

For cases where the crtc's connectors_changed was set without enable/active
getting toggled , there is an atomic_enable() call followed by an
atomic_disable() but without an atomic_mode_set().

This results in a NULL ptr access for the dpu_encoder_get_drm_fmt() call in
the atomic_enable() as the dpu_encoder's connector was cleared in the
atomic_disable() but not re-assigned as there was no atomic_mode_set() call.

Fix the NULL ptr access by moving the assignment for atomic_enable() and also
use drm_atomic_get_new_connector_for_encoder() to get the connector from
the atomic_state.

netem: fix return value if duplicate enqueue fails

There is a bug in netem_enqueue() introduced by
commit 5845f706388a (""net: netem: fix skb length BUG_ON in __skb_to_sgvec"")
that can lead to a use-after-free.

This commit made netem_enqueue() always return NET_XMIT_SUCCESS
when a packet is duplicated, which can cause the parent qdisc's q.qlen
to be mistakenly incremented. When this happens qlen_notify() may be
skipped on the parent during destruction, leaving a dangling pointer
for some classful qdiscs like DRR.

There are two ways for the bug happen:

- If the duplicated packet is dropped by rootq->enqueue() and then
  the original packet is also dropped.
- If rootq->enqueue() sends the duplicated packet to a different qdisc
  and the original packet is dropped.

In both cases NET_XMIT_SUCCESS is returned even though no packets
are enqueued at the netem qdisc.

The fix is to defer the enqueue of the duplicate packet until after

bpf: Fix a kernel verifier crash in stacksafe()

Daniel Hodges reported a kernel verifier crash when playing with sched-ext.

mm/vmalloc: fix page mapping if vm_area_alloc_pages() with high order fallback to order 0

The __vmap_pages_range_noflush() assumes its argument pages** contains
pages with the same page shift.  However, since commit e9c3cda4d86e (""mm,
vmalloc: fix high order __GFP_NOFAIL allocations""), if gfp_flags includes
__GFP_NOFAIL with high order in vm_area_alloc_pages() and page allocation
failed for high order, the pages** may contain two different page shifts
(high order and order-0).  This could lead __vmap_pages_range_noflush() to
perform incorrect mappings, potentially resulting in memory corruption.

Users might encounter this as follows (vmap_allow_huge = true, 2M is for
PMD_SIZE):

kvmalloc(2M, __GFP_NOFAIL|GFP_X)

We can remove the fallback code because if a high-order allocation fails,

mm/hugetlb: fix hugetlb vs. core-mm PT locking

We recently made GUP's common page table walking code to also walk hugetlb
VMAs without most hugetlb special-casing, preparing for the future of
having less hugetlb-specific page table walking code in the codebase. 
Turns out that we missed one page table locking detail: page table locking
for hugetlb folios that are not mapped using a single PMD/PUD.

Assume we have hugetlb folio that spans multiple PTEs (e.g., 64 KiB
hugetlb folios on arm64 with 4 KiB base page size).  GUP, as it walks the
page tables, will perform a pte_offset_map_lock() to grab the PTE table
lock.

However, hugetlb that concurrently modifies these page tables would
actually grab the mm->page_table_lock: with USE_SPLIT_PTE_PTLOCKS, the
locks would differ.  Something similar can happen right now with hugetlb
folios that span multiple PMDs when USE_SPLIT_PMD_PTLOCKS.

This issue can be reproduced [1], for example triggering:

Let's make huge_pte_lockptr() effectively use the same PT locks as any
core-mm page table walker would.  Add ptep_lockptr() to obtain the PTE
page table lock using a pte pointer -- unfortunately we cannot convert
pte_lockptr() because virt_to_page() doesn't work with kmap'ed page tables
we can have with CONFIG_HIGHPTE.

Handle CONFIG_PGTABLE_LEVELS correctly by checking in reverse order, such
that when e.g., CONFIG_PGTABLE_LEVELS==2 with
PGDIR_SIZE==P4D_SIZE==PUD_SIZE==PMD_SIZE will work as expected.  Document
why that works.

There is one ugly case: powerpc 8xx, whereby we have an 8 MiB hugetlb
folio being mapped using two PTE page tables.  While hugetlb wants to take
the PMD table lock, core-mm would grab the PTE table lock of one of both
PTE page tables.  In such corner cases, we have to make sure that both
locks match, which is (fortunately!) currently guaranteed for 8xx as it
does not support SMP and consequently doesn't use split PT locks.

fix bitmap corruption on close_range() with CLOSE_RANGE_UNSHARE

copy_fd_bitmaps(new, old, count) is expected to copy the first
count/BITS_PER_LONG bits from old->full_fds_bits[] and fill
the rest with zeroes.  What it does is copying enough words
(BITS_TO_LONGS(count/BITS_PER_LONG)), then memsets the rest.
That works fine, *if* all bits past the cutoff point are
clear.  Otherwise we are risking garbage from the last word
we'd copied.

For most of the callers that is true - expand_fdtable() has
count equal to old->max_fds, so there's no open descriptors
past count, let alone fully occupied words in ->open_fds[],
which is what bits in ->full_fds_bits[] correspond to.

The other caller (dup_fd()) passes sane_fdtable_size(old_fdt, max_fds),
which is the smallest multiple of BITS_PER_LONG that covers all
opened descriptors below max_fds.  In the common case (copying on
fork()) max_fds is ~0U, so all opened descriptors will be below
it and we are fine, by the same reasons why the call in expand_fdtable()
is safe.

Unfortunately, there is a case where max_fds is less than that
and where we might, indeed, end up with junk in ->full_fds_bits[] -
close_range(from, to, CLOSE_RANGE_UNSHARE) with
	* descriptor table being currently shared
	* 'to' being above the current capacity of descriptor table
	* 'from' being just under some chunk of opened descriptors.
In that case we end up with observably wrong behaviour - e.g. spawn
a child with CLONE_FILES, get all descriptors in range 0..127 open,
then close_range(64, ~0U, CLOSE_RANGE_UNSHARE) and watch dup(0) ending
up with descriptor #128, despite #64 being observably not open.

The minimally invasive fix would be to deal with that in dup_fd().
If this proves to add measurable overhead, we can go that way, but
let's try to fix copy_fd_bitmaps() first.

* new helper: bitmap_copy_and_expand(to, from, bits_to_copy, size).
* make copy_fd_bitmaps() take the bitmap size in words, rather than
bits; it's 'count' argument is always a multiple of BITS_PER_LONG,
so we are not losing any information, and that way we can use the
same helper for all three bitmaps - compiler will see that count
is a multiple of BITS_PER_LONG for the large ones, so it'll generate
plain memcpy()+memset().

Since we only checked the addrs_list field, an attacker can send a group type message with an invalid addrs_num field, which will cause the message handled by the firmware to be much larger than the current buffer, thus causing a memory corruption issue that goes beyond the payload length.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L

usb: dwc3: core: Prevent USB core invalid event buffer address access

This commit addresses an issue where the USB core could access an
invalid event buffer address during runtime suspend, potentially causing
SMMU faults and other memory issues in Exynos platforms. The problem
arises from the following sequence.
        1. In dwc3_gadget_suspend, there is a chance of a timeout when
        moving the USB core to the halt state after clearing the
        run/stop bit by software.
        2. In dwc3_core_exit, the event buffer is cleared regardless of
        the USB core's status, which may lead to an SMMU faults and
        other memory issues. if the USB core tries to access the event
        buffer address.

To prevent this hardware quirk on Exynos platforms, this commit ensures
that the event buffer address is not cleared by software  when the USB
core is active during runtime suspend by checking its status before
clearing the buffer address."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

But then after pn533_poll_create_mod_list() call in pn533_start_poll()

drm/xe: prevent UAF around preempt fence

The fence lock is part of the queue, therefore in the current design
anything locking the fence should then also hold a ref to the queue to
prevent the queue from being freed.

However, currently it looks like we signal the fence and then drop the
queue ref, but if something is waiting on the fence, the waiter is
kicked to wake up at some later point, where upon waking up it first
grabs the lock before checking the fence state. But if we have already
dropped the queue ref, then the lock might already be freed as part of
the queue, leading to uaf.

To prevent this, move the fence lock into the fence itself so we don't
run into lifetime issues. Alternative might be to have device level
lock, or only release the queue in the fence release callback, however
that might require pushing to another worker to avoid locking issues.

[CAUSE]
Although I cannot reproduce the error, the report itself is good enough
to pin down the cause.

The call trace is the regular endio workqueue context, but the
free-by-task trace is showing that during btrfs_submit_chunk() we
already hit a critical error, and is calling btrfs_bio_end_io() to error
out.  And the original endio function called bio_put() to free the whole
bio.

This means a double freeing thus causing use-after-free, e.g.:

1. Enter btrfs_submit_bio() with a read bio
   The read bio length is 128K, crossing two 64K stripes.

2. The first run of btrfs_submit_chunk()

2.1 Call btrfs_map_block(), which returns 64K
2.2 Call btrfs_split_bio()
    Now there are two bios, one referring to the first 64K, the other
    referring to the second 64K.
2.3 The first half is submitted.

3. The second run of btrfs_submit_chunk()

3.1 Call btrfs_map_block(), which by somehow failed
    Now we call btrfs_bio_end_io() to handle the error

3.2 btrfs_bio_end_io() calls the original endio function
    Which is end_bbio_data_read(), and it calls bio_put() for the
    original bio.

    Now the original bio is freed.

4. The submitted first 64K bio finished
   Now we call into btrfs_check_read_bio() and tries to advance the bio
   iter.
   But since the original bio (thus its iter) is already freed, we
   trigger the above use-after free.

   And even if the memory is not poisoned/corrupted, we will later call
   the original endio function, causing a double freeing.

[FIX]
Instead of calling btrfs_bio_end_io(), call btrfs_orig_bbio_end_io(),
which has the extra check on split bios and do the pr

Xen or KVM), which does not know anything about those specific mappings.

selinux,smack: don't bypass permissions check in inode_setsecctx hook

Marek Gresko reports that the root user on an NFS client is able to
change the security labels on files on an NFS filesystem that is
exported with root squashing enabled.

The end of the kerneldoc comment for __vfs_setxattr_noperm() states:

 *  This function requires the caller to lock the inode's i_mutex before it
 *  is executed. It also assumes that the caller will make the appropriate
 *  permission checks.

nfsd_setattr() does do permissions checking via fh_verify() and
nfsd_permission(), but those don't do all the same permissions checks
that are done by security_inode_setxattr() and its related LSM hooks do.

Since nfsd_setattr() is the only consumer of security_inode_setsecctx(),
simplest solution appears to be to replace the call to
__vfs_setxattr_noperm() with a call to __vfs_setxattr_locked().  This
fixes the above issue and has the added benefit of causing nfsd to

libfs: fix infinite directory reads for offset dir

After we switch tmpfs dir operations from simple_dir_operations to
simple_offset_dir_operations, every rename happened will fill new dentry
to dest dir's maple tree(&SHMEM_I(inode)->dir_offsets->mt) with a free
key starting with octx->newx_offset, and then set newx_offset equals to
free key + 1. This will lead to infinite readdir combine with rename
happened at the same time, which fail generic/736 in xfstests(detail show
as below).

1. create 5000 files(1 2 3...) under one dir
2. call readdir(man 3 readdir) once, and get one entry
3. rename(entry, ""TEMPFILE""), then rename(""TEMPFILE"", entry)

We choose the same logic what commit 9b378f6ad48cf (""btrfs: fix infinite

do not emit the entry which index >= last_index. The file->private_data

hot-removed from the PCIe side as a result of NVM firmware authentication,

them down. This is due to fact that the Thunderbolt networking driver
also tries to cleanup the paths and ends up blocking in

However, at this point we already cleaned the paths in tb_stop() so

tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: mark last busy before uart_add_one_port

With ""earlycon initcall_debug=1 loglevel=8"" in bootargs, kernel
sometimes boot hang. It is because normal console still is not ready,
but runtime suspend is called, so early console putchar will hang
in waiting TRDE set in UARTSTAT.

The lpuart driver has auto suspend delay set to 3000ms, but during
uart_add_one_port, a child device serial ctrl will added and probed with
its pm runtime enabled(see serial_ctrl.c).
The runtime suspend call path is:

However, there's an observed anomaly in the H2-DM1E PLC's protocol execution, namely its acceptance of multiple distinct packets as valid authentication responses. This behavior deviates from standard security practices where a single, specific response or encoding pattern is expected for successful authentication.	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2024-6087	2024-09-13T17:15:13.027	2024-09-19T19:32:14.710	An improper access control vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the 'invite user' functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated endpoints to CSRF attacks.	8.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2024-6867	2024-09-13T17:15:13.613	2024-09-19T18:28:05.477	An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

A vulnerability has been identified in the authentication and authorization process of the endpoint responsible for altering the metadata of an emergency access. It permits an attacker with granted emergency access to escalate their privileges by changing the access level and modifying the wait time. Consequently, the attacker can gain full control over the vault (when only intended to have read access) while bypassing the necessary wait period.	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2024-39925	2024-09-13T18:15:03.927	2025-07-10T13:23:03.340	An issue was discovered in Vaultwarden (formerly Bitwarden_RS) 1.30.3. It lacks an offboarding process for members who leave an organization. As a result, the shared organization key is not rotated when a member departs. Consequently, the departing member, whose access should be revoked, retains a copy of the organization key. Additionally, the application fails to adequately protect some encrypted data stored on the server. Consequently, an authenticated user could gain unauthorized access to encrypted data of any organization, even if the user is not a member of the targeted organization. However, the user would need to know the corresponding organizationId. Hence, if a user (whose access to an organization has been revoked) already possesses the organization key, that user could use the key to decrypt the leaked data.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2024-39926	2024-09-13T18:15:04.013	2025-07-10T13:22:41.693	An issue was discovered in Vaultwarden (formerly Bitwarden_RS) 1.30.3. A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) or, due to the default CSP, HTML injection vulnerability has been discovered in the admin dashboard. This potentially allows an authenticated attacker to inject malicious code into the dashboard, which is then executed or rendered in the context of an administrator's browser when viewing the injected content. However, it is important to note that the default Content Security Policy (CSP) of the application blocks most exploitation paths, significantly mitigating the potential impact.	5.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

CVE-2024-45800	2024-09-16T20:15:47.097	2024-09-20T12:31:20.110	"Snappymail is an open source web-based email client. SnappyMail uses the `cleanHtml()` function to cleanup HTML and CSS in emails. Research discovered that the function has a few bugs which cause an mXSS exploit. Because the function allowed too many (invalid) HTML elements, it was possible (with incorrect markup) to trick the browser to ""fix"" the broken markup into valid markup. As a result a motivated attacker may be able to inject javascript. However, due to the default Content Security Policy the impact of the exploit is minimal. It could be possible to create an attack which leaks some data when loading images through the proxy.
This way it might be possible to use the proxy to attack the local system, like with `http://localhost:5000/leak`. Another attack could be to load a JavaScript attachment of the email. This is very tricky as the email must link to every possible UID as each email has a unique UID which has a value between 1 and 18446744073709551615 **v2.38.0** and up now remove unsupported HTML elements which mitigates the issue. Users are advised to upgrade. Older versions can install an extension named ""Security mXSS"" as a mitigation. This will be available at the administration area at `/?admin#/packages`. **NOTE:** this extension can not ""fix"" malicious code in encrypted messages or (html) attachments as it can't manipulate the JavaScript code for this.

CVE-2024-45803	2024-09-17T19:15:28.660	2024-10-07T17:05:16.440	Wire UI is a library of components and resources to empower Laravel and Livewire application development. A potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the `/wireui/button` endpoint, specifically through the `label` query parameter. Malicious actors could exploit this vulnerability by injecting JavaScript into the `label` parameter, leading to the execution of arbitrary code in the victim's browser. The `/wireui/button` endpoint dynamically renders button labels based on user-provided input via the `label` query parameter. Due to insufficient sanitization or escaping of this input, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript. By crafting such a request, an attacker can inject arbitrary code that will be executed by the browser when the endpoint is accessed. If exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the affected website. This could lead to: **Session Hijacking**: Stealing session cookies, tokens, or other sensitive information. **User Impersonation**: Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users. **Phishing**: Redirecting users to malicious websites. **Content Manipulation**: Altering the appearance or behavior of the affected page to mislead users or execute further attacks. The severity of this vulnerability depends on the context of where the affected component is used, but in all cases, it poses a significant risk to user security. This issue has been addressed in release versions 1.19.3 and 2.1.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	6.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

CVE-2024-45812	2024-09-17T20:15:06.037	2024-09-20T12:30:51.220	Vite a frontend build tooling framework for javascript. Affected versions of vite were discovered to contain a DOM Clobbering vulnerability when building scripts to `cjs`/`iife`/`umd` output format. The DOM Clobbering gadget in the module can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an img tag with an unsanitized name attribute) are present. DOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces of js code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into executable code. We have identified a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Vite bundled scripts, particularly when the scripts dynamically import other scripts from the assets folder and the developer sets the build output format to `cjs`, `iife`, or `umd`. In such cases, Vite replaces relative paths starting with `__VITE_ASSET__` using the URL retrieved from `document.currentScript`. However, this implementation is vulnerable to a DOM Clobbering attack. The `document.currentScript` lookup can be shadowed by an attacker via the browser's named DOM tree element access mechanism. This manipulation allows an attacker to replace the intended script element with a malicious HTML element. When this happens, the src attribute of the attacker-controlled element is used as the URL for importing scripts, potentially leading to the dynamic loading of scripts from an attacker-controlled server. This vulnerability can result in cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on websites that include Vite-bundled files (configured with an output format of `cjs`, `iife`, or `umd`) and allow users to inject certain scriptless HTML tags without properly sanitizing the name or id attributes. This issue has been patched in versions 5.4.6, 5.3.6, 5.2.14, 4.5.5, and 3.2.11. Users are advised to upgrade.

CVE-2024-46982	2024-09-17T22:15:02.273	2025-09-10T15:46:05.173	Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. By sending a crafted HTTP request, it is possible to poison the cache of a non-dynamic server-side rendered route in the pages router (this does not affect the app router). When this crafted request is sent it could coerce Next.js to cache a route that is meant to not be cached and send a `Cache-Control: s-maxage=1, stale-while-revalidate` header which some upstream CDNs may cache as well. To be potentially affected all of the following must apply: 1. Next.js between 13.5.1 and 14.2.9, 2. Using pages router, & 3. Using non-dynamic server-side rendered routes e.g. `pages/dashboard.tsx` not `pages/blog/[slug].tsx`. This vulnerability was resolved in Next.js v13.5.7, v14.2.10, and later. We recommend upgrading regardless of whether you can reproduce the issue or not. There are no official or recommended workarounds for this issue, we recommend that users patch to a safe version.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

btrfs: fix qgroup reserve leaks in cow_file_range

In the buffered write path, the dirty page owns the qgroup reserve until
it creates an ordered_extent.

Therefore, any errors that occur before the ordered_extent is created
must free that reservation, or else the space is leaked. The fstest
generic/475 exercises various IO error paths, and is able to trigger
errors in cow_file_range where we fail to get to allocating the ordered
extent. Note that because we *do* clear delalloc, we are likely to
remove the inode from the delalloc list, so the inodes/pages to not have
invalidate/launder called on them in the commit abort path.

This results in failures at the unmount stage of the test that look like:

  BTRFS: error (device dm-8 state EA) in cleanup_transaction:2018: errno=-5 IO failure
  BTRFS: error (device dm-8 state EA) in btrfs_replace_file_extents:2416: errno=-5 IO failure

btrfs: fix race between direct IO write and fsync when using same fd

If we have 2 threads that are using the same file descriptor and one of
them is doing direct IO writes while the other is doing fsync, we have a
race where we can end up either:

1) Attempt a fsync without holding the inode's lock, triggering an
   assertion failures when assertions are enabled;

2) Do an invalid memory access from the fsync task because the file private
   points to memory allocated on stack by the direct IO task and it may be
   used by the fsync task after the stack was destroyed.

The race happens like this:

1) A user space program opens a file descriptor with O_DIRECT;

2) The program spawns 2 threads using libpthread for example;

3) One of the threads uses the file descriptor to do direct IO writes,
   while the other calls fsync using the same file descriptor.

4) Call task A the thread doing direct IO writes and task B the thread
   doing fsyncs;

5) Task A does a direct IO write, and at btrfs_direct_write() sets the
   file's private to an on stack allocated private with the member
   'fsync_skip_inode_lock' set to true;

6) Task B enters btrfs_sync_file() and sees that there's a private
   structure associated to the file which has 'fsync_skip_inode_lock' set
   to true, so it skips locking the inode's VFS lock;

7) Task A completes the direct IO write, and resets the file's private to
   NULL since it had no prior private and our private was stack allocated.
   Then it unlocks the inode's VFS lock;

8) Task B enters btrfs_get_ordered_extents_for_logging(), then the
   assertion that checks the inode's VFS lock is held fails, since task B
   never locked it and task A has already unlocked it.

The stack trace produced is the following:

   assertion failed: inode_is_locked(&inode->vfs_inode), in fs/btrfs/ordered-data.c:983

VMCI: Fix use-after-free when removing resource in vmci_resource_remove()

When removing a resource from vmci_resource_table in
vmci_resource_remove(), the search is performed using the resource
handle by comparing context and resource fields.

It is possible though to create two resources with different types
but same handle (same context and resource fields).

When trying to remove one of the resources, vmci_resource_remove()
may not remove the intended one, but the object will still be freed
as in the case of the datagram type in vmci_datagram_destroy_handle().
vmci_resource_table will still hold a pointer to this freed resource
leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.

binder: fix UAF caused by offsets overwrite

Binder objects are processed and copied individually into the target
buffer during transactions. Any raw data in-between these objects is
copied as well. However, this raw data copy lacks an out-of-bounds
check. If the raw data exceeds the data section size then the copy
overwrites the offsets section. This eventually triggers an error that
attempts to unwind the processed objects. However, at this point the
offsets used to index these objects are now corrupted.

Unwinding with corrupted offsets can result in decrements of arbitrary
nodes and lead to their premature release. Other users of such nodes are
left with a dangling pointer triggering a use-after-free. This issue is
made evident by the following KASAN report (trimmed):

Squashfs: sanity check symbolic link size

Syzkiller reports a ""KMSAN: uninit-value in pick_link"" bug.

This is caused by an uninitialised page, which is ultimately caused
by a corrupted symbolic link size read from disk.

The reason why the corrupted symlink size causes an uninitialised
page is due to the following sequence of events:

1. squashfs_read_inode() is called to read the symbolic
   link from disk.  This assigns the corrupted value
   3875536935 to inode->i_size.

2. Later squashfs_symlink_read_folio() is called, which assigns
   this corrupted value to the length variable, which being a
   signed int, overflows producing a negative number.

3. The following loop that fills in the page contents checks that
   the copied bytes is less than length, which being negative means
   the loop is skipped, producing an uninitialised page.

This patch adds a sanity check which checks that the symbolic

CVE-2024-46745	2024-09-18T08:15:03.667	2025-09-26T18:11:13.270	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Input: uinput - reject requests with unreasonable number of slots


When exercising uinput interface syzkaller may try setting up device
with a really large number of slots, which causes memory allocation
failure in input_mt_init_slots(). While this allocation failure is
handled properly and request is rejected, it results in syzkaller
reports. Additionally, such request may put undue burden on the
system which will try to free a lot of memory for a bogus request.

Fix it by limiting allowed number of slots to 100. This can easily
be extended if we see devices that can track more than 100 contacts."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

HID: amd_sfh: free driver_data after destroying hid device

HID driver callbacks aren't called anymore once hid_destroy_device() has
been called. Hence, hid driver_data should be freed only after the
hid_destroy_device() function returned as driver_data is used in several
callbacks.

I observed a crash with kernel 6.10.0 on my T14s Gen 3, after enabling
KASAN to debug memory allocation, I got this output:

Ironically pci_bus_reset(), several calls down from pci_reset_bus(), uses
pci_bus_lock() before issuing the reset which locks everything *but* the

mwifiex_get_priv_by_id() returns the priv pointer corresponding to
the bss_num and bss_type, but without checking if the priv is actually
currently in use.
Unused priv pointers do not have a wiphy attached to them which can
lead to NULL pointer dereferences further down the callstack.  Fix
this by returning only used priv pointers which have priv->bss_mode
set to something else than NL80211_IFTYPE_UNSPECIFIED.

Said NULL pointer dereference happened when an Accesspoint was started

Right now it's possible to hit NULL pointer dereference in
rtw_rx_fill_rx_status on hw object and/or its fields because
initialization routine can start getting USB replies before
rtw_dev is fully setup.

The stack trace looks like this:

rtw_rx_fill_rx_status
rtw8821c_query_rx_desc
rtw_usb_rx_handler

queue_work
rtw_usb_read_port_complete
...
usb_submit_urb

rtw_usb_init_rx
rtw_usb_probe

rtw_register_hw, which does all kinds of initialization (e.g.
via ieee80211_register_hw) that rtw_rx_fill_rx_status relies on.

Fix this by moving the first usb_submit_urb after everything
is set up.

The crash occurs because although the MSI data structure has been

fou: Fix null-ptr-deref in GRO.

We observed a null-ptr-deref in fou_gro_receive() while shutting down

The NULL pointer is sk->sk_user_data, and the offset 8 is of protocol
in struct fou.

When fou_release() is called due to netns dismantle or explicit tunnel
teardown, udp_tunnel_sock_release() sets NULL to sk->sk_user_data.
Then, the tunnel socket is destroyed after a single RCU grace period.

So, in-flight udp4_gro_receive() could find the socket and execute the
FOU GRO handler, where sk->sk_user_data could be NULL.

Let's use rcu_dereference_sk_user_data() in fou_from_sock() and add NULL
checks in FOU GRO handlers.

The previous way of handling this through returning -EBUSY is not viable,
particularly when destroying AF_XDP socket, because the kernel proceeds
with removal anyway.

There is plenty of code between those calls and there is no need to create
a large critical section that covers all of them, same as there is no need
to protect ice_vsi_rebuild() with rtnl_lock().

Add xdp_state_lock mutex to protect ice_vsi_rebuild() and ice_xdp().

Leaving unprotected sections in between would result in two states that
have to be considered:
1. when the VSI is closed, but not yet rebuild
2. when VSI is already rebuild, but not yet open

The latter case is actually already handled through !netif_running() case,
we just need to adjust flag checking a little. The former one is not as
trivial, because between ice_vsi_close() and ice_vsi_rebuild(), a lot of
hardware interaction happens, this can make adding/deleting rings exit
with an error. Luckily, VSI rebuild is pending and can apply new
configuration for us in a managed fashion.

Therefore, add an additional VSI state flag ICE_VSI_REBUILD_PENDING to
indicate that ice_x

Currently, netif_queue_set_napi() is called from ice_vsi_rebuild() that is

the rtnl_lock just for a single function and complicates the
synchronization with .ndo_bpf. At the same time, there no actual need to

Fill napi-to-queue information when opening the VSI and clear it when the

XDP queues, as this leads to out-of-bounds writes, such as one below.

can: bcm: Remove proc entry when dev is unregistered.

syzkaller reported a warning in bcm_connect() below. [0]

The repro calls connect() to vxcan1, removes vxcan1, and calls
connect() with ifindex == 0.

Calling connect() for a BCM socket allocates a proc entry.
Then, bcm_sk(sk)->bound is set to 1 to prevent further connect().

However, removing the bound device resets bcm_sk(sk)->bound to 0
in bcm_notify().

The 2nd connect() tries to allocate a proc entry with the same
name and sets NULL to bcm_sk(sk)->bcm_proc_read, leaking the
original proc entry.

Since the proc entry is available only for connect()ed sockets,
let's clean up the entry when the bound netdev is unregistered.

CVE-2024-46783	2024-09-18T08:15:05.630	2024-11-20T15:47:35.273	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp_bpf: fix return value of tcp_bpf_sendmsg()

When we cork messages in psock->cork, the last message triggers the
flushing will result in sending a sk_msg larger than the current
message size. In this case, in tcp_bpf_send_verdict(), 'copied' becomes
negative at least in the following case:

468         case __SK_DROP:
469         default:
470                 sk_msg_free_partial(sk, msg, tosend);
471                 sk_msg_apply_bytes(psock, tosend);
472                 *copied -= (tosend + delta); // <==== HERE
473                 return -EACCES;

Therefore, it could lead to the following BUG with a proper value of
'copied' (thanks to syzbot). We should not use negative 'copied' as a
return value here.

userfaultfd: fix checks for huge PMDs

Patch series ""userfaultfd: fix races around pmd_trans_huge() check"", v2.

The pmd_trans_huge() code in mfill_atomic() is wrong in three different
ways depending on kernel version:

1. The pmd_trans_huge() check is racy and can lead to a BUG_ON() (if you hit
   the right two race windows) - I've tested this in a kernel build with
   some extra mdelay() calls. See the commit message for a description
   of the race scenario.
   On older kernels (before 6.5), I think the same bug can even
   theoretically lead to accessing transhuge page contents as a page table
   if you hit the right 5 narrow race windows (I haven't tested this case).
2. As pointed out by Qi Zheng, pmd_trans_huge() is not sufficient for
   detecting PMDs that don't point to page tables.
   On older kernels (before 6.5), you'd just have to win a single fairly
   wide race to hit this.
   I've tested this on 6.1 stable by racing migration (with a mdelay()
   patched into try_to_migrate()) against UFFDIO_ZEROPAGE - on my x86
   VM, that causes a kernel oops in ptlock_ptr().
3. On newer kernels (>=6.5), for shmem mappings, khugepaged is allowed
   to yank page tables out from under us (though I haven't tested that),
   so I think the BUG_ON() checks in mfill_atomic() are just wrong.

I decided to write two separate fixes for these (one fix for bugs 1+2, one
fix for bug 3), so that the first fix can be backported to kernels
affected by bugs 1+2.


This patch (of 2):

This fixes two issues.

I discovered that the following race can occur:

  mfill_atomic                other thread
  ============                ============
                              <zap PMD>
  pmdp_get_lockless() [reads none pmd]
  <bail if trans_huge>
  <if none:>
                              <pagefault creates transhuge zeropage>
    __pte_alloc [no-op]
                              <zap PMD>
  <bail if pmd_trans_huge(*dst_pmd)>
  BUG_ON(pmd_none(*dst_pmd))

I have experimentally verified this in a kernel with extra mdelay() calls;
the BUG_ON(pmd_none(*dst_pmd)) triggers.

On kernels newer than commit 0d940a9b270b (""mm/pgtable: allow
pte_offset_map[_lock]() to fail""), this can't lead to anything worse than
a BUG_ON(), since the page table access helpers are actually designed to
deal with page tables concurrently disappearing; but on older kernels
(<=6.4), I think we could probably theoretically race past the two
BUG_ON() checks and end up treating a hugepage as a page table.

The second issue is that, as Qi Zheng pointed out, there are other types
of huge PMDs that pmd_trans_huge() can't catch: devmap PMDs and swap PMDs
(in particular, migration PMDs).

On <=6.4, this is worse than the first issue: If mfill_atomic() runs on a
PMD that contains a migration entry (which just requires winning a single,
fairly wide race), it will pass the PMD to pte_offset_map_lock(), which
assumes that the PMD points to a page table.

Breakage follows: First, the kernel tries to take the PTE lock (which will
crash or maybe worse if there is no ""struct page"" for the address bits in
the migration entry PMD - I think at least on X86 there usually is no
corresponding ""struct page"" thanks to the PTE inversion mitigation, amd64
looks different).

If that didn't crash, the kernel would next try to write a PTE into what
it wrongly thinks is a page table.

As part of fixing these issues, get rid of the check for pmd_trans_huge()
before __pte_alloc() - that's redundant, we're going to have to check for
that after the __pte_alloc() anyway.

Backport note: pmdp_get_lockless() is pmd_read_atomic() in older kernels."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

mm/slub: add check for s->flags in the alloc_tagging_slab_free_hook

When enable CONFIG_MEMCG & CONFIG_KFENCE & CONFIG_KMEMLEAK, the following
warning always occurs,This is because the following call stack occurred:
mem_pool_alloc
    kmem_cache_alloc_noprof
        slab_alloc_node
            kfence_alloc

Once the kfence allocation is successful,slab->obj_exts will not be empty,
because it has already been assigned a value in kfence_init_pool.

Since in the prepare_slab_obj_exts_hook function,we perform a check for
s->flags & (SLAB_NO_OBJ_EXT | SLAB_NOLEAKTRACE),the alloc_tag_add function
will not be called as a result.Therefore,ref->ct remains NULL.

However,when we call mem_pool_free,since obj_ext is not empty, it
eventually leads to the alloc_tag_sub scenario being invoked.  This is
where the warning occurs.

So we should add corresponding checks in the alloc_tagging_slab_free_hook.
For __GFP_NO_OBJ_EXT case,I didn't see the specific case where it's using
kfence,so I won't add the corresponding check in
alloc_tagging_slab_free_hook for now.

disables the interrupt handler so that no interrupts can be processed while
waking the device. If an interrupt has already occurred then waiting for
the interrupt handler to complete will deadlock because it will be trying

ASoC: Intel: Boards: Fix NULL pointer deref in BYT/CHT boards harder

Since commit 13f58267cda3 (""ASoC: soc.h: don't create dummy Component
via COMP_DUMMY()"") dummy codecs declared like this:

SND_SOC_DAILINK_DEF(dummy,
        DAILINK_COMP_ARRAY(COMP_DUMMY()));

expand to:

static struct snd_soc_dai_link_component dummy[] = {
};

Which means that dummy is a zero sized array and thus dais[i].codecs should
not be dereferenced *at all* since it points to the address of the next
variable stored in the data section as the ""dummy"" variable has an address
but no size, so even dereferencing dais[0] is already an out of bounds
array reference.

Which means that the if (dais[i].codecs->name) check added in
commit 7d99a70b6595 (""ASoC: Intel: Boards: Fix NULL pointer deref
in BYT/CHT boards"") relies on that the part of the next variable which
the name member maps to just happens to be NULL.

Which apparently so far it usually is, except when it isn't
and then it results in crashes like this one:

powerpc/qspinlock: Fix deadlock in MCS queue

If an interrupt occurs in queued_spin_lock_slowpath() after we increment
qnodesp->count and before node->lock is initialized, another CPU might
see stale lock values in get_tail_qnode(). If the stale lock value happens
to match the lock on that CPU, then we write to the ""next"" pointer of
the wrong qnode. This causes a deadlock as the former CPU, once it becomes
the head of the MCS queue, will spin indefinitely until it's ""next"" pointer
is set by its successor in the queue.

Running stress-ng on a 16 core (16EC/16VP) shared LPAR, results in
occasional lockups similar to the following:

When a tensor proto of type VARIANT is unpacked, memory is first allocated to store the entire tensor, and a ctor is called on each instance. Afterwards, Reverb copies the content in tensor_content to the previously mentioned pre-allocated memory, which results in the bytes in tensor_content overwriting the vtable pointers of all the objects which were previously allocated. Reverb exposes 2 relevant gRPC endpoints: InsertStream and SampleStream. The attacker can insert this stream into the server’s database, then when the client next calls SampleStream they will unpack the tensor into RAM, and when any method on that object is called (including its destructor) the attacker gains control of the Program Counter.

CVE-2024-45410	2024-09-19T23:15:11.480	2024-09-25T17:39:08.033	Traefik is a golang, Cloud Native Application Proxy. When a HTTP request is processed by Traefik, certain HTTP headers such as X-Forwarded-Host or X-Forwarded-Port are added by Traefik before the request is routed to the application. For a HTTP client, it should not be possible to remove or modify these headers. Since the application trusts the value of these headers, security implications might arise, if they can be modified. For HTTP/1.1, however, it was found that some of theses custom headers can indeed be removed and in certain cases manipulated. The attack relies on the HTTP/1.1 behavior, that headers can be defined as hop-by-hop via the HTTP Connection header. This issue has been addressed in release versions 2.11.9 and 3.1.3.

Effectively, allowing the proxy defined headers to always win. Users are advised to upgrade. Nginx has a underscores_in_headers configuration variable to discard these headers at the proxy level as a mitigation. Any users that are implicitly trusting the proxy defined headers for security should immediately cease doing so until upgraded to the fixed versions.	5.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

The profile location routine in the referencevalidator commons package is vulnerable to `XML External Entities` attack due to insecure defaults of the used Woodstox WstxInputFactory. A malicious XML resource can lead to network requests issued by referencevalidator and thus to a `Server Side Request Forgery` attack. The vulnerability impacts applications which use referencevalidator to process XML resources from untrusted sources. The problem has been patched with the 2.5.1 version of the referencevalidator. Users are strongly recommended to update to this version or a more recent one. A pre-processing or manual analysis of input XML resources on existence of DTD definitions or external entities can mitigate the problem.	8.6	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVE-2024-45806	2024-09-20T00:15:02.293	2024-10-15T16:03:44.943	Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. A security vulnerability in Envoy allows external clients to manipulate Envoy headers, potentially leading to unauthorized access or other malicious actions within the mesh. This issue arises due to Envoy's default configuration of internal trust boundaries, which considers all RFC1918 private address ranges as internal. The default behavior for handling internal addresses in Envoy has been changed. Previously, RFC1918 IP addresses were automatically considered internal, even if the internal_address_config was empty.  The default configuration of Envoy will continue to trust internal addresses while in this release and it will not trust them by default in next release. If you have tooling such as probes on your private network which need to be treated as trusted (e.g. changing arbitrary x-envoy headers) please explicitly include those addresses or CIDR ranges into `internal_address_config`. Successful exploitation could allow attackers to bypass security controls, access sensitive data, or disrupt services within the mesh, like Istio. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.31.2, 1.30.6, 1.29.9, and 1.28.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

A vulnerability has been identified in Envoy that allows malicious attackers to inject unexpected content into access logs. This is achieved by exploiting the lack of validation for the `REQUESTED_SERVER_NAME` field for access loggers. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.31.2, 1.30.6, 1.29.9, and 1.28.7.

Jwt filter will lead to an Envoy crash when clear route cache with remote JWKs. In the following case: 1. remote JWKs are used, which requires async header processing; 2. clear_route_cache is enabled on the provider; 3. header operations are enabled in JWT filter, e.g. header to claims feature; 4. the routing table is configured in a way that the JWT header operations modify requests to not match any route. When these conditions are met, a crash is triggered in the upstream code due to nullptr reference conversion from route(). The root cause is the ordering of continueDecoding and clearRouteCache. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.31.2, 1.30.6, and 1.29.9. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Envoy will crash when the http async client is handling `sendLocalReply` under some circumstance, e.g., websocket upgrade, and requests mirroring. The http async client will crash during the `sendLocalReply()` in http async client, one reason is http async client is duplicating the status code, another one is the destroy of router is called at the destructor of the async stream, while the stream is deferred deleted at first. There will be problems that the stream decoder is destroyed but its reference is called in `router.onDestroy()`, causing segment fault. This will impact ext_authz if the `upgrade` and `connection` header are allowed, and request mirrorring. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.31.2, 1.30.6, 1.29.9, and 1.28.7.

CVE-2024-47060	2024-09-20T00:15:03.767	2024-09-25T16:43:47.267	Zitadel is an open source identity management platform. In Zitadel, even after an organization is deactivated, associated projects, respectively their applications remain active. Users across other organizations can still log in and access through these applications, leading to unauthorized access. Additionally, if a project was deactivated access to applications was also still possible. The issue stems from the fact that when an organization is deactivated in Zitadel, the applications associated with it do not automatically deactivate. The application lifecycle is not tightly coupled with the organization's lifecycle, leading to a situation where the organization or project is marked as inactive, but its resources remain accessible. This vulnerability allows for unauthorized access to projects and their resources, which should have been restricted post-organization deactivation.

By design, certain APIs, such as the login screen, banner display, and device registration, do not require authentication. However, it was discovered that for Directors directly connected to the Internet, one of these APIs can be exploited by injecting invalid arguments into a GET request, potentially exposing the authentication tokens of other currently logged-in users. These tokens can then be used to invoke additional APIs on port 9183. This exploit does not disclose any username or password information. 

Currently, there are no workarounds in Versa Director. However, if there is Web Application Firewall (WAF) or API Gateway fronting the Versa Director, it can be used to block access to the URLs of vulnerable API.  /vnms/devicereg/device/* (on ports 9182 & 9183) and /versa/vnms/devicereg/device/* (on port 443).

CVE-2024-47061	2024-09-20T19:15:16.550	2024-09-26T13:32:55.343	Plate is a javascript toolkit that makes it easier for you to develop with Slate, a popular framework for building text editors. One longstanding feature of Plate is the ability to add custom DOM attributes to any element or leaf using the `attributes` property. These attributes are passed to the node component using the `nodeProps` prop. It has come to our attention that this feature can be used for malicious purposes, including cross-site scripting (XSS) and information exposure (specifically, users' IP addresses and whether or not they have opened a malicious document). Note that the risk of information exposure via attributes is only relevant to applications in which web requests to arbitrary URLs are not ordinarily allowed. Plate editors that allow users to embed images from arbitrary URLs, for example, already carry the risk of leaking users' IP addresses to third parties. All Plate editors using an affected version of @udecode/plate-core are vulnerable to these information exposure attacks via the style attribute and other attributes that can cause web requests to be sent. In addition, whether or not a Plate editor is vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks using attributes depends on a number of factors. The most likely DOM attributes to be vulnerable are href and src on links and iframes respectively. Any component that spreads {...nodeProps} onto an <a> or <iframe> element and does not later override href or src will be vulnerable to XSS. In patched versions of Plate, we have disabled element.attributes and leaf.attributes for most attribute names by default, with some exceptions including target, alt, width, height, colspan and rowspan on the link, image, video, table cell and table header cell plugins. If this is a breaking change for you, you can selectively re-enable attributes for certain plugins as follows. Please carefully research and assess the security implications of any attribute you allow, as even seemingly innocuous attributes such as style can be used maliciously. If you are unable to upgrade to any of the patched versions, you should use a tool like patch-package or yarn patch to remove the logic from @udecode/plate-core that adds attributes to nodeProps.	8.3	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L		
CVE-2024-47062	2024-09-20T19:15:16.760	2025-08-26T17:45:51.897	Navidrome is an open source web-based music collection server and streamer. Navidrome automatically adds parameters in the URL to SQL queries. This can be exploited to access information by adding parameters like `password=...` in the URL (ORM Leak). Furthermore, the names of the parameters are not properly escaped, leading to SQL Injections. Finally, the username is used in a `LIKE` statement, allowing people to log in with `%` instead of their username. When adding parameters to the URL, they are automatically included in an SQL `LIKE` statement (depending on the parameter's name). This allows attackers to potentially retrieve arbitrary information. For example, attackers can use the following request to test whether some encrypted passwords start with `AAA`. This results in an SQL query like `password LIKE 'AAA%'`, allowing attackers to slowly brute-force passwords. When adding parameters to the URL, they are automatically added to an SQL query. The names of the parameters are not properly escaped. This behavior can be used to inject arbitrary SQL code (SQL Injection). These vulnerabilities can be used to leak information and dump the contents of the database and have been addressed in release version 0.53.0. Users are advised to upgrade.

CVE-2024-47083	2024-09-25T22:15:03.273	2024-10-03T15:11:29.913	Power Platform Terraform Provider allows managing environments and other resources within Power Platform. Versions prior to 3.0.0 have an issue in the Power Platform Terraform Provider where sensitive information, specifically the `client_secret` used in the service principal authentication, may be exposed in logs. This exposure occurs due to an error in the logging code that causes the `client_secret` to not be properly masked when logs are persisted or viewed. Users should upgrade to version 3.0.0 to receive a patched version of the provider that removes all logging of sensitive content. Users who have used this provider with the affected versions should take the following additional steps to mitigate the risk: Immediately rotate the `client_secret` for any service principal that has been configured using this Terraform provider. This will invalidate any potentially exposed secrets. Those who have set the `TF_LOG_PATH` environment variable or configured Terraform to persist logs to a file or an external system, consider disabling this until they have updated to a fixed version of the provider. Those who have existing logs that may contain the `client_secret` should remove or sanitize these logs to prevent unauthorized access. This includes logs on disk, in monitoring systems, or in logging services.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2024-8404	2024-09-26T02:15:02.797	2025-05-13T03:15:23.100	"An arbitrary file deletion vulnerability exists in PaperCut NG/MF, specifically affecting Windows servers with Web Print enabled. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must first obtain local login access to the Windows Server hosting PaperCut NG/MF and be capable of executing low-privilege code directly on the server via the web-print-hot-folder. 

Important: In most installations, this risk is mitigated by the default Windows Server configuration, which restricts local login access to Administrators only. However, this vulnerability could pose a risk to customers who allow non-administrative users to log into the local console of the Windows environment hosting the PaperCut NG/MF application server.

CVE-2024-45042	2024-09-26T18:15:07.463	2024-09-30T12:46:20.237	Ory Kratos is an identity, user management and authentication system for cloud services. Prior to version 1.3.0, given a number of preconditions, the `highest_available` setting will incorrectly assume that the identity’s highest available AAL is `aal1` even though it really is `aal2`. This means that the `highest_available` configuration will act as if the user has only one factor set up, for that particular user. This means that they can call the settings and whoami endpoint without a `aal2` session, even though that should be disallowed. An attacker would need to steal or guess a valid login OTP of a user who has only OTP for login enabled and who has an incorrect `available_aal` value stored, to exploit this vulnerability. All other aspects of the session (e.g. the session’s aal) are not impacted by this issue. On the Ory Network, only 0.00066% of registered users were affected by this issue, and most of those users appeared to be test users. Their respective AAL values have since been updated and they are no longer vulnerable to this attack. Version 1.3.0 is not affected by this issue. As a workaround, those who require MFA should disable the passwordless code login method. If that is not possible, check the sessions `aal` to identify if the user has `aal1` or `aal2`.	4.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVE-2024-47174	2024-09-26T18:15:10.840	2024-09-30T12:46:20.237	Nix is a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. Starting in version 1.11 and prior to versions 2.18.8 and 2.24.8, `<nix/fetchurl.nix>` did not verify TLS certificates on HTTPS connections. This could lead to connection details such as full URLs or credentials leaking in case of a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. `<nix/fetchurl.nix>` is also known as the builtin derivation builder `builtin:fetchurl`. It's not to be confused with the evaluation-time function `builtins.fetchurl`, which was not affected by this issue. A user may be affected by the risk of leaking credentials if they have a `netrc` file for authentication, or rely on derivations with `impureEnvVars` set to use credentials from the environment. In addition, the commonplace trust-on-first-use (TOFU) technique of updating dependencies by specifying an invalid hash and obtaining it from a remote  store was also vulnerable to a MITM injecting arbitrary store objects. This also applied to the impure derivations experimental feature. Note that this may also happen when using Nixpkgs fetchers to obtain new hashes when not using the fake hash method, although that mechanism is not implemented in Nix itself but rather in Nixpkgs using a fixed-output derivation. The behavior was introduced in version 1.11 to make it consistent with the Nixpkgs `pkgs.fetchurl` and to make `<nix/fetchurl.nix>` work in the derivation builder sandbox, which back then did not have access to the CA bundles by default. Nowadays, CA bundles are bind-mounted on Linux. This issue has been fixed in Nix 2.18.8 and 2.24.8. As a workaround, implement (authenticated) fetching with `pkgs.fetchurl` from Nixpkgs, using `impureEnvVars` and `curlOpts` as needed.	5.9	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

Prior to commit 64e00e7, RSSHub's `docker-test-cont.yml` workflow is vulnerable to Artifact Poisoning, which could have lead to a full repository takeover. Downstream users of RSSHub are not vulnerable to this issue, and commit 64e00e7 fixed the underlying issue and made the repository no longer vulnerable. The `docker-test-cont.yml` workflow gets triggered when the `PR - Docker build test` workflow completes successfully. It then collects some information about the Pull Request that triggered the triggering workflow and set some labels depending on the PR body and sender. If the PR also contains a `routes` markdown block, it will set the `TEST_CONTINUE` environment variable to `true`. The workflow then downloads and extracts an artifact uploaded by the triggering workflow which is expected to contain a single `rsshub.tar.zst` file. However, prior to commit 64e00e7, it did not validate and the contents were extracted in the root of the workspace overriding any existing files. Since the contents of the artifact were not validated, it is possible for a malicious actor to send a Pull Request which uploads, not just the `rsshub.tar.zst` compressed docker image, but also a malicious `package.json` file with a script to run arbitrary code in the context of the privileged workflow. As of commit 64e00e7, this scenario has been addressed and the RSSHub repository is no longer vulnerable.	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

sched: sch_cake: fix bulk flow accounting logic for host fairness

In sch_cake, we keep track of the count of active bulk flows per host,
when running in dst/src host fairness mode, which is used as the
round-robin weight when iterating through flows. The count of active
bulk flows is updated whenever a flow changes state.

This has a peculiar interaction with the hash collision handling: when a
hash collision occurs (after the set-associative hashing), the state of
the hash bucket is simply updated to match the new packet that collided,
and if host fairness is enabled, that also means assigning new per-host
state to the flow. For this reason, the bulk flow counters of the
host(s) assigned to the flow are decremented, before new state is
assigned (and the counters, which may not belong to the same host
anymore, are incremented again).

Back when this code was introduced, the host fairness mode was always
enabled, so the decrement was unconditional. When the configuration
flags were introduced the *increment* was made conditional, but
the *decrement* was not. Which of course can lead to a spurious
decrement (and associated wrap-around to U16_MAX).

AFAICT, when host fairness is disabled, the decrement and wrap-around
happens as soon as a hash collision occurs (which is not that common in
itself, due to the set-associative hashing). However, in most cases this
is harmless, as the value is only used when host fairness mode is
enabled. So in order to trigger an array overflow, sch_cake has to first
be configured with host fairness disabled, and while running in this
mode, a hash collision has to occur to cause the overflow. Then, the
qdisc has to be reconfigured to enable host fairness, which leads to the
array out-of-bounds because the wrapped-around value is retained and
used as an array index. It seems that syzbot managed to trigger this,
which is quite impressive in its own right.

This patch fixes the issue by introducing the same conditional check on
decrement as is used on increment.

The original bug predates the upstreaming of cake, but the commit listed
in the Fixes tag touched that code, meaning that this patch won't apply
before that."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Thanks to Thomas Gleixner's analysis, the issue is caused by the low
initial period (1) of the frequency estimation algorithm, which triggers
the defects of the HW, specifically erratum HSW11 and HSW143. (For the
details, please refer https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/87plq9l5d2.ffs@tglx/)

The HSW11 requires a period larger than 100 for the INST_RETIRED.ALL
event, but the initial period in the freq mode is 1. The erratum is the
same as the BDM11, which has been supported in the kernel. A minimum
period of 128 is enforced as well on HSW.

HSW143 is regarding that the fixed counter 1 may overcount 32 with the
Hyper-Threading is enabled. However, based on the test, the hardware
has more issues than it tells. Besides the fixed counter 1, the message
'interrupt took too long' can be observed on any counter which was armed
with a period < 32 and two events expired in the same NMI. A minimum
period of 32 is enforced for the rest of the events.
The recommended workaround code of the HSW143 is not implemented.
Because it only addresses the issue for the fixed counter. It brings
extra overhead through extra MSR writing. No related overcounting issue
has been reported so far."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

x86/hyperv: fix kexec crash due to VP assist page corruption

commit 9636be85cc5b (""x86/hyperv: Fix hyperv_pcpu_input_arg handling when
CPUs go online/offline"") introduces a new cpuhp state for hyperv
initialization.

cpuhp_setup_state() returns the state number if state is
CPUHP_AP_ONLINE_DYN or CPUHP_BP_PREPARE_DYN and 0 for all other states.
For the hyperv case, since a new cpuhp state was introduced it would
return 0. However, in hv_machine_shutdown(), the cpuhp_remove_state() call
is conditioned upon ""hyperv_init_cpuhp > 0"". This will never be true and
so hv_cpu_die() won't be called on all CPUs. This means the VP assist page
won't be reset. When the kexec kernel tries to setup the VP assist page
again, the hypervisor corrupts the memory region of the old VP assist page
causing a panic in case the kexec kernel is using that memory elsewhere.
This was originally fixed in commit dfe94d4086e4 (""x86/hyperv: Fix kexec
panic/hang issues"").

Get rid of hyperv_init_cpuhp entirely since we are no longer using a
dynamic cpuhp state and use CPUHP_AP_HYPERV_ONLINE directly with

CVE-2024-47070	2024-09-27T16:15:05.413	2025-08-21T19:28:44.253	authentik is an open-source identity provider. A vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 allows bypassing password login by adding X-Forwarded-For header with an unparsable IP address, e.g. `a`. This results in a possibility of logging into any account with a known login or email address. The vulnerability requires the authentik instance to trust X-Forwarded-For header provided by the attacker, thus it is not reproducible from external hosts on a properly configured environment.  The issue occurs due to the password stage having a policy bound to it, which skips the password stage if the Identification stage is setup to also contain a password stage. Due to the invalid X-Forwarded-For header, which does not get validated to be an IP Address early enough, the exception happens later and the policy fails. The default blueprint doesn't correctly set `failure_result` to `True` on the policy binding meaning that due to this exception the policy returns false and the password stage is skipped. Versions 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 fix this issue.	9.0	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
