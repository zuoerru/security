CVE-2025-39966	2025-10-15	2025-10-15	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommufd: Fix race during abort for file descriptors

fput() doesn't actually call file_operations release() synchronously, it
puts the file on a work queue and it will be released eventually.

This is normally fine, except for iommufd the file and the iommufd_object
are tied to gether. The file has the object as it's private_data and holds
a users refcount, while the object is expected to remain alive as long as
the file is.

When the allocation of a new object aborts before installing the file it
will fput() the file and then go on to immediately kfree() the obj. This
causes a UAF once the workqueue completes the fput() and tries to
decrement the users refcount.

Fix this by putting the core code in charge of the file lifetime, and call
__fput_sync() during abort to ensure that release() is called before
kfree. __fput_sync() is a bit too tricky to open code in all the object
implementations. Instead the objects tell the core code where the file
pointer is and the core will take care of the life cycle.

If the object is successfully allocated then the file will hold a users
refcount and the iommufd_object cannot be destroyed.

It is worth noting that close(); ioctl(IOMMU_DESTROY); doesn't have an
issue because close() is already using a synchronous version of fput().

The UAF looks like this:

fbcon: fix integer overflow in fbcon_do_set_font

Fix integer overflow vulnerabilities in fbcon_do_set_font() where font
size calculations could overflow when handling user-controlled font
parameters.

The vulnerabilities occur when:
1. CALC_FONTSZ(h, pitch, charcount) performs h * pith * charcount
   multiplication with user-controlled values that can overflow.
2. FONT_EXTRA_WORDS * sizeof(int) + size addition can also overflow
3. This results in smaller allocations than expected, leading to buffer
   overflows during font data copying.

This can be prevented by reading futex_q::task before updating the

because requeue_pi_wake_futex() is invoked with a spinlock_t held which
implies a RCU read section.

Even if T1 terminates immediately after, the task_struct will remain valid
during T2's wake_up_state().  A READ_ONCE on futex_q::task before
futex_requeue_pi_complete() is enough because it ensures that the variable
is read before the state is updated.

Read futex_q::task before updating the requeue state, use it for the

nexthop: Forbid FDB status change while nexthop is in a group

The kernel forbids the creation of non-FDB nexthop groups with FDB
nexthops:

 # ip nexthop add id 1 via 192.0.2.1 fdb

 Error: FDB nexthop group can only have fdb nexthops.

However, as long as no routes are pointing to a non-FDB nexthop group,

This attemps to fix possible UAFs caused by struct mgmt_pending being
freed while still being processed like in the following trace, in order
to fix mgmt_pending_valid is introduce and use to check if the
mgmt_pending hasn't been removed from the pending list, on the complete
callbacks it is used to check and in addtion remove the cmd from the list
while holding mgmt_pending_lock to avoid TOCTOU problems since if the cmd
is left on the list it can still be accessed and freed.

can: mcba_usb: populate ndo_change_mtu() to prevent buffer overflow

Sending an PF_PACKET allows to bypass the CAN framework logic and to

which is performed by the PF_PACKET framework is to make sure that
skb->len fits the interface's MTU.

Unfortunately, because the mcba_usb driver does not populate its
net_device_ops->ndo_change_mtu(), it is possible for an attacker to
configure an invalid MTU by doing, for example:

  $ ip link set can0 mtu 9999

	struct canxl_frame frame = {

The proper fix would be around not exposing this partially-valid tree to
others when droping the mmap lock, which is being solved with [1].  A
simpler solution would be checking for MMF_UNSTABLE, as it is set if

The iMON driver improperly releases the usb_device reference in
imon_disconnect without coordinating with active users of the
device.

Specifically, the fields usbdev_intf0 and usbdev_intf1 are not
protected by the users counter (ictx->users). During probe,
imon_init_intf0 or imon_init_intf1 increments the usb_device
reference count depending on the interface. However, during
disconnect, usb_put_dev is called unconditionally, regardless of
actual usage.

As a result, if vfd_write or other operations are still in
progress after disconnect, this can lead to a use-after-free of
the usb_device pointer.

media: tuner: xc5000: Fix use-after-free in xc5000_release

The original code uses cancel_delayed_work() in xc5000_release(), which
does not guarantee that the delayed work item timer_sleep has fully
completed if it was already running. This leads to use-after-free scenarios
where xc5000_release() may free the xc5000_priv while timer_sleep is still
active and attempts to dereference the xc5000_priv.

A typical race condition is illustrated below:

CPU 0 (release thread)                 | CPU 1 (delayed work callback)
xc5000_release()                       | xc5000_do_timer_sleep()

Replace cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() to ensure
that the timer_sleep is properly canceled before the xc5000_priv memory
is deallocated.

A deadlock concern was considered: xc5000_release() is called in a process
context and is not holding any locks that the timer_sleep work item might
also need. Therefore, the use of the _sync() variant is safe here.

Replace cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() to ensure
that the delayed work item is properly canceled and any executing delayed
work has finished before the device memory is deallocated.

This bug was initially identified through static analysis. To reproduce
and test it, I simulated the B2C2 FlexCop PCI device in QEMU and introduced
artificial delays within the flexcop_pci_irq_check_work() function to
increase the likelihood of triggering the bug."					
CVE-2025-39997	2025-10-15	2025-10-15	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: usb-audio: fix race condition to UAF in snd_usbmidi_free

The previous commit 0718a78f6a9f (""ALSA: usb-audio: Kill timer properly at
removal"") patched a UAF issue caused by the error timer.

However, because the error timer kill added in this patch occurs after the
endpoint delete, a race condition to UAF still occurs, albeit rarely.

Additionally, since kill-cleanup for urb is also missing, freed memory can
be accessed in interrupt context related to urb, which can cause UAF.

Therefore, to prevent this, error timer and urb must be killed before
freeing the heap memory."					
CVE-2025-39998	2025-10-15	2025-10-15	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: target: target_core_configfs: Add length check to avoid buffer overflow

A buffer overflow arises from the usage of snprintf to write into the
buffer ""buf"" in target_lu_gp_members_show function located in
/drivers/target/target_core_configfs.c. This buffer is allocated with
size LU_GROUP_NAME_BUF (256 bytes).

snprintf(...) formats multiple strings into buf with the HBA name
(hba->hba_group.cg_item), a slash character, a devicename (dev->
dev_group.cg_item) and a newline character, the total formatted string
length may exceed the buffer size of 256 bytes.

Since snprintf() returns the total number of bytes that would have been
written (the length of %s/%sn ), this value may exceed the buffer length
(256 bytes) passed to memcpy(), this will ultimately cause function
memcpy reporting a buffer overflow error.

An additional check of the return value of snprintf() can avoid this
buffer overflow."					
CVE-2025-39999	2025-10-15	2025-10-15	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-mq: fix blk_mq_tags double free while nr_requests grown

In the case user trigger tags grow by queue sysfs attribute nr_requests,
hctx->sched_tags will be freed directly and replaced with a new
allocated tags, see blk_mq_tag_update_depth().

The problem is that hctx->sched_tags is from elevator->et->tags, while
et->tags is still the freed tags, hence later elevator exit will try to
free the tags again, causing kernel panic.

Fix this problem by replacing et->tags with new allocated tags as well.

Noted there are still some long term problems that will require some
refactor to be fixed thoroughly[1].

CVE-2025-55039	2025-10-15	2025-10-15	"This issue affects Apache Spark versions before  3.4.4,Â 3.5.2 and 4.0.0.



Apache Spark versions before 4.0.0, 3.5.2 and 3.4.4 use an insecure default network encryption cipher for RPC communication between nodes.

When spark.network.crypto.enabled is set to true (it is set to false by default), but spark.network.crypto.cipher is not explicitly configured, Spark defaults to AES in CTR mode (AES/CTR/NoPadding), which provides encryption without authentication.

This vulnerability allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to modify encrypted RPC traffic undetected by flipping bits in ciphertext, potentially compromising heartbeat messages or application data and affecting the integrity of Spark workflows.


To mitigate this issue, users should either configure spark.network.crypto.cipher to AES/GCM/NoPadding to enable authenticated encryption or

enable SSL encryption by setting spark.ssl.enabled to true, which provides stronger transport security."	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

CVE-2025-59419	2025-10-15	2025-10-15	Netty is an asynchronous, event-driven network application framework. In versions prior to 4.1.128.Final and 4.2.7.Final, the SMTP codec in Netty contains an SMTP command injection vulnerability due to insufficient input validation for Carriage Return (\r) and Line Feed (\n) characters in user-supplied parameters. The vulnerability exists in io.netty.handler.codec.smtp.DefaultSmtpRequest, where parameters are directly concatenated into the SMTP command string without sanitization. When methods such as SmtpRequests.rcpt(recipient) are called with a malicious string containing CRLF sequences, attackers can inject arbitrary SMTP commands. Because the injected commands are sent from the server's trusted IP address, resulting emails will likely pass SPF and DKIM authentication checks, making them appear legitimate. This allows remote attackers who can control SMTP command parameters (such as email recipients) to forge arbitrary emails from the trusted server, potentially impersonating executives and forging high-stakes corporate communications. This issue has been patched in versions 4.1.129.Final and 4.2.8.Final. No known workarounds exist.

CVE-2025-62370	2025-10-15	2025-10-15	Alloy Core libraries at the root of the Rust Ethereum ecosystem. Prior to 0.8.26 and 1.4.1, an uncaught panic triggered by malformed input to alloy_dyn_abi::TypedData could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) via eip712_signing_hash(). Software with high availability requirements such as network services may be particularly impacted. If in use, external auto-restarting mechanisms can partially mitigate the availability issues unless repeated attacks are possible. The vulnerability was patched by adding a check to ensure the element is not empty before accessing its first element; an error is returned if it is empty. The fix is included in version v1.4.1 and backported to v0.8.26.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2025-62379	2025-10-15	2025-10-15	Reflex is a library to build full-stack web apps in pure Python. In versions 0.5.4 through 0.8.14, the /auth-codespace endpoint automatically assigns the redirect_to query parameter value directly to client-side links without any validation and triggers automatic clicks when the page loads in a GitHub Codespaces environment. This allows attackers to redirect users to arbitrary external URLs. The vulnerable route is only registered when a Codespaces environment is detected, and the detection is controlled by environment variables. The same behavior can be activated in production if the GITHUB_CODESPACES_PORT_FORWARDING_DOMAIN environment variable is set. The vulnerability occurs because the code assigns the redirect_to query parameter directly to a.href without any validation and immediately triggers a click (automatic navigation), allowing users to be sent to arbitrary external domains. The execution condition is based on the presence of a sessionStorage flag, meaning it triggers immediately on first visits or in incognito/private browsing windows, with no server-side origin/scheme whitelist or internal path enforcement defenses in place. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.15. As a workaround, users can ensure that GITHUB_CODESPACES_PORT_FORWARDING_DOMAIN is not set in a production environment.	3.1	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

CVE-2025-62378	2025-10-15	2025-10-15	CommandKit is the discord.js meta-framework for building Discord bots. In versions 1.2.0-rc.1 through 1.2.0-rc.11, a logic flaw exists in the message command handler that affects how the commandName property is exposed to both middleware functions and command execution contexts when handling command aliases. When a message command is invoked using an alias, the ctx.commandName value reflects the alias rather than the canonical command name. This occurs in both middleware functions and within the command's own run function. Although not explicitly documented, CommandKit's examples and guidance around middleware usage implicitly convey that ctx.commandName represents the canonical command identifier. Middleware examples in the documentation consistently use ctx.commandName to reference the command being executed. Developers who assume ctx.commandName is canonical may introduce unintended behavior when relying on it for logic such as permission checks, rate limiting, or audit logging. This could allow unauthorized command execution or inaccurate access control decisions. Slash commands and context menu commands are not affected. This issue has been patched in version 1.2.0-rc.12, where ctx.commandName now consistently returns the actual canonical command name regardless of the alias used to invoke it.	6.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2025-62380	2025-10-15	2025-10-15	mailgen is a Node.js package that generates responsive HTML e-mails for sending transactional mail. Mailgen versions through 2.0.31 contain an HTML injection vulnerability in plaintext emails generated with the generatePlaintext method when user generated content is supplied. The plaintext generation code attempts to strip HTML tags using a regular expression and then decodes HTML entities, but tags that include certain Unicode line separator characters are not matched and removed. These encoded tags are later decoded into valid HTML content, allowing unexpected HTML to remain in output intended to be plaintext. Projects are affected if they call Mailgen.generatePlaintext with untrusted input and then render or otherwise process the returned string in a context where HTML is interpreted. This can lead to execution of attacker supplied script in the victimâs browser. Version 2.0.32 fixes the issue.					
CVE-2025-62371	2025-10-15	2025-10-15	OpenSearch Data Prepper as an open source data collector for observability data. In versions prior to 2.12.2, the OpenSearch sink and source plugins in Data Prepper trust all SSL certificates by default when no certificate path is provided. Prior to this fix, the OpenSearch sink and source plugins would automatically use a trust all SSL strategy when connecting to OpenSearch clusters if no certificate path was explicitly configured. This behavior bypasses SSL certificate validation, potentially allowing attackers to intercept and modify data in transit through man-in-the-middle attacks. The vulnerability affects connections to OpenSearch when the cert parameter is not explicitly provided. This issue has been patched in version 2.12.2. As a workaround, users can add the cert parameter to their OpenSearch sink or source configuration with the path to the cluster's CA certificate.	7.4	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

CVE-2025-62382	2025-10-15	2025-10-15	Frigate is a network video recorder (NVR) with realtime local object detection for IP cameras. Prior to 0.16.2, Frigate's export workflow allows an authenticated operator to nominate any filesystem location as the thumbnail source for a video export. Because that path is copied verbatim into the publicly served clips directory, the feature can be abused to read arbitrary files that reside on the host running Frigate. In practice, a low-privilege user with API access can pivot from viewing camera footage to exfiltrating sensitive configuration files, secrets, or user data from the appliance itself. This behavior violates the principle of least privilege for the export subsystem and turns a convenience feature into a direct information disclosure vector, with exploitation hinging on a short race window while the background exporter copies the chosen file into place before cleanup runs. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.16.2.	7.7	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

In go-witness versions 0.8.6 and earlier and witness versions 0.9.2 and earlier the AWS attestor improperly verifies AWS EC2 instance identity documents. Verification can incorrectly succeed when a signature is not present or is empty, and when RSA signature verification fails. The attestor also embeds a single legacy global AWS public certificate and does not account for newer region specific certificates issued in 2024, making detection of forged documents difficult without additional trusted region data. An attacker able to supply or intercept instance identity document data (such as through Instance Metadata Service impersonation) can cause a forged identity document to be accepted, leading to incorrect trust decisions based on the attestation. This is fixed in go-witness 0.9.1 and witness 0.10.1. As a workaround, manually verify the included identity document, signature, and public key with standard tools (for example openssl) following AWSâs verification guidance, or disable use of the AWS attestor until upgraded.					
CVE-2025-11683	2025-10-16	2025-10-16	"YAML::Syck versions before 1.36 for Perl has missing null-terminators which causes out-of-bounds read and potential information disclosure

Missing null terminators in token.c leads to but-of-bounds read which allows adjacent variable to be read

The issue is seen with complex YAML files with a hash of all keys and empty values.Â  There is no indication that the issue leads to accessing memory outside that allocated to the module."
