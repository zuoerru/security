Further investigation showed that it was not a security issue. Notes: Red Hat Product Security does not consider this as a security flaw. Password changes aren't expected to invalidate existing sessions. Though this is how Kerberos behaves: incrementing kvno will not invalidate any existing service tickets. This is not a concern because the lifetime on service tickets should be set appropriately (initially only a global, now also more finely configurable with the kdcpolicy plugin). This belief is reinforced by our use of mod_session: existing sessions there aren't terminated, but instead wait for expiration

CVE-2020-4035	2020-06-03T17:15:26.153	2024-11-21T05:32:11.750	"In WatermelonDB (NPM package ""@nozbe/watermelondb"") before versions 0.15.1 and 0.16.2, a maliciously crafted record ID can exploit a SQL Injection vulnerability in iOS adapter implementation and cause the app to delete all or selected records from the database, generally causing the app to become unusable. This may happen in apps that don't validate IDs (valid IDs are `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-.]+$/`) and use Watermelon Sync or low-level `database.adapter.destroyDeletedRecords` method. The integrity risk is low due to the fact that maliciously deleted records won't synchronize, so logout-login will restore all data, although some local changes may be lost if the malicious deletion causes the sync process to fail to proceed to push stage. No way to breach confidentiality with this vulnerability is known. Full exploitation of SQL Injection is mitigated, because it's not possible to nest an insert/update query inside a delete query in SQLite, and it's not possible to pass a semicolon-separated second query. There's also no known practicable way to breach confidentiality by selectively deleting records, because those records will not be synchronized. It's theoretically possible that selective record deletion could cause an app to behave insecurely if lack of a record is used to make security decisions by the app. This is patched in versions 0.15.1, 0.16.2, and 0.16.1-fix"	5.9	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H

CVE-2020-11091	2020-06-03T23:15:11.167	2024-11-21T04:56:46.143	In Weave Net before version 2.6.3, an attacker able to run a process as root in a container is able to respond to DNS requests from the host and thereby insert themselves as a fake service. In a cluster with an IPv4 internal network, if IPv6 is not totally disabled on the host (via ipv6.disable=1 on the kernel cmdline), it will be either unconfigured or configured on some interfaces, but it's pretty likely that ipv6 forwarding is disabled, ie /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf//forwarding == 0. Also by default, /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf//accept_ra == 1. The combination of these 2 sysctls means that the host accepts router advertisements and configure the IPv6 stack using them. By sending rogue router advertisements, an attacker can reconfigure the host to redirect part or all of the IPv6 traffic of the host to the attacker controlled container. Even if there was no IPv6 traffic before, if the DNS returns A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) records, many HTTP libraries will try to connect via IPv6 first then fallback to IPv4, giving an opportunity to the attacker to respond. If by chance you also have on the host a vulnerability like last year's RCE in apt (CVE-2019-3462), you can now escalate to the host.

CVE-2020-11094	2020-06-04T00:15:10.817	2024-11-21T04:56:46.410	The October CMS debugbar plugin before version 3.1.0 contains a feature where it will log all requests (and all information pertaining to each request including session data) whenever it is enabled. This presents a problem if the plugin is ever enabled on a system that is open to untrusted users as the potential exists for them to use this feature to view all requests being made to the application and obtain sensitive information from those requests. There even exists the potential for account takeovers of authenticated users by non-authenticated public users, which would then lead to a number of other potential issues as an attacker could theoretically get full access to the system if the required conditions existed. Issue has been patched in v3.1.0 by locking down access to the debugbar to all users; it now requires an authenticated backend user with a specifically enabled permission before it is even usable, and the feature that allows access to stored request information is restricted behind a different permission that's more restrictive.	6.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVE-2020-12847	2020-06-04T20:15:11.737	2024-11-21T05:00:23.847	Pydio Cells 2.0.4 web application offers an administrative console named “Cells Console” that is available to users with an administrator role. This console provides an administrator user with the possibility of changing several settings, including the application’s mailer configuration. It is possible to configure a few engines to be used by the mailer application to send emails. If the user selects the “sendmail” option as the default one, the web application offers to edit the full path where the sendmail binary is hosted. Since there is no restriction in place while editing this value, an attacker authenticated as an administrator user could force the web application into executing any arbitrary binary.	7.2	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2020-12852	2020-06-04T20:15:11.880	2024-11-21T05:00:24.630	The update feature for Pydio Cells 2.0.4 allows an administrator user to set a custom update URL and the public RSA key used to validate the downloaded update package. The update process involves downloading the updated binary file from a URL indicated in the update server response, validating its checksum and signature with the provided public key and finally replacing the current application binary. To complete the update process, the application’s service or appliance needs to be restarted. An attacker with administrator access can leverage the software update feature to force the application to download a custom binary that will replace current Pydio Cells binary. When the server or service is eventually restarted the attacker will be able to execute code under the privileges of the user running the application. In the Pydio Cells enterprise appliance this is with the privileges of the user named “pydio”.	6.8	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

By default, only an ""admin"" can actually invoke on an MBean. However there is a vulnerability there for someone who is not an admin, but has a ""viewer"" role. In the 'etc/jmx.acl.cfg', such as role can call get*. It's possible to authenticate as a viewer role + invokes on the MLet getMBeansFromURL method, which goes off to a remote server to fetch the desired MBean, which is then registered in Karaf. At this point the attack fails as ""viewer"" doesn't have the permission to invoke on the MBean. Still, it could act as a SSRF style attack and also it essentially allows a ""viewer"" role to pollute the MBean registry, which is a kind of privilege escalation. The vulnerability is low as it's possible to add a ACL to limit access. Users should update to Apache Karaf 4.2.9 or newer."	6.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

Instead, arbitrary memory content is transmitted within in the padding bytes of the frame. Most likely this memory contains slices from previously transmitted or received frames. By this method, memory content is disclosed, however, an attacker can hardly control which memory content is affected.

CVE-2017-9106	2020-06-18T14:15:10.467	2024-11-21T03:35:19.873	An issue was discovered in adns before 1.5.2. adns_rr_info mishandles a bogus *datap. The general pattern for formatting integers is to sprintf into a fixed-size buffer. This is correct if the input is in the right range; if it isn't, the buffer may be overrun (depending on the sizes of the types on the current platform). Of course the inputs ought to be right. And there are pointers in there too, so perhaps one could say that the caller ought to check these things. It may be better to require the caller to make the pointer structure right, but to have the code here be defensive about (and tolerate with an error but without crashing) out-of-range integer values. So: it should defend each of these integer conversion sites with a check for the actual permitted range, and return adns_s_invaliddata if not. The lack of this check causes the SOA sign extension bug to be a serious security problem: the sign extended SOA value is out of range, and overruns the buffer when reconverted. This is related to sign extending SOA 32-bit integer fields, and use of a signed data type.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2017-9107	2020-06-18T14:15:10.530	2024-11-21T03:35:20.033	An issue was discovered in adns before 1.5.2. It overruns reading a buffer if a domain ends with backslash. If the query domain ended with \, and adns_qf_quoteok_query was specified, qdparselabel would read additional bytes from the buffer and try to treat them as the escape sequence. It would depart the input buffer and start processing many bytes of arbitrary heap data as if it were the query domain. Eventually it would run out of input or find some other kind of error, and declare the query domain invalid. But before then it might outrun available memory and crash. In principle this could be a denial of service attack.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2017-9108	2020-06-18T14:15:10.593	2024-11-21T03:35:20.200	An issue was discovered in adns before 1.5.2. adnshost mishandles a missing final newline on a stdin read. It is wrong to increment used as well as setting r, since used is incremented according to r, later. Rather one should be doing what read() would have done. Without this fix, adnshost may read and process one byte beyond the buffer, perhaps crashing or perhaps somehow leaking the value of that byte.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2017-9109	2020-06-18T14:15:10.640	2024-11-21T03:35:20.363	An issue was discovered in adns before 1.5.2. It fails to ignore apparent answers before the first RR that was found the first time. when this is fixed, the second answer scan finds the same RRs at the first. Otherwise, adns can be confused by interleaving answers for the CNAME target, with the CNAME itself. In that case the answer data structure (on the heap) can be overrun. With this fixed, it prefers to look only at the answer RRs which come after the CNAME, which is at least arguably correct.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2020-12883	2020-06-18T19:15:09.893	2024-11-21T05:00:29.127	Buffer over-reads were discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS 5.15.3. The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP packets. The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse() parses CoAP input linearly using a while loop. Once an option is parsed in a loop, the current point (*packet_data_pptr) is increased correspondingly. The pointer is restricted by the size of the received buffer, as well as by the option delta and option length bytes. The actual input packet length is not verified against the number of bytes read when processing the option extended delta and the option extended length. Moreover, the calculation of the message_left variable, in the case of non-extended option deltas, is incorrect and indicates more data left for processing than provided in the function input. All of these lead to heap-based or stack-based memory location read access that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer. Depending on the platform-specific memory management mechanisms, it can lead to processing of unintended inputs or system memory access violation errors.	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2020-12884	2020-06-18T19:15:09.973	2024-11-21T05:00:29.287	A buffer over-read was discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS 5.15.3. The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP packets. The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse_multiple_options() parses CoAP options that may occur multiple consecutive times in a single packet. While processing the options, packet_data_pptr is accessed after being incremented by option_len without a prior out-of-bounds memory check. The temp_parsed_uri_query_ptr is validated for a correct range, but the range valid for temp_parsed_uri_query_ptr is derived from the amount of allocated heap memory, not the actual input size. Therefore the check of temp_parsed_uri_query_ptr may be insufficient for safe access to the area pointed to by packet_data_pptr. As a result, access to a memory area outside of the intended boundary of the packet buffer is made.	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2020-12885	2020-06-18T19:15:10.050	2024-11-21T05:00:29.437	An infinite loop was discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS 5.15.3. The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP packets. The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse_multiple_options() parses CoAP options in a while loop. This loop's exit condition is computed using the previously allocated heap memory required for storing the result of parsing multiple options. If the input heap memory calculation results in zero bytes, the loop exit condition is never met and the loop is not terminated. As a result, the packet parsing function never exits, leading to resource consumption.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2020-12886	2020-06-18T19:15:11.567	2024-11-21T05:00:29.590	A buffer over-read was discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS 5.15.3. The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP packets. The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse() parses the CoAP packet header starting from the message token. The length of the token in the received message is provided in the first byte parsed by the sn_coap_parser_options_parse() function. The length encoded in the message is not validated against the actual input buffer length before accessing the token. As a result, memory access outside of the intended boundary of the buffer may occur.	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2020-12887	2020-06-18T19:15:11.783	2024-11-21T05:00:29.737	Memory leaks were discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS 5.15.3 when using the Arm mbed-coap library 5.1.5. The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP packets. The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse() parses the CoAP option number field of all options present in the input packet. Each option number is calculated as a sum of the previous option number and a delta of the current option. The delta and the previous option number are expressed as unsigned 16-bit integers. Due to lack of overflow detection, it is possible to craft a packet that wraps the option number around and results in the same option number being processed again in a single packet. Certain options allocate memory by calling a memory allocation function. In the cases of COAP_OPTION_URI_QUERY, COAP_OPTION_URI_PATH, COAP_OPTION_LOCATION_QUERY, and COAP_OPTION_ETAG, there is no check on whether memory has already been allocated, which in conjunction with the option number integer overflow may lead to multiple assignments of allocated memory to a single pointer. This has been demonstrated to lead to memory leak by buffer orphaning. As a result, the memory is never freed.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

This bug is triggered on 32-bit machines when the CUPS server responds with a message (https://doc.sm.tc/station/cupsproto.html#http-post-response) where the signature length is larger than 2 GByte (never happens in practice), or the response is crafted specifically to trigger this issue (i.e. the length signature field indicates a value larger than (2**31)-1 although the signature actually does not contain that much data). In such a scenario, on 32 bit machines, Basic Station would execute a code path, where a piece of memory is accessed after it has been freed, causing the process to crash and restarted again. The CUPS transaction is typically mutually authenticated over TLS. Therefore, in order to trigger this vulnerability, the attacker would have to gain access to the CUPS server first. If the user chose to operate without authentication over TLS but yet is concerned about this vulnerability, one possible workaround is to enable TLS authentication.

This allows an attacker to gain full read & write access to the Conjur Postgres database, including escalating the attacker's privileges to assume full control. A malicious actor who knows the IP address and port number of the Postgres database and has access into the Kubernetes cluster where Conjur runs can gain full read & write access to the Postgres database. This enables the attacker to write a policy that allows full access to retrieve any secret. This Helm chart is a method to install Conjur OSS into a Kubernetes environment. Hence, the systems impacted are only Conjur OSS systems that were deployed using this chart. Other deployments including Docker and the CyberArk Dynamic Access Provider (DAP) are not affected. To remediate this vulnerability, clone the latest Helm Chart and follow the upgrade instructions. If you are not able to fully remediate this vulnerability immediately, you can mitigate some of the risk by making sure Conjur OSS is deployed on an isolated Kubernetes cluster or namespace. The term ""isolated"" refers to: - No other workloads besides Conjur OSS and its backend database are running in that Kubernetes cluster/namespace. - Kubernetes and helm access to the cluster/namespace is limited to security administrators via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)."	8.7	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N

CVE-2020-4071	2020-06-24T13:15:11.833	2024-11-21T05:32:15.157	In django-basic-auth-ip-whitelist before 0.3.4, a potential timing attack exists on websites where the basic authentication is used or configured, i.e. BASIC_AUTH_LOGIN and BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD is set. Currently the string comparison between configured credentials and the ones provided by users is performed through a character-by-character string comparison. This enables a possibility that attacker may time the time it takes the server to validate different usernames and password, and use this knowledge to work out the valid credentials. This attack is understood not to be realistic over the Internet. However, it may be achieved from within local networks where the website is hosted, e.g. from inside a data centre where a website's server is located. Sites protected by IP address whitelisting only are unaffected by this vulnerability. This vulnerability has been fixed on version 0.3.4 of django-basic-auth-ip-whitelist. Update to version 0.3.4 as soon as possible and change basic authentication username and password configured on a Django project using this package. A workaround without upgrading to version 0.3.4 is to stop using basic authentication and use the IP whitelisting component only. It can be achieved by not setting BASIC_AUTH_LOGIN and BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD in Django project settings.	2.2	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N

CVE-2020-2021	2020-06-29T15:15:12.733	2025-02-07T15:03:31.663	When Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication is enabled and the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is disabled (unchecked), improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to access protected resources. The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable server to exploit this vulnerability. This issue affects PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.3; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.9; PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.15, and all versions of PAN-OS 8.0 (EOL). This issue does not affect PAN-OS 7.1. This issue cannot be exploited if SAML is not used for authentication. This issue cannot be exploited if the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is enabled (checked) in the SAML Identity Provider Server Profile. Resources that can be protected by SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) authentication are: GlobalProtect Gateway, GlobalProtect Portal, GlobalProtect Clientless VPN, Authentication and Captive Portal, PAN-OS next-generation firewalls (PA-Series, VM-Series) and Panorama web interfaces, Prisma Access In the case of GlobalProtect Gateways, GlobalProtect Portal, Clientless VPN, Captive Portal, and Prisma Access, an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the affected servers can gain access to protected resources if allowed by configured authentication and Security policies. There is no impact on the integrity and availability of the gateway, portal or VPN server. An attacker cannot inspect or tamper with sessions of regular users. In the worst case, this is a critical severity vulnerability with a CVSS Base Score of 10.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N). In the case of PAN-OS and Panorama web interfaces, this issue allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the PAN-OS or Panorama web interfaces to log in as an administrator and perform administrative actions. In the worst-case scenario, this is a critical severity vulnerability with a CVSS Base Score of 10.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). If the web interfaces are only accessible to a restricted management network, then the issue is lowered to a CVSS Base Score of 9.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).
