Unclear documentation of the error behavior in `ParseWithClaims` can lead to situation where users are potentially not checking errors in the way they should be. Especially, if a token is both expired and invalid, the errors returned by `ParseWithClaims` return both error codes. If users only check for the `jwt.ErrTokenExpired ` using `error.Is`, they will ignore the embedded `jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid` and thus potentially accept invalid tokens. A fix has been back-ported with the error handling logic from the `v5` branch to the `v4` branch. In this logic, the `ParseWithClaims` function will immediately return in ""dangerous"" situations (e.g., an invalid signature), limiting the combined errors only to situations where the signature is valid, but further validation failed (e.g., if the signature is valid, but is expired AND has the wrong audience). This fix is part of the 4.5.1 release. We are aware that this changes the behaviour of an established function and is not 100 % backwards compatible, so updating to 4.5.1 might break your code.

CVE-2024-51501	2024-11-04T23:15:04.893	2024-11-08T16:15:50.200	Refit is an automatic type-safe REST library for .NET Core, Xamarin and .NET The various header-related Refit attributes (Header, HeaderCollection and Authorize) are vulnerable to CRLF injection. The way HTTP headers are added to a request is via the `HttpHeaders.TryAddWithoutValidation` method. This method does not check for CRLF characters in the header value. This means that any headers added to a refit request are vulnerable to CRLF-injection. In general, CRLF-injection into a HTTP header (when using HTTP/1.1) means that one can inject additional HTTP headers or smuggle whole HTTP requests. If an application using the Refit library passes a user-controllable value through to a header, then that application becomes vulnerable to CRLF-injection. This is not necessarily a security issue for a command line application like the one above, but if such code were present in a web application then it becomes vulnerable to request splitting (as shown in the PoC) and thus Server Side Request Forgery. Strictly speaking this is a potential vulnerability in applications using Refit and not in Refit itself. This issue has been addressed in release versions 7.2.22 and 8.0.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

CVE-2023-52920	2024-11-05T10:15:24.580	2025-01-09T16:15:35.587	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: support non-r10 register spill/fill to/from stack in precision tracking

Use instruction (jump) history to record instructions that performed
register spill/fill to/from stack, regardless if this was done through
read-only r10 register, or any other register after copying r10 into it
*and* potentially adjusting offset.

To make this work reliably, we push extra per-instruction flags into
instruction history, encoding stack slot index (spi) and stack frame
number in extra 10 bit flags we take away from prev_idx in instruction
history. We don't touch idx field for maximum performance, as it's
checked most frequently during backtracking.

This change removes basically the last remaining practical limitation of
precision backtracking logic in BPF verifier. It fixes known
deficiencies, but also opens up new opportunities to reduce number of
verified states, explored in the subsequent patches.

There are only three differences in selftests' BPF object files
according to veristat, all in the positive direction (less states).

File                                    Program        Insns (A)  Insns (B)  Insns  (DIFF)  States (A)  States (B)  States (DIFF)
--------------------------------------  -------------  ---------  ---------  -------------  ----------  ----------  -------------
test_cls_redirect_dynptr.bpf.linked3.o  cls_redirect        2987       2864  -123 (-4.12%)         240         231    -9 (-3.75%)
xdp_synproxy_kern.bpf.linked3.o         syncookie_tc       82848      82661  -187 (-0.23%)        5107        5073   -34 (-0.67%)
xdp_synproxy_kern.bpf.linked3.o         syncookie_xdp      85116      84964  -152 (-0.18%)        5162        5130   -32 (-0.62%)

Note, I avoided renaming jmp_history to more generic insn_hist to
minimize number of lines changed and potential merge conflicts between
bpf and bpf-next trees.

Notice also cur_hist_entry pointer reset to NULL at the beginning of
instruction verification loop. This pointer avoids the problem of
relying on last jump history entry's insn_idx to determine whether we
already have entry for current instruction or not. It can happen that we
added jump history entry because current instruction is_jmp_point(), but
also we need to add instruction flags for stack access. In this case, we
don't want to entries, so we need to reuse last added entry, if it is
present.

Relying on insn_idx comparison has the same ambiguity problem as the one
that was fixed recently in [0], so we avoid that.

By default xe_bb_create_job() appends a MI_BATCH_BUFFER_END to batch
buffer, this is not a problem if batch buffer is only used once but
oa reuses the batch buffer for the same metric and at each call
it appends a MI_BATCH_BUFFER_END, printing the warning below and then
overflowing.

nouveau/dmem: Fix vulnerability in migrate_to_ram upon copy error

The `nouveau_dmem_copy_one` function ensures that the copy push command is
sent to the device firmware but does not track whether it was executed
successfully.

In the case of a copy error (e.g., firmware or hardware failure), the
copy push command will be sent via the firmware channel, and
`nouveau_dmem_copy_one` will likely report success, leading to the
`migrate_to_ram` function returning a dirty HIGH_USER page to the user.

This can result in a security vulnerability, as a HIGH_USER page that may
contain sensitive or corrupted data could be returned to the user.

To prevent this vulnerability, we allocate a zero page. Thus, in case of

There is a history of deadlock if reboot is performed at the beginning
of booting. SDEV_QUIESCE was set for all LU's scsi_devices by UFS
shutdown, and at that time the audio driver was waiting on
blk_mq_submit_bio() holding a mutex_lock while reading the fw binary.
After that, a deadlock issue occurred while audio driver shutdown was
waiting for mutex_unlock of blk_mq_submit_bio(). To solve this, set
SDEV_OFFLINE for all LUs except WLUN, so that any I/O that comes down
after a UFS shutdown will return an error.

CVE-2024-50099	2024-11-05T18:15:13.690	2025-10-01T21:15:46.770	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: probes: Remove broken LDR (literal) uprobe support

The simulate_ldr_literal() and simulate_ldrsw_literal() functions are
unsafe to use for uprobes. Both functions were originally written for
use with kprobes, and access memory with plain C accesses. When uprobes
was added, these were reused unmodified even though they cannot safely
access user memory.

There are three key problems:

1) The plain C accesses do not have corresponding extable entries, and
   thus if they encounter a fault the kernel will treat these as
   unintentional accesses to user memory, resulting in a BUG() which
   will kill the kernel thread, and likely lead to further issues (e.g.
   lockup or panic()).

2) The plain C accesses are subject to HW PAN and SW PAN, and so when
   either is in use, any attempt to simulate an access to user memory
   will fault. Thus neither simulate_ldr_literal() nor
   simulate_ldrsw_literal() can do anything useful when simulating a
   user instruction on any system with HW PAN or SW PAN.

3) The plain C accesses are privileged, as they run in kernel context,
   and in practice can access a small range of kernel virtual addresses.
   The instructions they simulate have a range of +/-1MiB, and since the
   simulated instructions must itself be a user instructions in the
   TTBR0 address range, these can address the final 1MiB of the TTBR1
   acddress range by wrapping downwards from an address in the first
   1MiB of the TTBR0 address range.

   In contemporary kernels the last 8MiB of TTBR1 address range is
   reserved, and accesses to this will always fault, meaning this is no
   worse than (1).

   Historically, it was theoretically possible for the linear map or
   vmemmap to spill into the final 8MiB of the TTBR1 address range, but
   in practice this is extremely unlikely to occur as this would
   require either:

   * Having enough physical memory to fill the entire linear map all the
     way to the final 1MiB of the TTBR1 address range.

   * Getting unlucky with KASLR randomization of the linear map such
     that the populated region happens to overlap with the last 1MiB of
     the TTBR address range.

   ... and in either case if we were to spill into the final page there
   would be larger problems as the final page would alias with error
   pointers.

Practically speaking, (1) and (2) are the big issues. Given there have
been no reports of problems since the broken code was introduced, it
appears that no-one is relying on probing these instructions with
uprobes.

Avoid these issues by not allowing uprobes on LDR (literal) and LDRSW
(literal), limiting the use of simulate_ldr_literal() and
simulate_ldrsw_literal() to kprobes. Attempts to place uprobes on LDR
(literal) and LDRSW (literal) will be rejected as
arm_probe_decode_insn() will return INSN_REJECTED. In future we can
consider introducing working uprobes support for these instructions, but
this will require more significant work."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

USB: gadget: dummy-hcd: Fix ""task hung"" problem

The syzbot fuzzer has been encountering ""task hung"" problems ever
since the dummy-hcd driver was changed to use hrtimers instead of
regular timers.  It turns out that the problems are caused by a subtle
difference between the timer_pending() and hrtimer_active() APIs.

The changeover blindly replaced the first by the second.  However,
timer_pending() returns True when the timer is queued but not when its
callback is running, whereas hrtimer_active() returns True when the
hrtimer is queued _or_ its callback is running.  This difference
occasionally caused dummy_urb_enqueue() to think that the callback
routine had not yet started when in fact it was almost finished.  As a
result the hrtimer was not restarted, which made it impossible for the
driver to dequeue later the URB that was just enqueued.  This caused
usb_kill_urb() to hang, and things got worse from there.

Since hrtimers have no API for telling when they are queued and the
callback isn't running, the driver must keep track of this for itself.
That's what this patch does, adding a new ""timer_pending"" flag and
setting or clearing it at the appropriate times."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

x86: fix user address masking non-canonical speculation issue

It turns out that AMD has a ""Meltdown Lite(tm)"" issue with non-canonical
accesses in kernel space.  And so using just the high bit to decide
whether an access is in user space or kernel space ends up with the good
old ""leak speculative data"" if you have the right gadget using the
result:

  CVE-2020-12965 “Transient Execution of Non-Canonical Accesses“

Now, the kernel surrounds the access with a STAC/CLAC pair, and those
instructions end up serializing execution on older Zen architectures,
which closes the speculation window.

But that was true only up until Zen 5, which renames the AC bit [1].
That improves performance of STAC/CLAC a lot, but also means that the
speculation window is now open.

Note that this affects not just the new address masking, but also the
regular valid_user_address() check used by access_ok(), and the asm
version of the sign bit check in the get_user() helpers.

It does not affect put_user() or clear_user() variants, since there's no

soundcards"") moved the allocation of Soundwire stream runtime from the
Qualcomm Soundwire driver to each individual machine sound card driver,
except that it forgot to update SC7280 card.

Just like for other Qualcomm sound cards using Soundwire, the card
driver should allocate and release the runtime.  Otherwise sound
playback will result in a NULL pointer dereference or other effect of
uninitialized memory accesses (which was confirmed on SDM845 having
similar issue)."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

nfsd: fix race between laundromat and free_stateid

There is a race between laundromat handling of revoked delegations
and a client sending free_stateid operation. Laundromat thread
finds that delegation has expired and needs to be revoked so it
marks the delegation stid revoked and it puts it on a reaper list
but then it unlock the state lock and the actual delegation revocation
happens without the lock. Once the stid is marked revoked a racing
free_stateid processing thread does the following (1) it calls
list_del_init() which removes it from the reaper list and (2) frees
the delegation stid structure. The laundromat thread ends up not
calling the revoke_delegation() function for this particular delegation
but that means it will no release the lock lease that exists on
the file.

Now, a new open for this file comes in and ends up finding that
lease list isn't empty and calls nfsd_breaker_owns_lease() which ends
up trying to derefence a freed delegation stateid. Leading to the
followint use-after-free KASAN warning:

This patch proposes a fixed that's based on adding 2 new additional
stid's sc_status values that help coordinate between the laundromat
and other operations (nfsd4_free_stateid() and nfsd4_delegreturn()).

First to make sure, that once the stid is marked revoked, it is not
removed by the nfsd4_free_stateid(), the laundromat take a reference
on the stateid. Then, coordinating whether the stid has been put
on the cl_revoked list or we are processing FREE_STATEID and need to
make sure to remove it from the list, each check that state and act
accordingly. If laundromat has added to the cl_revoke list before
the arrival of FREE_STATEID, then nfsd4_free_stateid() knows to remove
it from the list. If nfsd4_free_stateid() finds that operations arrived
before laundromat has placed it on cl_revoke list, it marks the state
freed and then laundromat will no longer add it to the list.

Also, for nfsd4_delegreturn() when looking for the specified stid,
we need to access stid that are marked removed or freeable, it means
the laundromat has started processing it but hasn't finished and this
delegreturn needs to return nfserr_deleg_revoked and not
nfserr_bad_stateid. The latter will not trigger a FREE_STATEID and the
lack of it will leave this stid on the cl_revoked list indefinitely."	7.0	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Upon closer inspection, it appears that we do not properly tear down the
MMIO registration for a vCPU that fails creation late in the game, e.g.
a vCPU w/ the same ID already exists in the VM.

It is important to consider the context of commit that introduced this bug
by moving the unregistration out of __kvm_vgic_vcpu_destroy(). That
change correctly sought to avoid an srcu v. config_lock inversion by
breaking up the vCPU teardown into two parts, one guarded by the
config_lock.

Fix the use-after-free while avoiding lock inversion by adding a
special-cased unregistration to __kvm_vgic_vcpu_destroy(). This is safe
because failed vCPUs are torn down outside of the config_lock."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

KVM: nSVM: Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory

Ignore nCR3[4:0] when loading PDPTEs from memory for nested SVM, as bits
4:0 of CR3 are ignored when PAE paging is used, and thus VMRUN doesn't
enforce 32-byte alignment of nCR3.

In the absolute worst case scenario, failure to ignore bits 4:0 can result
in an out-of-bounds read, e.g. if the target page is at the end of a
memslot, and the VMM isn't using guard pages.

Per the APM:

  The CR3 register points to the base address of the page-directory-pointer
  table. The page-directory-pointer table is aligned on a 32-byte boundary,
  with the low 5 address bits 4:0 assumed to be 0.

And the SDM's much more explicit:

  4:0    Ignored

Note, KVM gets this right when loading PDPTRs, it's only the nSVM flow
that is broken."	7.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H

nilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of buffer delay flag

Syzbot reported that after nilfs2 reads a corrupted file system image
and degrades to read-only, the BUG_ON check for the buffer delay flag
in submit_bh_wbc() may fail, causing a kernel bug.

This is because the buffer delay flag is not cleared when clearing the
buffer state flags to discard a page/folio or a buffer head. So, fix
this.

This became necessary when the use of nilfs2's own page clear routine
was expanded.  This state inconsistency does not occur if the buffer

[CAUSE]
To support mounting different subvolume with different RO/RW flags for
the new mount APIs, btrfs introduced two workaround to support this feature:

- Skip mount option/feature checks if we are mounting a different
  subvolume

- Reconfigure the fs to RW if the initial mount is RO

Combining these two, we can have the following sequence:

- Mount the fs ro,rescue=all,clear_cache,space_cache=v1
  rescue=all will mark the fs as hard read-only, so no v2 cache clearing
  will happen.

- Mount a subvolume rw of the same fs.
  We go into btrfs_get_tree_subvol(), but fc_mount() returns EBUSY
  because our new fc is RW, different from the original fs.

  Now we enter btrfs_reconfigure_for_mount(), which switches the RO flag
  first so that we can grab the existing fs_info.
  Then we reconfigure the fs to RW.

- During reconfiguration, option/features check is skipped
  This means we will restart the v2 cache clearing, and convert back to
  v1 cache.
  This will trigger fs writes, and since the original fs has ""rescue=all""
  option, it skips the csum tree read.

  And eventually causing NULL pointer dereference in super block
  writeback.

[FIX]
For reconfiguration caused by different subvolume RO/RW flags, ensure we
always run btrfs_check_options() to ensure we have proper hard RO
requirements met.

In fact the function btrfs_check_options() doesn't really do many
complex checks, but hard RO requirement and some feature dependency
checks, thus there is no special reason not to do the check for mount
reconfiguration."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-49377	2024-11-05T19:15:05.737	2024-12-18T16:31:26.757	OctoPrint provides a web interface for controlling consumer 3D printers. OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.10.2 contain reflected XSS vulnerabilities in the login dialog and the standalone application key confirmation dialog.  An attacker who successfully talked a victim into clicking on a specially crafted login link, or a malicious app running on a victim's computer triggering the application key workflow with specially crafted parameters and then redirecting the victim to the related standalone confirmation dialog could use this to retrieve or modify sensitive configuration settings, interrupt prints or otherwise interact with the OctoPrint instance in a malicious way. The above mentioned specific vulnerabilities of the login dialog and the standalone application key confirmation dialog have been patched in the bugfix release 1.10.3 by individual escaping of the detected locations. A global change throughout all of OctoPrint's templating system with the upcoming 1.11.0 release will handle this further, switching to globally enforced automatic escaping and thus reducing the attack surface in general. The latter will also improve the security of third party plugins. During a transition period, third party plugins will be able to opt into the automatic escaping. With OctoPrint 1.13.0, automatic escaping will be switched over to be enforced even for third party plugins, unless they explicitly opt-out.	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

The parameters used for the search are the public key and the payload. The search API returns entries that match either condition rather than both. When gitsign's credential cache is used, there can be multiple entries that use the same ephemeral keypair / signing certificate. As gitsign assumes both conditions are matched by Rekor, there is no additional validation that the entry's hash matches the payload being verified, meaning that the wrong entry can be used to successfully pass verification. Impact is minimal as while gitsign does not match the payload against the entry, it does ensure that the certificate matches. This would need to be exploited during the certificate validity window (10 minutes) by the key holder.

CVE-2024-9681	2024-11-06T08:15:03.740	2024-12-13T14:15:22.953	"When curl is asked to use HSTS, the expiry time for a subdomain might
overwrite a parent domain's cache entry, making it end sooner or later than
otherwise intended.

This affects curl using applications that enable HSTS and use URLs with the
insecure `HTTP://` scheme and perform transfers with hosts like
`x.example.com` as well as `example.com` where the first host is a subdomain
of the second host.

(The HSTS cache either needs to have been populated manually or there needs to
have been previous HTTPS accesses done as the cache needs to have entries for
the domains involved to trigger this problem.)

When `x.example.com` responds with `Strict-Transport-Security:` headers, this
bug can make the subdomain's expiry timeout *bleed over* and get set for the
parent domain `example.com` in curl's HSTS cache.

The result of a triggered bug is that HTTP accesses to `example.com` get
converted to HTTPS for a different period of time than what was asked for by
the origin server. If `example.com` for example stops supporting HTTPS at its
expiry time, curl might then fail to access `http://example.com` until the
(wrongly set) timeout expires. This bug can also expire the parent's entry
*earlier*, thus making curl inadvertently switch back to insecure HTTP earlier
than otherwise intended."	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L

	       -> rt_spin_lock()

The rq lock is a raw_spinlock_t. We can't sleep while holding
it. IOW, we can't call alloc_pages() in stack_depot_save_flags().

The task_tick_mm_cid() function with its task_work_add() call was
introduced by commit 223baf9d17f2 (""sched: Fix performance regression
introduced by mm_cid"") in v6.4 kernel.

Fortunately, there is a kasan_record_aux_stack_noalloc() variant that
calls stack_depot_save_flags() while not allowing it to allocate
new pages.  To allow task_tick_mm_cid() to use task_work without
page allocation, a new TWAF_NO_ALLOC flag is added to enable calling
kasan_record_aux_stack_noalloc() instead of kasan_record_aux_stack()
if set. The task_tick_mm_cid() function is modified to add this new flag.

The possible downside is the missing stack trace in a KASAN report due
to new page allocation required when task_work_add_noallloc() is called
which should be rare."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

ACPI: PRM: Find EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME block for PRM handler and context

PRMT needs to find the correct type of block to translate the PA-VA
mapping for EFI runtime services.

The issue arises because the PRMT is finding a block of type
EFI_CONVENTIONAL_MEMORY, which is not appropriate for runtime services
as described in Section 2.2.2 (Runtime Services) of the UEFI
Specification [1]. Since the PRM handler is a type of runtime service,
this causes an exception when the PRM handler is called.

    [Firmware Bug]: Unable to handle paging request in EFI runtime service

Let PRMT find a block with EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME for PRM handler and PRM
context.

If no suitable block is found, a warning message will be printed, but
the procedure continues to manage the next PRM handler.

However, if the PRM handler is actually called without proper allocation,
it would result in a failure during error handling.

By using the correct memory types for runtime services, ensure that the
PRM handler and the context are properly mapped in the virtual address
space during runtime, preventing the paging request error.

The issue is really that only memory that has been remapped for runtime
by the firmware can be used by the PRM handler, and so the region needs
to have the EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME attribute.

octep_napi_poll() that the Rx pressure is going down. As there is no
associated skb in this case, don't process the packets and don't push them
up the network stack - they are skipped.

Helper function is implemented to unmmap/flush all the fragment buffers
used by the dropped packet. 'alloc_failures' counter is incremented to
mark the skb allocation error in driver statistics.

net/mlx5e: Don't call cleanup on profile rollback failure

When profile rollback fails in mlx5e_netdev_change_profile, the netdev
profile var is left set to NULL. Avoid a crash when unloading the driver
by not calling profile->cleanup in such a case.

This was encountered while testing, with the original trigger that
the wq rescuer thread creation got interrupted (presumably due to
Ctrl+C-ing modprobe), which gets converted to ENOMEM (-12) by
mlx5e_priv_init, the profile rollback also fails for the same reason
(signal still active) so the profile is left as NULL, leading to a crash
later in _mlx5e_remove.

net/mlx5: Fix command bitmask initialization

Command bitmask have a dedicated bit for MANAGE_PAGES command, this bit
isn't Initialize during command bitmask Initialization, only during
MANAGE_PAGES.

In addition, mlx5_cmd_trigger_completions() is trying to trigger
completion for MANAGE_PAGES command as well.

Hence, in case health error occurred before any MANAGE_PAGES command
have been invoke (for example, during mlx5_enable_hca()),
mlx5_cmd_trigger_completions() will try to trigger completion for
MANAGE_PAGES command, which will result in null-ptr-deref error.[1]

Fix it by Initialize command bitmask correctly.

While at it, re-write the code for better understanding.

tcp/dccp: Don't use timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink().

Martin KaFai Lau reported use-after-free [0] in reqsk_timer_handler().

  """"""
  We are seeing a use-after-free from a bpf prog attached to
  trace_tcp_retransmit_synack. The program passes the req->sk to the
  bpf_sk_storage_get_tracing kernel helper which does check for null
  before using it.
  """"""

The commit 83fccfc3940c (""inet: fix potential deadlock in
reqsk_queue_unlink()"") added timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink() not
to call del_timer_sync() from reqsk_timer_handler(), but it introduced a
small race window.

Before the timer is called, expire_timers() calls detach_timer(timer, true)
to clear timer->entry.pprev and marks it as not pending.

If reqsk_queue_unlink() checks timer_pending() just after expire_timers()
calls detach_timer(), TCP will miss del_timer_sync(); the reqsk timer will
continue running and send multiple SYN+ACKs until it expires.

The reported UAF could happen if req->sk is close()d earlier than the timer
expiration, which is 63s by default.

The scenario would be

  1. inet_csk_complete_hashdance() calls inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop(),
     but del_timer_sync() is missed

  2. reqsk timer is executed and scheduled again

  3. req->sk is accept()ed and reqsk_put() decrements rsk_refcnt, but
     reqsk timer still has another one, and inet_csk_accept() does not
     clear req->sk for non-TFO sockets

  4. sk is close()d

  5. reqsk timer is executed again, and BPF touches req->sk

Let's not use timer_pending() by passing the caller context to
__inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop().

Note that reqsk timer is pinned, so the issue does not happen in most
use cases. [1]

drm/msm: Avoid NULL dereference in msm_disp_state_print_regs()

If the allocation in msm_disp_state_dump_regs() failed then
`block->state` can be NULL. The msm_disp_state_print_regs() function
_does_ have code to try to handle it with:

  if (*reg)
    dump_addr = *reg;

...but since ""dump_addr"" is initialized to NULL the above is actually
a noop. The code then goes on to dereference `dump_addr`.

Make the function print ""Registers not stored"" when it sees a NULL to
solve this. Since we're touching the code, fix
msm_disp_state_print_regs() not to pointlessly take a double-pointer
and properly mark the pointer as `const`.

bpf: Make sure internal and UAPI bpf_redirect flags don't overlap

The bpf_redirect_info is shared between the SKB and XDP redirect paths,
and the two paths use the same numeric flag values in the ri->flags
field (specifically, BPF_F_BROADCAST == BPF_F_NEXTHOP). This means that
if skb bpf_redirect_neigh() is used with a non-NULL params argument and,
subsequently, an XDP redirect is performed using the same
bpf_redirect_info struct, the XDP path will get confused and end up
crashing, which syzbot managed to trigger.

With the stack-allocated bpf_redirect_info, the structure is no longer
shared between the SKB and XDP paths, so the crash doesn't happen
anymore. However, different code paths using identically-numbered flag
values in the same struct field still seems like a bit of a mess, so
this patch cleans that up by moving the flag definitions together and
redefining the three flags in BPF_F_REDIRECT_INTERNAL to not overlap
with the flags used for XDP. It also adds a BUILD_BUG_ON() check to make
sure the overlap is not re-introduced by mistake."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2024-50164	2024-11-07T10:15:07.697	2025-01-17T14:15:31.720	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix overloading of MEM_UNINIT's meaning

Lonial reported an issue in the BPF verifier where check_mem_size_reg()
has the following code:

    if (!tnum_is_const(reg->var_off))
        /* For unprivileged variable accesses, disable raw
         * mode so that the program is required to
         * initialize all the memory that the helper could
         * just partially fill up.
         */
         meta = NULL;

This means that writes are not checked when the register containing the
size of the passed buffer has not a fixed size. Through this bug, a BPF
program can write to a map which is marked as read-only, for example,
.rodata global maps.

The problem is that MEM_UNINIT's initial meaning that ""the passed buffer
to the BPF helper does not need to be initialized"" which was added back
in commit 435faee1aae9 (""bpf, verifier: add ARG_PTR_TO_RAW_STACK type"")
got overloaded over time with ""the passed buffer is being written to"".

The problem however is that checks such as the above which were added later
via 06c1c049721a (""bpf: allow helpers access to variable memory"") set meta
to NULL in order force the user to always initialize the passed buffer to
the helper. Due to the current double meaning of MEM_UNINIT, this bypasses
verifier write checks to the memory (not boundary checks though) and only
assumes the latter memory is read instead.

Fix this by reverting MEM_UNINIT back to its original meaning, and having
MEM_WRITE as an annotation to BPF helpers in order to then trigger the
BPF verifier checks for writing to memory.

Some notes: check_arg_pair_ok() ensures that for ARG_CONST_SIZE{,_OR_ZERO}
we can access fn->arg_type[arg - 1] since it must contain a preceding
ARG_PTR_TO_MEM. For check_mem_reg() the meta argument can be removed
altogether since we do check both BPF_READ and BPF_WRITE. Same for the
equivalent check_kfunc_mem_size_reg()."	7.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H

Default configuration of client's IP address detection in IPAuthenticationProvider, which uses HTTP request headers, is weak and allows an attacker to bypass authentication via spoofing client's IP address in request headers. Default configuration honors X-Forwarded-For HTTP header to read client's IP address. X-Forwarded-For request header is mainly used by proxy servers to identify the client and can be easily spoofed by an attacker pretending that the request comes from a different IP address. Admin Server commands, such as snapshot and restore arbitrarily can be executed on successful exploitation which could potentially lead to information leakage or service availability issues.

CVE-2024-51758	2024-11-07T18:15:17.787	2024-11-21T17:15:23.143	Filament is a collection of full-stack components for accelerated Laravel development. All Filament features that interact with storage use the `default_filesystem_disk` config option. This allows the user to easily swap their storage driver to something production-ready like `s3` when deploying their app, without having to touch multiple configuration options and potentially forgetting about some. The default disk is set to `public` when you first install Filament, since this allows users to quickly get started developing with a functional disk that allows features such as file upload previews locally without the need to set up an S3 disk with temporary URL support. However, some features of Filament such as exports also rely on storage, and the files that are stored contain data that should often not be public. This is not an issue for the many deployed applications, since many use a secure default disk such as S3 in production. However, [CWE-1188](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1188.html) suggests that having the `public` disk as the default disk in Filament is a security vulnerability itself. As such, we have implemented a measure to protect users whereby if the `public` disk is set as the default disk, the exports feature will automatically swap it out for the `local` disk, if that exists. Users who set the default disk to `local` or `s3` already are not affected. If a user wants to continue to use the `public` disk for exports, they can by setting the export disk deliberately. This change has been included in the 3.2.123 release and all users who use the `public` disk are advised to upgrade.

XStream 1.4.21 has been patched to detect the manipulation in the binary input stream causing the the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may catch the StackOverflowError in the client code calling XStream if XStream is configured to use the BinaryStreamDriver.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2024-51987	2024-11-08T00:15:15.233	2024-11-08T19:01:03.880	Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect is a set of .NET libraries that manage OAuth and OpenId Connect access tokens. HTTP Clients created by `AddUserAccessTokenHttpClient` may use a different user's access token after a token refresh occurs. This occurs because a refreshed token will be captured in pooled `HttpClient` instances, which may be used by a different user. Instead of using `AddUserAccessTokenHttpClient` to create an `HttpClient` that automatically adds a managed token to outgoing requests, you can use the `HttpConext.GetUserAccessTokenAsync` extension method or the `IUserTokenManagementService.GetAccessTokenAsync` method. This issue is fixed in Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect 3.0.1. All users are advised to upgrade.

The validation for the file URI scheme falls short, and results in an attacker being able to read any file on the system. This issue only affects instances with a webdriver enabled, and `ALLOW_FILE_URI` false or not defined. The check used for URL protocol, `is_safe_url`, allows `file:` as a URL scheme. It later checks if local files are permitted, but one of the preconditions for the check is that the URL starts with `file://`. The issue comes with the fact that the file URI scheme is not required to have double slashes. This issue has been addressed in version 0.47.06 and all users are advised to upgrade.

media: qcom: camss: Remove use_count guard in stop_streaming

The use_count check was introduced so that multiple concurrent Raw Data
Interfaces RDIs could be driven by different virtual channels VCs on the
CSIPHY input driving the video pipeline.

This is an invalid use of use_count though as use_count pertains to the
number of times a video entity has been opened by user-space not the number
of active streams.

If use_count and stream-on count don't agree then stop_streaming() will
break as is currently the case and has become apparent when using CAMSS
with libcamera's released softisp 0.3.

The use of use_count like this is a bit hacky and right now breaks regular
usage of CAMSS for a single stream case. Stopping qcam results in the splat
below, and then it cannot be started again and any attempts to do so fails
with -EBUSY.

One CAMSS specific way to handle multiple VCs on the same RDI might be:

- Reference count each pipeline enable for CSIPHY, CSID, VFE and RDIx.
- The video buffers are already associated with msm_vfeN_rdiX so
  release video buffers when told to do so by stop_streaming.
- Only release the power-domains for the CSIPHY, CSID and VFE when
  their internal refcounts drop.

Either way refusing to release video buffers based on use_count is
erroneous and should be reverted. The silicon enabling code for selecting
VCs is perfectly fine. Its a ""known missing feature"" that concurrent VCs
won't work with CAMSS right now.

Initial testing with this code didn't show an error but, SoftISP and ""real""
usage with Google Hangouts breaks the upstream code pretty quickly, we need
to do a partial revert and take another pass at VCs.

secretmem: disable memfd_secret() if arch cannot set direct map

Return -ENOSYS from memfd_secret() syscall if !can_set_direct_map().  This
is the case for example on some arm64 configurations, where marking 4k
PTEs in the direct map not present can only be done if the direct map is
set up at 4k granularity in the first place (as ARM's break-before-make
semantics do not easily allow breaking apart large/gigantic pages).

More precisely, on arm64 systems with !can_set_direct_map(),
set_direct_map_invalid_noflush() is a no-op, however it returns success
(0) instead of an error.  This means that memfd_secret will seemingly
""work"" (e.g.  syscall succeeds, you can mmap the fd and fault in pages),
but it does not actually achieve its goal of removing its memory from the
direct map.

Note that with this patch, memfd_secret() will start erroring on systems
where can_set_direct_map() returns false (arm64 with
CONFIG_RODATA_FULL_DEFAULT_ENABLED=n, CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=n and
CONFIG_KFENCE=n), but that still seems better than the current silent
failure.  Since CONFIG_RODATA_FULL_DEFAULT_ENABLED defaults to 'y', most
arm64 systems actually have a working memfd_secret() and aren't be
affected.

From going through the iterations of the original memfd_secret patch
series, it seems that disabling the syscall in these scenarios was the
intended behavior [1] (preferred over having
set_direct_map_invalid_noflush return an error as that would result in
SIGBUSes at page-fault time), however the check for it got dropped between
v16 [2] and v17 [3], when secretmem moved away from CMA allocations.

arm64: probes: Fix uprobes for big-endian kernels

The arm64 uprobes code is broken for big-endian kernels as it doesn't
convert the in-memory instruction encoding (which is always
little-endian) into the kernel's native endianness before analyzing and
simulating instructions. This may result in a few distinct problems:

* The kernel may may erroneously reject probing an instruction which can
  safely be probed.

* The kernel may erroneously erroneously permit stepping an
  instruction out-of-line when that instruction cannot be stepped
  out-of-line safely.

* The kernel may erroneously simulate instruction incorrectly dur to
  interpretting the byte-swapped encoding.

The endianness mismatch isn't caught by the compiler or sparse because:

* The arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields are encoded as arrays of u8, so
  the compiler and sparse have no idea these contain a little-endian
  32-bit value. The core uprobes code populates these with a memcpy()
  which similarly does not handle endianness.

* While the uprobe_opcode_t type is an alias for __le32, both
  arch_uprobe_analyze_insn() and arch_uprobe_skip_sstep() cast from u8[]
  to the similarly-named probe_opcode_t, which is an alias for u32.
  Hence there is no endianness conversion warning.

Fix this by changing the arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields to __le32 and
adding the appropriate __le32_to_cpu() conversions prior to consuming
the instruction encoding. The core uprobes copies these fields as opaque
ranges of bytes, and so is unaffected by this change.

At the same time, remove MAX_UINSN_BYTES and consistently use
AARCH64_INSN_SIZE for clarity.

maple_tree: correct tree corruption on spanning store

Patch series ""maple_tree: correct tree corruption on spanning store"", v3.

There has been a nasty yet subtle maple tree corruption bug that appears
to have been in existence since the inception of the algorithm.

This bug seems far more likely to happen since commit f8d112a4e657
(""mm/mmap: avoid zeroing vma tree in mmap_region()""), which is the point
at which reports started to be submitted concerning this bug.

We were made definitely aware of the bug thanks to the kind efforts of
Bert Karwatzki who helped enormously in my being able to track this down
and identify the cause of it.

The bug arises when an attempt is made to perform a spanning store across
two leaf nodes, where the right leaf node is the rightmost child of the
shared parent, AND the store completely consumes the right-mode node.

This results in mas_wr_spanning_store() mitakenly duplicating the new and
existing entries at the maximum pivot within the range, and thus maple
tree corruption.

The fix patch corrects this by detecting this scenario and disallowing the
mistaken duplicate copy.

The fix patch commit message goes into great detail as to how this occurs.

This series also includes a test which reliably reproduces the issue, and
asserts that the fix works correctly.

Bert has kindly tested the fix and confirmed it resolved his issues.  Also
Mikhail Gavrilov kindly reported what appears to be precisely the same
bug, which this fix should also resolve.


This patch (of 2):

There has been a subtle bug present in the maple tree implementation from
its inception.

This arises from how stores are performed - when a store occurs, it will
overwrite overlapping ranges and adjust the tree as necessary to
accommodate this.

A range may always ultimately span two leaf nodes.  In this instance we
walk the two leaf nodes, determine which elements are not overwritten to
the left and to the right of the start and end of the ranges respectively
and then rebalance the tree to contain these entries and the newly
inserted one.

This kind of store is dubbed a 'spanning store' and is implemented by
mas_wr_spanning_store().

In order to reach this stage, mas_store_gfp() invokes
mas_wr_preallocate(), mas_wr_store_type() and mas_wr_walk() in turn to
walk the tree and update the object (mas) to traverse to the location
where the write should be performed, determining its store type.

When a spanning store is required, this function returns false stopping at
the parent node which contains the target range, and mas_wr_store_type()
marks the mas->store_type as wr_spanning_store to denote this fact.

When we go to perform the store in mas_wr_spanning_store(), we first
determine the elements AFTER the END of the range we wish to store (that
is, to the right of the entry to be inserted) - we do this by walking to
the NEXT pivot in the tree (i.e.  r_mas.last + 1), starting at the node we
have just determined contains the range over which we intend to write.

We then turn our attention to the entries to the left of the entry we are
inserting, whose state is represented by l_mas, and copy these into a 'big
node', which is a special node which contains enough slots to contain two
leaf node's worth of data.

We then copy the entry we wish to store immediately after this - the copy
and the insertion of the new entry is performed by mas_store_b_node().

After this we copy the elements to the right of the end of the range which
we are inserting, if we have not exceeded the length of the node (i.e. 
r_mas.offset <= r_mas.end).

Herein lies the bug - under very specific circumstances, this logic can
break and corrupt the maple tree.

Consider the following tree:

Height
  0                             Root Node
                                 /      \
                 pivot = 0xffff /        \ pivot = ULONG_MAX

nilfs2: propagate directory read errors from nilfs_find_entry()

Syzbot reported that a task hang occurs in vcs_open() during a fuzzing
test for nilfs2.

The root cause of this problem is that in nilfs_find_entry(), which
searches for directory entries, ignores errors when loading a directory
page/folio via nilfs_get_folio() fails.

If the filesystem images is corrupted, and the i_size of the directory
inode is large, and the directory page/folio is successfully read but
fails the sanity check, for example when it is zero-filled,
nilfs_check_folio() may continue to spit out error messages in bursts.

Fix this issue by propagating the error to the callers when loading a
page/folio fails in nilfs_find_entry().

The current interface of nilfs_find_entry() and its callers is outdated
and cannot propagate error codes such as -EIO and -ENOMEM returned via
nilfs_find_entry(), so fix it together."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

fork: do not invoke uffd on fork if error occurs

Patch series ""fork: do not expose incomplete mm on fork"".

During fork we may place the virtual memory address space into an
inconsistent state before the fork operation is complete.

In addition, we may encounter an error during the fork operation that
indicates that the virtual memory address space is invalidated.

As a result, we should not be exposing it in any way to external machinery
that might interact with the mm or VMAs, machinery that is not designed to
deal with incomplete state.

We specifically update the fork logic to defer khugepaged and ksm to the
end of the operation and only to be invoked if no error arose, and
disallow uffd from observing fork events should an error have occurred.


This patch (of 2):

Currently on fork we expose the virtual address space of a process to
userland unconditionally if uffd is registered in VMAs, regardless of
whether an error arose in the fork.

This is performed in dup_userfaultfd_complete() which is invoked
unconditionally, and performs two duties - invoking registered handlers
for the UFFD_EVENT_FORK event via dup_fctx(), and clearing down
userfaultfd_fork_ctx objects established in dup_userfaultfd().

This is problematic, because the virtual address space may not yet be
correctly initialised if an error arose.

The change in commit d24062914837 (""fork: use __mt_dup() to duplicate
maple tree in dup_mmap()"") makes this more pertinent as we may be in a
state where entries in the maple tree are not yet consistent.

We address this by, on fork error, ensuring that we roll back state that
we would otherwise expect to clean up through the event being handled by
userland and perform the memory freeing duty otherwise performed by
dup_userfaultfd_complete().

We do this by implementing a new function, dup_userfaultfd_fail(), which
performs the same loop, only decrementing reference counts.

Note that we perform mmgrab() on the parent and child mm's, however
userfaultfd_ctx_put() will mmdrop() this once the reference count drops to
zero, so we will avoid memory leaks correctly here."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Empirically we can confirm that the former allocates 152 bytes for the
table, while the latter memsets the 168 large block.

Root cause appears that when GPU metrics tables for v2_4 parts were added
it was not considered to enlarge the table to fit.

The fix in this patch is rather ""brute force"" and perhaps later should be
done in a smarter way, by extracting and consolidating the part version to
size logic to a common helper, instead of brute forcing the largest
possible allocation. Nevertheless, for now this works and fixes the out of
bounds write.

stress-ng-vm-segv in stress-ng is used to stress test the SIGSEGV error
handling function of the system, which tries to cause a SIGSEGV error on
return from unmapping the whole address space of the child process.

Normally this program will not cause kernel crashes. But before the
munmap system call returns to user mode, a potential task_numa_work()
for numa balancing could be added and executed. In this scenario, since the
child process has no vma after munmap, the vma_next() in task_numa_work()
will return a null pointer even if the vma iterator restarts from 0.

btrfs: fix error propagation of split bios

The purpose of btrfs_bbio_propagate_error() shall be propagating an error
of split bio to its original btrfs_bio, and tell the error to the upper
layer. However, it's not working well on some cases.

* Case 1. Immediate (or quick) end_bio with an error

When btrfs sends btrfs_bio to mirrored devices, btrfs calls
btrfs_bio_end_io() when all the mirroring bios are completed. If that
btrfs_bio was split, it is from btrfs_clone_bioset and its end_io function
is btrfs_orig_write_end_io. For this case, btrfs_bbio_propagate_error()
accesses the orig_bbio's bio context to increase the error count.

That works well in most cases. However, if the end_io is called enough
fast, orig_bbio's (remaining part after split) bio context may not be
properly set at that time. Since the bio context is set when the orig_bbio
(the last btrfs_bio) is sent to devices, that might be too late for earlier
split btrfs_bio's completion.  That will result in NULL pointer
dereference.

That bug is easily reproducible by running btrfs/146 on zoned devices [1]
and it shows the following trace.

[1] You need raid-stripe-tree feature as it create ""-d raid0 -m raid1"" FS.

At 1) a region has been established with 2 endpoint decoders (7.0 and
14.0). Those endpoints share a common switch-decoder in the topology
(3.0). At teardown, 2), decoder14.0 is the first to be removed and hits
the ""out of order reset case"" in the switch decoder. The effect though
is that region3 cleanup is aborted leaving it in-tact and
referencing decoder14.0. At 3) the second attempt to teardown region3
trips over the stale decoder14.0 object which has long since been
deleted.

The fix here is to recognize that the CXL specification places no
mandate on in-order shutdown of switch-decoders, the driver enforces
in-order allocation, and hardware enforces in-order commit. So, rather
than fail and leave objects dangling, always remove them.

In support of making cxl_region_decode_reset() always succeed,
cxl_region_invalidate_memregion() failures are turned into warnings.
Crashing the kernel is ok there since system integrity is at risk if
caches cannot be managed around physical address mutation events like
CXL region destruction.

A new device_for_each_child_reverse_from() is added to cleanup
port->commit_end after all dependent decoders have been disabled. In
other words if decoders are allocated 0->1->2 and disabled 1->2->0 then
port->commit_end only decrements from 2 after 2 has been disabled, and
it decrements all the way to zero since 1 was disabled previously."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

nilfs2: fix potential deadlock with newly created symlinks

Syzbot reported that page_symlink(), called by nilfs_symlink(), triggers
memory reclamation involving the filesystem layer, which can result in
circular lock dependencies among the reader/writer semaphore
nilfs->ns_segctor_sem, s_writers percpu_rwsem (intwrite) and the
fs_reclaim pseudo lock.

This is because after commit 21fc61c73c39 (""don't put symlink bodies in
pagecache into highmem""), the gfp flags of the page cache for symbolic
links are overwritten to GFP_KERNEL via inode_nohighmem().

This is not a problem for symlinks read from the backing device, because
the __GFP_FS flag is dropped after inode_nohighmem() is called.  However,
when a new symlink is created with nilfs_symlink(), the gfp flags remain
overwritten to GFP_KERNEL.  Then, memory allocation called from
page_symlink() etc.  triggers memory reclamation including the FS layer,
which may call nilfs_evict_inode() or nilfs_dirty_inode().  And these can
cause a deadlock if they are called while nilfs->ns_segctor_sem is held:

Fix this issue by dropping the __GFP_FS flag from the page cache GFP flags
of newly created symlinks in the same way that nilfs_new_inode() and
__nilfs_read_inode() do, as a workaround until we adopt nofs allocation
scope consistently or improve the locking constraints."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

nilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of checked flag

Syzbot reported that in directory operations after nilfs2 detects
filesystem corruption and degrades to read-only,
__block_write_begin_int(), which is called to prepare block writes, may
fail the BUG_ON check for accesses exceeding the folio/page size,
triggering a kernel bug.

This was found to be because the ""checked"" flag of a page/folio was not
cleared when it was discarded by nilfs2's own routine, which causes the
sanity check of directory entries to be skipped when the directory
page/folio is reloaded.  So, fix that.

This was necessary when the use of nilfs2's own page discard routine was

trying to bring things back up, and the restart work (queued form
the interrupt handler) trying to bring things down. Eventually
the whole thing blows up.

CVE-2024-50250	2024-11-09T11:15:10.833	2025-10-01T21:16:12.193	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fsdax: dax_unshare_iter needs to copy entire blocks

The code that copies data from srcmap to iomap in dax_unshare_iter is
very very broken, which bfoster's recent fsx changes have exposed.

If the pos and len passed to dax_file_unshare are not aligned to an
fsblock boundary, the iter pos and length in the _iter function will
reflect this unalignment.

dax_iomap_direct_access always returns a pointer to the start of the
kmapped fsdax page, even if its pos argument is in the middle of that
page.  This is catastrophic for data integrity when iter->pos is not
aligned to a page, because daddr/saddr do not point to the same byte in
the file as iter->pos.  Hence we corrupt user data by copying it to the
wrong place.

If iter->pos + iomap_length() in the _iter function not aligned to a
page, then we fail to copy a full block, and only partially populate the
destination block.  This is catastrophic for data confidentiality
because we expose stale pmem contents.

Fix both of these issues by aligning copy_pos/copy_len to a page
boundary (remember, this is fsdax so 1 fsblock == 1 base page) so that
we always copy full blocks.

We're not done yet -- there's no call to invalidate_inode_pages2_range,
so programs that have the file range mmap'd will continue accessing the
old memory mapping after the file metadata updates have completed.

Be careful with the return value -- if the unshare succeeds, we still
need to return the number of bytes that the iomap iter thinks we're
operating on."	7.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

mlxsw: spectrum_ipip: Fix memory leak when changing remote IPv6 address

The device stores IPv6 addresses that are used for encapsulation in
linear memory that is managed by the driver.

Changing the remote address of an ip6gre net device never worked
properly, but since cited commit the following reproducer [1] would
result in a warning [2] and a memory leak [3]. The problem is that the
new remote address is never added by the driver to its hash table (and
therefore the device) and the old address is never removed from it.

Fix by programming the new address when the configuration of the ip6gre
net device changes and removing the old one. If the address did not
change, then the above would result in increasing the reference count of
the address and then decreasing it.

That is because nr_bits will be set as zero in bpf_iter_bits_next()
after all bits have been iterated.

Fix the issue by setting kit->bit to kit->nr_bits instead of setting
kit->nr_bits to zero when the iteration completes in
bpf_iter_bits_next(). In addition, use ""!nr_bits || bits >= nr_bits"" to
check whether the iteration is complete and still use ""nr_bits > 64"" to
indicate whether bits are dynamically allocated. The ""!nr_bits"" check is
necessary because bpf_iter_bits_new() may fail before setting
kit->nr_bits, and this condition will stop the iteration early instead
of accessing the zeroed or freed kit->bits.

Considering the initial value of kit->bits is -1 and the type of
kit->nr_bits is unsigned int, change the type of kit->nr_bits to int.

macsec: Fix use-after-free while sending the offloading packet

KASAN reports the following UAF. The metadata_dst, which is used to
store the SCI value for macsec offload, is already freed by
metadata_dst_free() in macsec_free_netdev(), while driver still use it
for sending the packet.

To fix this issue, dst_release() is used instead to release
metadata_dst. So it is not freed instantly in macsec_free_netdev() if
still referenced by skb.

CVE-2024-50263	2024-11-11T14:15:15.473	2024-12-09T22:15:22.497	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fork: only invoke khugepaged, ksm hooks if no error

There is no reason to invoke these hooks early against an mm that is in an
incomplete state.

The change in commit d24062914837 (""fork: use __mt_dup() to duplicate
maple tree in dup_mmap()"") makes this more pertinent as we may be in a
state where entries in the maple tree are not yet consistent.

Their placement early in dup_mmap() only appears to have been meaningful
for early error checking, and since functionally it'd require a very small
allocation to fail (in practice 'too small to fail') that'd only occur in
the most dire circumstances, meaning the fork would fail or be OOM'd in
any case.

Since both khugepaged and KSM tracking are there to provide optimisations
to memory performance rather than critical functionality, it doesn't
really matter all that much if, under such dire memory pressure, we fail
to register an mm with these.

As a result, we follow the example of commit d2081b2bf819 (""mm:
khugepaged: make khugepaged_enter() void function"") and make ksm_fork() a
void function also.

We only expose the mm to these functions once we are done with them and
only if no error occurred in the fork operation."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-51747	2024-11-11T20:15:19.197	2025-03-10T17:50:49.490	Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. An authenticated Kanboard admin can read and delete arbitrary files from the server. File attachments, that are viewable or downloadable in Kanboard are resolved through its `path` entry in the `project_has_files`  SQLite db. Thus, an attacker who can upload a modified sqlite.db through the dedicated feature, can set arbitrary file links, by abusing path traversals. Once the modified db is uploaded and the project page is accessed, a file download can be triggered and all files, readable in the context of the Kanboard application permissions, can be downloaded. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.42 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2024-51748	2024-11-11T20:15:19.420	2025-03-10T17:47:47.537	Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. An authenticated Kanboard admin can run arbitrary php code on the server in combination with a file write possibility. The user interface language is determined and loaded by the setting `application_language` in the `settings` table. Thus, an attacker who can upload a modified sqlite.db through the dedicated feature, has control over the filepath, which is loaded. Exploiting this vulnerability has one constraint: the attacker must be able to place a file (called translations.php) on the system. However, this is not impossible, think of anonymous FTP server or another application that allows uploading files. Once the attacker has placed its file with the actual php code as the payload, the attacker can craft a sqlite db settings, which uses path traversal to point to the directory, where the `translations.php` file is stored. Then gaining code execution after importing the crafted sqlite.db. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.42 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2024-51992	2024-11-11T20:15:19.647	2024-11-12T13:55:21.227	Orchid is a @laravel package that allows for rapid application development of back-office applications, admin/user panels, and dashboards. This vulnerability is a method exposure issue (CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function) in the Orchid Platform’s asynchronous modal functionality, affecting users of Orchid Platform version 8 through 14.42.x. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to call arbitrary methods within the `Screen` class, leading to potential brute force of database tables, validation checks against user credentials, and disclosure of the server’s real IP address. The issue has been patched in the latest release, version 14.43.0, released on November 6, 2024. Users should upgrade to version 14.43.0 or later to address this vulnerability. If upgrading to version 14.43.0 is not immediately possible, users can mitigate the vulnerability by implementing middleware to intercept and validate requests to asynchronous modal endpoints, allowing only approved methods and parameters.	4.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2024-52286	2024-11-11T20:15:19.867	2025-01-09T15:15:18.347	Stirling-PDF is a locally hosted web application that allows you to perform various operations on PDF files. In affected versions the Merge functionality takes untrusted user input (file name) and uses it directly in the creation of HTML pages allowing any unauthenticated to execute JavaScript code in the context of the user. The issue stems to the code starting at `Line 24` in `src/main/resources/static/js/merge.js`. The file name is directly being input into InnerHTML with no sanitization on the file name, allowing a malicious user to be able to upload files with names containing HTML tags. As HTML tags can include JavaScript code, this can be used to execute JavaScript code in the context of the user. This is a self-injection style attack and relies on a user uploading the malicious file themselves and it impact only them, not other users. A user might be social engineered into running this to launch a phishing attack. Nevertheless, this breaks the expected security restrictions in place by the application. This issue has been addressed in version 0.32.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.					
CVE-2024-52288	2024-11-11T20:15:20.013	2024-11-12T13:55:21.227	libosdp is an implementation of IEC 60839-11-5 OSDP (Open Supervised Device Protocol) and provides a C library with support for C++, Rust and Python3. In affected versions an unexpected `REPLY_CCRYPT` or `REPLY_RMAC_I` may be introduced into an active stream when they should not be. Once RMAC_I message can be sent during a session, attacker with MITM access to the communication may intercept the original RMAC_I reply and save it. While the session continues, the attacker will record all of the replies and save them, till capturing the message to be replied (can be detected by ID, length or time based on inspection of visual activity next to the reader) Once attacker captures a session with the message to be replayed, he stops resetting the connection and waits for signal to perform the replay to of the PD to CP message (ex: by signaling remotely to the MIMT device or setting a specific timing). In order to replay, the attacker will craft a specific RMAC_I message in the proper seq of the execution, which will result in reverting the RMAC to the beginning of the session. At that phase - attacker can replay all the messages from the beginning of the session. This issue has been addressed in commit `298576d9` which is included in release version 3.0.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	5.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

Due to missing validation checks for KVM-compatible templates in CloudStack 4.0.0 through 4.18.2.4 and 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.1.2, an attacker that can register templates, can use them to deploy malicious instances on KVM-based environments and exploit this to gain access to the host filesystems that could result in the compromise of resource integrity and confidentiality, data loss, denial of service, and availability of KVM-based infrastructure managed by CloudStack.


Users are recommended to upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.18.2.5 or 4.19.1.3, or later, which addresses this issue. 

Additionally, all user-registered KVM-compatible templates can be scanned and checked that they are flat files that should not be using any additional or unnecessary features. For example, operators can run the following command on their file-based primary storage(s) and inspect the output. An empty output for the disk being validated means it has no references to the host filesystems; on the other hand, if the output for the disk being validated is not empty, it might indicate a compromised disk. However, bear in mind that (i) volumes created from templates will have references for the templates at first and (ii) volumes can be consolidated while migrating, losing their references to the templates. Therefore, the command execution for the primary storages can show both false positives and false negatives.


for file in $(find /path/to/storage/ -type f -regex [a-f0-9\-]*.*); do echo ""Retrieving file [$file] info. If the output is not empty, that might indicate a compromised disk; check it carefully.""; qemu-img info -U $file | grep file: ; printf ""\n\n""; done
For checking the whole template/volume features of each disk, operators can run the following command:

CVE-2024-52010	2024-11-12T17:15:10.370	2024-11-21T17:15:23.350	Zoraxy is a general purpose HTTP reverse proxy and forwarding tool. A command injection vulnerability in the Web SSH feature allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root on the host. Zoraxy has a Web SSH terminal feature that allows authenticated users to connect to SSH servers from their browsers. In HandleCreateProxySession the request to create an SSH session is handled. An attacker can exploit the username variable to escape from the bash command and inject arbitrary commands into sshCommand. This is possible, because, unlike hostname and port, the username is not validated or sanitized.

CVE-2024-4741	2024-11-13T11:15:04.480	2024-11-13T17:01:16.850	"Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_free_buffers may cause
memory to be accessed that was previously freed in some situations

Impact summary: A use after free can have a range of potential consequences such
as the corruption of valid data, crashes or execution of arbitrary code.
However, only applications that directly call the SSL_free_buffers function are
affected by this issue. Applications that do not call this function are not
vulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by
applications.

The SSL_free_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used
when processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected
to succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have
been identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.

The first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the
network and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived.
In this case calling SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though a record has only
been partially processed and the buffer is still in use.

The second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has
been received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of
this data. Again a call to SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though the buffer
is still in use.

While these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a
malicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs.
We are not aware of this issue being actively exploited.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue."	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-10976	2024-11-14T13:15:03.793	2025-05-09T20:15:37.933	Incomplete tracking in PostgreSQL of tables with row security allows a reused query to view or change different rows from those intended.  CVE-2023-2455 and CVE-2016-2193 fixed most interaction between row security and user ID changes.  They missed cases where a subquery, WITH query, security invoker view, or SQL-language function references a table with a row-level security policy.  This has the same consequences as the two earlier CVEs.  That is to say, it leads to potentially incorrect policies being applied in cases where role-specific policies are used and a given query is planned under one role and then executed under other roles.  This scenario can happen under security definer functions or when a common user and query is planned initially and then re-used across multiple SET ROLEs.  Applying an incorrect policy may permit a user to complete otherwise-forbidden reads and modifications.  This affects only databases that have used CREATE POLICY to define a row security policy.  An attacker must tailor an attack to a particular application's pattern of query plan reuse, user ID changes, and role-specific row security policies.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.1, 16.5, 15.9, 14.14, 13.17, and 12.21 are affected.	4.2	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

For example, a man-in-the-middle attacker could send a long error message that a human or screen-scraper user of psql mistakes for valid query results.  This is probably not a concern for clients where the user interface unambiguously indicates the boundary between one error message and other text.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.1, 16.5, 15.9, 14.14, 13.17, and 12.21 are affected.	3.1	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N		
CVE-2024-10978	2024-11-14T13:15:04.217	2025-02-20T15:41:14.847	Incorrect privilege assignment in PostgreSQL allows a less-privileged application user to view or change different rows from those intended.  An attack requires the application to use SET ROLE, SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION, or an equivalent feature.  The problem arises when an application query uses parameters from the attacker or conveys query results to the attacker.  If that query reacts to current_setting('role') or the current user ID, it may modify or return data as though the session had not used SET ROLE or SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION.  The attacker does not control which incorrect user ID applies.  Query text from less-privileged sources is not a concern here, because SET ROLE and SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION are not sandboxes for unvetted queries.

Developers connect to remote codespaces through an SSH server running within the devcontainer, which is generally provided through the [default devcontainer image]( https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-... https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers#using-the-default-dev-container-configuration) . GitHub CLI [retrieves SSH connection details]( https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/30066b0042d0c5928d959e288144300cb28196c9/internal/codespaces/rpc/inv... https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/30066b0042d0c5928d959e288144300cb28196c9/internal/codespaces/rpc/invoker.go#L230-L244 ), such as remote username, which is used in [executing `ssh` commands]( https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/e356c69a6f0125cfaac782c35acf77314f18908d/pkg/cmd/codespace/ssh.go#L2... https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/e356c69a6f0125cfaac782c35acf77314f18908d/pkg/cmd/codespace/ssh.go#L263 ) for `gh codespace ssh` or `gh codespace logs` commands.

This exploit occurs when a malicious third-party devcontainer contains a modified SSH server that injects `ssh` arguments within the SSH connection details. `gh codespace ssh` and `gh codespace logs` commands could execute arbitrary code on the user's workstation if the remote username contains something like `-oProxyCommand=""echo hacked"" #`.  The `-oProxyCommand` flag causes `ssh` to execute the provided command while `#` shell comment causes any other `ssh` arguments to be ignored.

In `2.62.0`, the remote username information is being validated before being used."	8.0	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2024-37155	2024-11-18T15:15:06.210	2025-05-22T15:50:04.340	OpenCTI is an open source platform allowing organizations to manage their cyber threat intelligence knowledge and observables. Prior to version 6.1.9, the regex validation used to prevent Introspection queries can be bypassed by removing the extra whitespace, carriage return, and line feed characters from the query. GraphQL Queries in OpenCTI can be validated using the `secureIntrospectionPlugin`. The regex check in the plkugin can be bypassed by removing the carriage return and line feed characters (`\r\n`).  Running a curl command against a local instance of OpenCTI will result in a limited error message. By running the same Introspection query without the `\r\n` characters, the unauthenticated user is able to successfully run a full Introspection query. Bypassing this restriction allows the attacker to gather a wealth of information about the GraphQL endpoint functionality that can be used to perform actions and/or read data without authorization.  These queries can also be weaponized to conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if sent repeatedly. Users should upgrade to version 6.1.9 to receive a patch for the issue.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L

This was caused by adding an entry to a cache on each request, due to the building of each MatchInfoError producing a unique cache entry. An attacker may be able to exhaust the memory resources of a server by sending a substantial number (100,000s to millions) of such requests. Those who use any middlewares with aiohttp.web should upgrade to version 3.10.11 to receive a patch.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-52304	2024-11-18T21:15:06.500	2025-08-15T17:36:18.507	aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. Prior to version 3.10.11, the Python parser parses newlines in chunk extensions incorrectly which can lead to request smuggling vulnerabilities under certain conditions. If a pure Python version of aiohttp is installed (i.e. without the usual C extensions) or `AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS` is enabled, then an attacker may be able to execute a request smuggling attack to bypass certain firewalls or proxy protections. Version 3.10.11 fixes the issue.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2024-52506	2024-11-18T21:15:06.633	2025-09-23T19:15:38.537	"Graylog is a free and open log management platform. The reporting functionality in Graylog allows the creation and scheduling of reports which contain dashboard widgets displaying individual log messages or metrics aggregated from fields of multiple log messages. This functionality, as included in Graylog 6.1.0 & 6.1.1, is vulnerable to information leakage triggered by multiple concurrent report rendering requests from authorized users. When multiple report renderings are requested at the same start time, the headless browser instance used to render the PDF will be reused. Depending on the timing, either a check for the browser instance ""freshness"" hits, resulting in an error instead of the report being returned, or one of the concurrent report rendering requests ""wins"" and this report is returned for all report rendering requests that do not return an error. This might lead to one user getting the report of a different user, potentially leaking indexed log messages or aggregated data that this user normally has no access to. This problem is fixed in Graylog 6.1.2. There is no known workaround besides disabling the reporting functionality."

signal: restore the override_rlimit logic

Prior to commit d64696905554 (""Reimplement RLIMIT_SIGPENDING on top of
ucounts"") UCOUNT_RLIMIT_SIGPENDING rlimit was not enforced for a class of
signals.  However now it's enforced unconditionally, even if
override_rlimit is set.  This behavior change caused production issues.  

For example, if the limit is reached and a process receives a SIGSEGV
signal, sigqueue_alloc fails to allocate the necessary resources for the
signal delivery, preventing the signal from being delivered with siginfo. 
This prevents the process from correctly identifying the fault address and
handling the error.  From the user-space perspective, applications are
unaware that the limit has been reached and that the siginfo is
effectively 'corrupted'.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior and
crashes, as we observed with java applications.

Fix this by passing override_rlimit into inc_rlimit_get_ucounts() and skip
the comparison to max there if override_rlimit is set.  This effectively
restores the old behavior."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

btrfs: reinitialize delayed ref list after deleting it from the list

At insert_delayed_ref() if we need to update the action of an existing

ref_add_list using list_del(), which leaves the ref's add_list member

list to LIST_POISON1 and LIST_POISON2, respectively.

If later we end up calling drop_delayed_ref() against the ref, which can
happen during merging or when destroying delayed refs due to a transaction
abort, we can trigger a crash since at drop_delayed_ref() we call
list_empty() against the ref's add_list, which returns false since
the list was not reinitialized after the list_del() and as a consequence
we call list_del() again at drop_delayed_ref(). This results in an
invalid list access since the next and prev members are set to poison

arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps

The logic for handling SVE traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE state
incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having
TIF_SVE set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state
is stale (e.g. with SVE traps enabled). This has been observed to result
in warnings from do_sve_acc() where SVE traps are not expected while
TIF_SVE is set:

|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
|                 WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/000000000000511e9a060ce5a45c@google.com/

The race can occur when the SVE trap handler is preempted before and
after manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE state, starting and ending on
the same CPU, e.g.

| {
|         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SVE clear, SVE traps enabled
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is 0.

|
|         ...
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1.
|         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.

| }

Fix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set
by calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU
state. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the

Out-of-bounds access occurs if the fast device is expanded unexpectedly

expanding the fast device requires reloading the cache table for
cache_create to allocate new in-core data structures that fit the new
size, and the check in cache_preresume is not performed during the
first resume, leading to the issue.

dmsetup create corig --table ""0 524288 linear /dev/sdc 262144""
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/cmeta bs=4k count=1 oflag=direct

2. load a cache table of 512 cache blocks, and deliberately expand the
   fast device before resuming the cache, making the in-core data
   structures inadequate.

This issue was also reported by syzbot.

It can be reproduced by following these steps(more details [1]):
1. Obtain more than 32 inputs that have similar hashes, which ends with the
   pattern '0xxxxxxxe6'.
2. Reboot and add the keys obtained in step 1.

The reproducer demonstrates how this issue happened:
1. In the search_nested_keyrings function, when it iterates through the
   slots in a node(below tag ascend_to_node), if the slot pointer is meta
   and node->back_pointer != NULL(it means a root), it will proceed to
   descend_to_node. However, there is an exception. If node is the root,
   and one of the slots points to a shortcut, it will be treated as a
   keyring.
2. Whether the ptr is keyring decided by keyring_ptr_is_keyring function.
   However, KEYRING_PTR_SUBTYPE is 0x2UL, the same as
   ASSOC_ARRAY_PTR_SUBTYPE_MASK.
3. When 32 keys with the similar hashes are added to the tree, the ROOT
   has keys with hashes that are not similar (e.g. slot 0) and it splits
   NODE A without using a shortcut. When NODE A is filled with keys that
   all hashes are xxe6, the keys are similar, NODE A will split with a
   shortcut. Finally, it forms the tree as shown below, where slot 6 points
   to a shortcut.

                      NODE A
              +------>+---+
      ROOT    |       | 0 | xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
 xxxx | 0 | shortcut  :   : xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
 xxe6 :   :   |       |   | xxe6
      +---+   |       +---+
      | 6 |---+       :   : xxe6
      +---+           +---+
 xxe6 :   :           | f | xxe6
      +---+           +---+
 xxe6 | f |
      +---+

4. As mentioned above, If a slot(slot 6) of the root points to a shortcut,
   it may be mistakenly transferred to a key*, leading to a read
   out-of-bounds read.

To fix this issue, one should jump to descend_to_node if the ptr is a
shortcut, regardless of whether the node is root or not.

Apache Kafka Clients accept configuration data for customizing behavior, and includes ConfigProvider plugins in order to manipulate these configurations. Apache Kafka also provides FileConfigProvider, DirectoryConfigProvider, and EnvVarConfigProvider implementations which include the ability to read from disk or environment variables.
In applications where Apache Kafka Clients configurations can be specified by an untrusted party, attackers may use these ConfigProviders to read arbitrary contents of the disk and environment variables.

In particular, this flaw may be used in Apache Kafka Connect to escalate from REST API access to filesystem/environment access, which may be undesirable in certain environments, including SaaS products.
This issue affects Apache Kafka Clients: from 2.3.0 through 3.5.2, 3.6.2, 3.7.0.


Users with affected applications are recommended to upgrade kafka-clients to version >=3.8.0, and set the JVM system property ""org.apache.kafka.automatic.config.providers=none"".
Users of Kafka Connect with one of the listed ConfigProvider implementations specified in their worker config are also recommended to add appropriate ""allowlist.pattern"" and ""allowed.paths"" to restrict their operation to appropriate bounds.


For users of Kafka Clients or Kafka Connect in environments that trust users with disk and environment variable access, it is not recommended to set the system property.

It is also needed for High Availability function of the Versa Director. The default configuration has a common password across all instances of Versa Director. By default, Versa Director configures Postgres to listen on all network interfaces. This combination allows an unauthenticated attacker to access and administer the database or read local filesystem contents to escalate privileges on the system. 

Exploitation Status:
Versa Networks is not aware of this exploitation in any production systems. A proof of concept exists in the lab environment.

Workarounds or Mitigation:
Starting with the latest 22.1.4 version of Versa Director, the software will automatically restrict access to the Postgres and HA ports to only the local and peer Versa Directors. For older releases, Versa recommends performing manual hardening of HA ports. Please refer to the following link for the steps https://docs.versa-networks.com/Solutions/System_Hardening/Perform_Manual_Hardening_for_Versa_Director#Secure_HA_Ports  

This vulnerability is not exploitable on Versa Directors if published Firewall guidelines are implemented. We have validated that no Versa-hosted head ends have been affected by this vulnerability. All Versa-hosted head ends are patched and hardened. 

Please contact Versa Technical Support or Versa account team for any further assistance.

resource,kexec: walk_system_ram_res_rev must retain resource flags

walk_system_ram_res_rev() erroneously discards resource flags when passing
the information to the callback.

This causes systems with IORESOURCE_SYSRAM_DRIVER_MANAGED memory to have
these resources selected during kexec to store kexec buffers if that
memory happens to be at placed above normal system ram.

This leads to undefined behavior after reboot.  If the kexec buffer is
never touched, nothing happens.  If the kexec buffer is touched, it could
lead to a crash (like below) or undefined behavior.

Tested on a system with CXL memory expanders with driver managed memory,
TPM enabled, and CONFIG_IMA_KEXEC=y.  Adding printk's showed the flags
were being discarded and as a result the check for
IORESOURCE_SYSRAM_DRIVER_MANAGED passes.

net/sched: sch_api: fix xa_insert() error path in tcf_block_get_ext()

This command:

$ tc qdisc replace dev eth0 ingress_block 1 egress_block 1 clsact
Error: block dev insert failed: -EBUSY.

fails because user space requests the same block index to be set for
both ingress and egress.

[ side note, I don't think it even failed prior to commit 913b47d3424e
  (""net/sched: Introduce tc block netdev tracking infra""), because this
  is a command from an old set of notes of mine which used to work, but
  alas, I did not scientifically bisect this ]

The problem is not that it fails, but rather, that the second time
around, it fails differently (and irrecoverably):

$ tc qdisc replace dev eth0 ingress_block 1 egress_block 1 clsact
Error: dsa_core: Flow block cb is busy.

[ another note: the extack is added by me for illustration purposes.
  the context of the problem is that clsact_init() obtains the same
  &q->ingress_block pointer as &q->egress_block, and since we call
  tcf_block_get_ext() on both of them, ""dev"" will be added to the
  block->ports xarray twice, thus failing the operation: once through
  the ingress block pointer, and once again through the egress block
  pointer. the problem itself is that when xa_insert() fails, we have
  emitted a FLOW_BLOCK_BIND command through ndo_setup_tc(), but the
  offload never sees a corresponding FLOW_BLOCK_UNBIND. ]

Even correcting the bad user input, we still cannot recover:

$ tc qdisc replace dev swp3 ingress_block 1 egress_block 2 clsact
Error: dsa_core: Flow block cb is busy.

Basically the only way to recover is to reboot the system, or unbind and
rebind the net device driver.

To fix the bug, we need to fill the correct error teardown path which
was missed during code movement, and call tcf_block_offload_unbind()
when xa_insert() fails.

[ last note, fundamentally I blame the label naming convention in
  tcf_block_get_ext() for the bug. The labels should be named after what
  they do, not after the error path that jumps to them. This way, it is
  obviously wrong that two labels pointing to the same code mean
  something is wrong, and checking the code correctness at the goto site
  is also easier ]"	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

io_uring/rw: fix missing NOWAIT check for O_DIRECT start write

When io_uring starts a write, it'll call kiocb_start_write() to bump the

write is in-flight. The freeze side will grab that rwsem for writing,
excluding any new writers from happening and waiting for existing writes
to finish. But io_uring unconditionally uses kiocb_start_write(), which
will block if someone is currently attempting to freeze the mount point.

complete, but the previous writes cannot complete, as the task that is

where IOCB_NOWAIT would always be set, this returns -EAGAIN which will
have io_uring core issue a blocking attempt of the write. That will in

net/sched: stop qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog on TC_H_ROOT

In qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog, Qdiscs with major handle ffff: are assumed
to be either root or ingress. This assumption is bogus since it's valid
to create egress qdiscs with major handle ffff:
Budimir Markovic found that for qdiscs like DRR that maintain an active
class list, it will cause a UAF with a dangling class pointer.

In 066a3b5b2346, the concern was to avoid iterating over the ingress
qdisc since its parent is itself. The proper fix is to stop when parent
TC_H_ROOT is reached because the only way to retrieve ingress is when a
hierarchy which does not contain a ffff: major handle call into
qdisc_lookup with TC_H_MAJ(TC_H_ROOT).

In the scenario where major ffff: is an egress qdisc in any of the tree
levels, the updates will also propagate to TC_H_ROOT, which then the
iteration must stop.

CVE-2024-53058	2024-11-19T18:15:25.767	2025-10-01T21:16:23.277	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: stmmac: TSO: Fix unbalanced DMA map/unmap for non-paged SKB data

In case the non-paged data of a SKB carries protocol header and protocol
payload to be transmitted on a certain platform that the DMA AXI address
width is configured to 40-bit/48-bit, or the size of the non-paged data
is bigger than TSO_MAX_BUFF_SIZE on a certain platform that the DMA AXI
address width is configured to 32-bit, then this SKB requires at least
two DMA transmit descriptors to serve it.

For example, three descriptors are allocated to split one DMA buffer
mapped from one piece of non-paged data:
    dma_desc[N + 0],
    dma_desc[N + 1],
    dma_desc[N + 2].
Then three elements of tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[] will be allocated to hold
extra information to be reused in stmmac_tx_clean():
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0],
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1],
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].
Now we focus on tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf, which is the DMA buffer
address returned by DMA mapping call. stmmac_tx_clean() will try to
unmap the DMA buffer _ONLY_IF_ tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf
is a valid buffer address.

The expected behavior that saves DMA buffer address of this non-paged
data to tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf is:
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf = NULL;
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1].buf = NULL;
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].buf = dma_map_single();
Unfortunately, the current code misbehaves like this:
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf = dma_map_single();
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1].buf = NULL;
    tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].buf = NULL;

On the stmmac_tx_clean() side, when dma_desc[N + 0] is closed by the
DMA engine, tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf is a valid buffer address
obviously, then the DMA buffer will be unmapped immediately.
There may be a rare case that the DMA engine does not finish the
pending dma_desc[N + 1], dma_desc[N + 2] yet. Now things will go
horribly wrong, DMA is going to access a unmapped/unreferenced memory
region, corrupted data will be transmited or iommu fault will be
triggered :(

In contrast, the for-loop that maps SKB fragments behaves perfectly
as expected, and that is how the driver should do for both non-paged
data and paged frags actually.

This patch corrects DMA map/unmap sequences by fixing the array index
for tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf when assigning DMA buffer address.

media: dvbdev: prevent the risk of out of memory access

The dvbdev contains a static variable used to store dvb minors.

The behavior of it depends if CONFIG_DVB_DYNAMIC_MINORS is set
or not. When not set, dvb_register_device() won't check for
boundaries, as it will rely that a previous call to
dvb_register_adapter() would already be enforcing it.

On a similar way, dvb_device_open() uses the assumption
that the register functions already did the needed checks.

This can be fragile if some device ends using different
calls. This also generate warnings on static check analysers
like Coverity.

So, add explicit guards to prevent potential risk of OOM issues."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

idpf: fix idpf_vc_core_init error path

In an event where the platform running the device control plane
is rebooted, reset is detected on the driver. It releases
all the resources and waits for the reset to complete. Once the
reset is done, it tries to build the resources back. At this
time if the device control plane is not yet started, then
the driver timeouts on the virtchnl message and retries to
establish the mailbox again.

In the retry flow, mailbox is deinitialized but the mailbox
workqueue is still alive and polling for the mailbox message.
This results in accessing the released control queue leading to
null-ptr-deref. Fix it by unrolling the work queue cancellation

mm/slab: fix warning caused by duplicate kmem_cache creation in kmem_buckets_create

Commit b035f5a6d852 (""mm: slab: reduce the kmalloc() minimum alignment
if DMA bouncing possible"") reduced ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN to 8 on arm64.
However, with KASAN_HW_TAGS enabled, arch_slab_minalign() becomes 16.
This causes kmalloc_caches[*][8] to be aliased to kmalloc_caches[*][16],
resulting in kmem_buckets_create() attempting to create a kmem_cache for
size 16 twice. This duplication triggers warnings on boot:

drm/panthor: Be stricter about IO mapping flags

The current panthor_device_mmap_io() implementation has two issues:

1. For mapping DRM_PANTHOR_USER_FLUSH_ID_MMIO_OFFSET,
   panthor_device_mmap_io() bails if VM_WRITE is set, but does not clear
   VM_MAYWRITE. That means userspace can use mprotect() to make the mapping
   writable later on. This is a classic Linux driver gotcha.
   I don't think this actually has any impact in practice:
   When the GPU is powered, writes to the FLUSH_ID seem to be ignored; and
   when the GPU is not powered, the dummy_latest_flush page provided by the
   driver is deliberately designed to not do any flushes, so the only thing
   writing to the dummy_latest_flush could achieve would be to make *more*
   flushes happen.

2. panthor_device_mmap_io() does not block MAP_PRIVATE mappings (which are
   mappings without the VM_SHARED flag).
   MAP_PRIVATE in combination with VM_MAYWRITE indicates that the VMA has
   copy-on-write semantics, which for VM_PFNMAP are semi-supported but
   fairly cursed.
   In particular, in such a mapping, the driver can only install PTEs
   during mmap() by calling remap_pfn_range() (because remap_pfn_range()
   wants to **store the physical address of the mapped physical memory into
   the vm_pgoff of the VMA**); installing PTEs later on with a fault
   handler (as panthor does) is not supported in private mappings, and so
   if you try to fault in such a mapping, vmf_insert_pfn_prot() splats when
   it hits a BUG() check.

Fix it by clearing the VM_MAYWRITE flag (userspace writing to the FLUSH_ID
doesn't make sense) and requiring VM_SHARED (copy-on-write semantics for
the FLUSH_ID don't make sense).

Reproducers for both scenarios are in the notes of my patch on the mailing
list; I tested that these bugs exist on a Rock 5B machine.

Note that I only compile-tested the patch, I haven't tested it; I don't

mm/thp: fix deferred split unqueue naming and locking

Recent changes are putting more pressure on THP deferred split queues:
under load revealing long-standing races, causing list_del corruptions,
""Bad page state""s and worse (I keep BUGs in both of those, so usually
don't get to see how badly they end up without).  The relevant recent
changes being 6.8's mTHP, 6.10's mTHP swapout, and 6.12's mTHP swapin,
improved swap allocation, and underused THP splitting.

Before fixing locking: rename misleading folio_undo_large_rmappable(),
which does not undo large_rmappable, to folio_unqueue_deferred_split(),
which is what it does.  But that and its out-of-line __callee are mm
internals of very limited usability: add comment and WARN_ON_ONCEs to
check usage; and return a bool to say if a deferred split was unqueued,
which can then be used in WARN_ON_ONCEs around safety checks (sparing
callers the arcane conditionals in __folio_unqueue_deferred_split()).

Just omit the folio_unqueue_deferred_split() from free_unref_folios(), all
of whose callers now call it beforehand (and if any forget then bad_page()
will tell) - except for its caller put_pages_list(), which itself no
longer has any callers (and will be deleted separately).

Swapout: mem_cgroup_swapout() has been resetting folio->memcg_data 0
without checking and unqueueing a THP folio from deferred split list;
which is unfortunate, since the split_queue_lock depends on the memcg
(when memcg is enabled); so swapout has been unqueueing such THPs later,
when freeing the folio, using the pgdat's lock instead: potentially
corrupting the memcg's list.  __remove_mapping() has frozen refcount to 0
here, so no problem with calling folio_unqueue_deferred_split() before
resetting memcg_data.

That goes back to 5.4 commit 87eaceb3faa5 (""mm: thp: make deferred split
shrinker memcg aware""): which included a check on swapcache before adding
to deferred queue, but no check on deferred queue before adding THP to
swapcache.  That worked fine with the usual sequence of events in reclaim
(though there were a couple of rare ways in which a THP on deferred queue
could have been swapped out), but 6.12 commit dafff3f4c850 (""mm: split
underused THPs"") avoids splitting underused THPs in reclaim, which makes
swapcache THPs on deferred queue commonplace.

Keep the check on swapcache before adding to deferred queue?  Yes: it is
no longer essential, but preserves the existing behaviour, and is likely
to be a worthwhile optimization (vmstat showed much more traffic on the
queue under swapping load if the check was removed); update its comment.

Memcg-v1 move (deprecated): mem_cgroup_move_account() has been changing
folio->memcg_data without checking and unqueueing a THP folio from the
deferred list, sometimes corrupting ""from"" memcg's list, like swapout. 
Refcount is non-zero here, so folio_unqueue_deferred_split() can only be
used in a WARN_ON_ONCE to validate the fix, which must be done earlier:
mem_cgroup_move_charge_pte_range() first try to split the THP (splitting
of course unqueues), or skip it if that fails.  Not ideal, but moving
charge has been requested, and khugepaged should repair the THP later:
nobody wants new custom unqueueing code just for this deprecated case.

The 87eaceb3faa5 commit did have the code to move from one deferred list
to another (but was not conscious of its unsafety while refcount non-0);
but that was removed by 5.6 commit fac0516b5534 (""mm: thp: don't need care
deferred split queue in memcg charge move path""), which argued that the
existence of a PMD mapping guarantees that the THP cannot be on a deferred
list.  As above, false in rare cases, and now commonly false.

Backport to 6.11 should be straightforward.  Earlier backports must take
care that other _deferred_list fixes and dependencies are included.  There
is not a strong case for backports, but they can fix cornercases."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

i40e: fix race condition by adding filter's intermediate sync state

Fix a race condition in the i40e driver that leads to MAC/VLAN filters
becoming corrupted and leaking. Address the issue that occurs under
heavy load when multiple threads are concurrently modifying MAC/VLAN
filters by setting mac and port VLAN.

1. Thread T0 allocates a filter in i40e_add_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_port_vlan().
2. Thread T1 concurrently frees the filter in __i40e_del_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac().
3. Subsequently, i40e_service_task() calls i40e_sync_vsi_filters(), which
        refers to the already freed filter memory, causing corruption.

Reproduction steps:
1. Spawn multiple VFs.
2. Apply a concurrent heavy load by running parallel operations to change
        MAC addresses on the VFs and change port VLANs on the host.
3. Observe errors in dmesg:
""Error I40E_AQ_RC_ENOSPC adding RX filters on VF XX,
	please set promiscuous on manually for VF XX"".

Exact code for stable reproduction Intel can't open-source now.

The fix involves implementing a new intermediate filter state,

CVE-2024-52595	2024-11-19T22:15:21.120	2024-11-25T14:27:38.087	lxml_html_clean is a project for HTML cleaning functionalities copied from `lxml.html.clean`. Prior to version 0.4.0, the HTML Parser in lxml does not properly handle context-switching for special HTML tags such as `<svg>`, `<math>` and `<noscript>`. This behavior deviates from how web browsers parse and interpret such tags. Specifically, content in CSS comments is ignored by lxml_html_clean but may be interpreted differently by web browsers, enabling malicious scripts to bypass the cleaning process. This vulnerability could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, compromising the security of users relying on lxml_html_clean in default configuration for sanitizing untrusted HTML content. Users employing the HTML cleaner in a security-sensitive context should upgrade to lxml 0.4.0, which addresses this issue. As a temporary mitigation, users can configure lxml_html_clean with the following settings to prevent the exploitation of this vulnerability. Via `remove_tags`, one may specify tags to remove - their content is moved to their parents' tags. Via `kill_tags`, one may specify tags to be removed completely. Via `allow_tags`, one may restrict the set of permissible tags, excluding context-switching tags like `<svg>`, `<math>` and `<noscript>`.	7.7	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H

CVE-2024-52598	2024-11-20T15:15:11.667	2025-08-04T15:24:02.550	2FAuth is a web app to manage Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) accounts and generate their security codes. Two interconnected vulnerabilities exist in version 5.4.1 a SSRF and URI validation bypass issue. The endpoint at POST /api/v1/twofaccounts/preview allows setting a remote URI to retrieve the image of a 2fa site. By abusing this functionality, it is possible to force the application to make a GET request to an arbitrary URL, whose content will be stored in an image file in the server if it looks like an image. Additionally, the library does some basic validation on the URI, attempting to filter our URIs which do not have an image extension. However, this can be easily bypassed by appending the string `#.svg` to the URI. The combination of these two issues allows an attacker to retrieve URIs accessible from the application, as long as their content type is text based. If not, the request is still sent, but the response is not reflected to the attacker. Version 5.4.1 fixes the issues.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue exists through the Briefcase module due to improper sanitization of file content by the OnlyOffice formatter. This occurs when the victim opens a crafted URL pointing to a shared folder containing a malicious file uploaded by the attacker. The vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's session.	5.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N		
CVE-2024-45510	2024-11-20T20:15:18.943	2025-06-11T19:13:10.833	An issue was discovered in Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) through 10.0. Zimbra Webmail (Modern UI) is vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack due to improper sanitization of user input. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into specific fields of an e-mail message. When the victim adds the attacker to their contacts, the malicious code is stored and executed when viewing the contact list. This can lead to unauthorized actions such as arbitrary mail sending, mailbox exfiltration, profile picture alteration, and other malicious actions. Proper sanitization and escaping of input fields are necessary to mitigate this vulnerability.	5.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N		
CVE-2024-48981	2024-11-20T20:15:19.097	2024-11-25T22:15:13.517	An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0. During processing of HCI packets, the software dynamically determines the length of the packet header by looking up the identifying first byte and matching it against a table of possible lengths. The initial parsing function, hciTrSerialRxIncoming does not drop packets with invalid identifiers but also does not set a safe default for the length of unknown packets' headers, leading to a buffer overflow. This can be leveraged into an arbitrary write by an attacker. It is possible to overwrite the pointer to a not-yet-allocated buffer that is supposed to receive the contents of the packet body. One can then overwrite the state variable used by the function to determine which state of packet parsing is currently occurring. Because the buffer is allocated when the last byte of the header has been copied, the combination of having a bad header length variable that will never match the counter variable and being able to overwrite the state variable with the resulting buffer overflow can be used to advance the function to the next step while skipping the buffer allocation and resulting pointer write. The next 16 bytes from the packet body are then written wherever the corrupted data pointer is pointing.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2024-48983	2024-11-20T20:15:19.183	2024-11-25T21:15:17.750	An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0. During processing of HCI packets, the software dynamically determines the length of the packet data by reading 2 bytes from the packet header. A buffer is then allocated to contain the entire packet, the size of which is calculated as the length of the packet body determined earlier plus the header length. WsfMsgAlloc then increments this again by sizeof(wsfMsg_t). This may cause an integer overflow that results in the buffer being significantly too small to contain the entire packet. This may cause a buffer overflow of up to 65 KB . This bug is trivial to exploit for a denial of service but can generally not be exploited further because the exploitable buffer is dynamically allocated.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2024-48985	2024-11-20T20:15:19.270	2024-11-25T22:15:14.790	An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0. During processing of HCI packets, the software dynamically determines the length of the packet data by reading 2 bytes from the packet data. A buffer is then allocated to contain the entire packet, the size of which is calculated as the length of the packet body determined earlier and the header length. If the allocate fails because the specified packet is too large, no exception handling occurs and hciTrSerialRxIncoming continues to write bytes into the 4-byte large temporary header buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. This can be leveraged into an arbitrary write by an attacker. It is possible to overwrite the pointer to the buffer that is supposed to receive the contents of the packet body but which couldn't be allocated. One can then overwrite the state variable used by the function to determine which step of the parsing process is currently being executed. This advances the function to the next state, where it proceeds to copy data to that arbitrary location. The packet body is then written wherever the corrupted data pointer is pointing.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

CVE-2024-48982	2024-11-20T21:15:07.830	2024-11-25T21:15:17.023	An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0. Its hci parsing software dynamically determines the length of certain hci packets by reading a byte from its header. This value is assumed to be greater than or equal to 3, but the software doesn't ensure that this is the case. Supplying a length less than 3 leads to a buffer overflow in a buffer that is allocated later. It is simultaneously possible to cause another integer overflow by supplying large length values because the provided length value is increased by a few bytes to account for additional information that is supposed to be stored there. This bug is trivial to exploit for a denial of service but is not certain to suffice to bring the system down and can generally not be exploited further because the exploitable buffer is dynamically allocated.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2024-48984	2024-11-20T21:15:07.920	2025-09-24T19:09:25.543	An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0. When parsing hci reports, the hci parsing software dynamically determines the length of a list of reports by reading a byte from an input stream. It then fetches the length of the first report, uses it to calculate the beginning of the second report, etc. In doing this, it tracks the largest report so it can later allocate a buffer that fits every individual report (but only one at a time). It does not, however, validate that these addresses are all contained within the buffer passed to hciEvtProcessLeExtAdvReport. It is then possible, though unlikely, that the buffer designated to hold the reports is allocated in such a way that one of these out-of-bounds length fields is contained within the new buffer. When the (n-1)th report is copied, it overwrites the length field of the nth report. This now corrupted length field is then used for a memcpy into the new buffer, which may lead to a buffer overflow.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Its hci parsing software dynamically determines the length of certain hci packets by reading a byte from its header. Certain events cause a callback, the logic for which allocates a buffer (the length of which is determined by looking up the event type in a table). The subsequent write operation, however, copies the amount of data specified in the packet header, which may lead to a buffer overflow. This bug is trivial to exploit for a denial of service but is not certain to suffice to bring the system down and can generally not be exploited further because the exploitable buffer is dynamically allocated.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-52581	2024-11-20T21:15:08.320	2024-11-25T14:15:07.077	Litestar is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework. Prior to version 2.13.0, the multipart form parser shipped with litestar expects the entire request body as a single byte string and there is no default limit for the total size of the request body. This allows an attacker to upload arbitrary large files wrapped in a `multipart/form-data` request and cause excessive memory consumption on the server. The multipart form parser in affected versions is vulnerable to this type of attack by design. The public method signature as well as its implementation both expect the entire request body to be available as a single byte string. It is not possible to accept large file uploads in a safe way using this parser. This may be a regression, as a variation of this issue was already reported in CVE-2023-25578. Limiting the part number is not sufficient to prevent out-of-memory errors on the server. A patch is available in version 2.13.0.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-52797	2024-11-21T11:15:35.480	2025-08-26T16:42:28.820	"Opencast is free and open source software for automated video capture and distribution. First noticed in Opencast 13 and 14, Opencast's Elasticsearch integration may generate syntactically invalid Elasticsearch queries in relation to previously acceptable search queries. From Opencast version 11.4 and newer, Elasticsearch queries are retried a configurable number of times in the case of error to handle temporary losses of connection to Elasticsearch. These invalid queries would fail, causing the retry mechanism to begin requerying with the same syntactically invalid query immediately, in an infinite loop. This causes a massive increase in log size which can in some cases cause a denial of service due to disk exhaustion.

Opencast 13.10 and Opencast 14.3 contain patches which address the base issue, with Opencast 16.7 containing changes which harmonize the search behaviour between the admin UI and external API. Users are strongly recommended to upgrade as soon as possible if running versions prior to 13.10 or 14.3. While the relevant endpoints require (by default) `ROLE_ADMIN` or `ROLE_API_SERIES_VIEW`, the problem queries are otherwise innocuous. This issue could be easily triggered by normal administrative work on an affected Opencast system. Those who run a version newer than 13.10 and 14.3 and see different results when searching in their admin UI vs your external API or LMS, may resolve the issue by upgrading to 16.7.

CVE-2024-45194	2024-11-21T17:15:15.440	2025-06-11T15:40:45.710	In Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) 9.0 and 10.0, a vulnerability in the Webmail Modern UI allows execution of stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads. An attacker with administrative access to the Zimbra Administration Panel can inject malicious JavaScript code while configuring an email account. This injected code is stored on the server and executed in the context of the victim's browser when interacting with specific elements in the web interface. (The vulnerability can be mitigated by properly sanitizing input parameters to prevent the injection of malicious code.)	4.8	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

One powerful feature of SFTPGo is the ability to have the EventManager execute scripts or run applications in response to certain events. This feature is very common in all software similar to SFTPGo and is generally unrestricted. However, any SFTPGo administrator with permission to run a script has access to the underlying OS/container with the same permissions as the user running SFTPGo. This is unexpected for some SFTPGo administrators who think that there is a clear distinction between accessing the system shell and accessing the SFTPGo WebAdmin UI. To avoid this confusion, running system commands is disabled by default in 2.6.3, and an allow list has been added so that system administrators configuring SFTPGo must explicitly define which commands are allowed to be configured from the WebAdmin UI.

afs_wake_up_async_call() can incur lock recursion.  The problem is that it
is called from AF_RXRPC whilst holding the ->notify_lock, but it tries to
take a ref on the afs_call struct in order to pass it to a work queue - but
if the afs_call is already queued, we then have an extraneous ref that must
be put... calling afs_put_call() may call back down into AF_RXRPC through

CVE-2024-53095	2024-11-21T19:15:12.867	2025-03-24T17:21:57.960	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: Fix use-after-free of network namespace.

Recently, we got a customer report that CIFS triggers oops while
reconnecting to a server.  [0]

The workload runs on Kubernetes, and some pods mount CIFS servers
in non-root network namespaces.  The problem rarely happened, but
it was always while the pod was dying.

The root cause is wrong reference counting for network namespace.

CIFS uses kernel sockets, which do not hold refcnt of the netns that
the socket belongs to.  That means CIFS must ensure the socket is
always freed before its netns; otherwise, use-after-free happens.

The repro steps are roughly:

  1. mount CIFS in a non-root netns
  2. drop packets from the netns
  3. destroy the netns
  4. unmount CIFS

We can reproduce the issue quickly with the script [1] below and see
the splat [2] if CONFIG_NET_NS_REFCNT_TRACKER is enabled.

When the socket is TCP, it is hard to guarantee the netns lifetime
without holding refcnt due to async timers.

Let's hold netns refcnt for each socket as done for SMC in commit
9744d2bf1976 (""smc: Fix use-after-free in tcp_write_timer_handler()."").

Note that we need to move put_net() from cifs_put_tcp_session() to
clean_demultiplex_info(); otherwise, __sock_create() still could touch a
freed netns while cifsd tries to reconnect from cifs_demultiplex_thread().

Also, maybe_get_net() cannot be put just before __sock_create() because
the code is not under RCU and there is a small chance that the same
address happened to be reallocated to another netns.

CVE-2024-51074	2024-11-22T16:15:33.860	2025-01-13T15:15:08.953	Incorrect access control in KIA Seltos vehicle instrument cluster with software and hardware v1.0 allows attackers to arbitrarily change odometer readings in the vehicle by targeting the instrument cluster through the unsecured CAN network. NOTE: this is disputed by the supplier because the CAN bus is not externally exposed, and because the packets can only increase the odometer reading (which typically has no value to an adversary). Also, this is disputed by the Supplier because the findings came from a potentially unrealistic test environment (an isolated ECU part that was not in a vehicle), and because the observed behavior follows the UDS (Unified Diagnostic Services) specification.	6.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:H

Prior to version 1.0.11, `http/file-server`'s `serveDir` with `showDirListing: true` option is vulnerable to cross-site scripting when the attacker is a user who can control file names in the source directory on systems with POSIX file names. Exploitation might also be possible on other systems but less trivial due to e.g. lack of file name support for `<>` in Windows. Version 1.0.11 fixes the issue.					
CVE-2024-52802	2024-11-22T16:15:34.283	2025-09-04T23:42:07.727	RIOT is an operating system for internet of things (IoT) devices. In version 2024.04 and prior, the function `_parse_advertise`, located in `/sys/net/application_layer/dhcpv6/client.c`, has no minimum header length check for `dhcpv6_opt_t` after processing `dhcpv6_msg_t`. This omission could lead to an out-of-bound read, causing system inconsistency. Additionally, the same lack of a header length check is present in the function `_preparse_advertise`, which is called by `_parse_advertise` before handling the request.

CVE-2024-53253	2024-11-22T20:15:09.210	2025-09-15T18:03:56.837	"Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Version 24.11.0, and only version 24.11.0, is vulnerable to a scenario where a specific error message generated by the Sentry platform could include a plaintext Client ID and Client Secret for an application integration. The Client ID and Client Secret would not be displayed in the UI, but would be returned in the underlying HTTP response to the end user. This could occur under the following conditions: An app installation made use of a Search UI component with the `async` flag set to true (default: true); auser types types into the Search Component which creates a request to the third-party for search or query results; and that third-party response may then fail validation and Sentry would return the `select-requester.invalid-response` error code along with a serialized version of a Sentry application containing the integration Client Secret. Should this error be found, it's reasonable to assume the potential exposure of an integration Client Secret. However, an ID and Secret pair alone does not provide direct access to any data. For that secret to be abused an attacker would also need to obtain a valid API token for a Sentry application. 

Sentry SaaS users do not need to take any action. For Sentry SaaS users, only a single application integration was impacted and the owner has rotated their Client Secret. No abuse of the leaked Client Secret has occurred.

As of time of publication, a fix is available for users of Sentry self-hosted in pull request 81038. Sentry self-hosted does not ship with any application integrations. This could only impact self-hosted users that maintain their own integrations. In that case, search for a `select-requester.invalid-response` event. Please note that this error was also shared with another event unrelated to this advisory so Sentry self-hosted users will also need to review the parameters logged for each named event. Sentry self-hosted users may review `select_requester.py` for the instances where these errors can be generated. With the security fix this is no longer a shared event type. Sentry self-hosted users may not install version 24.11.0 and instead wait for the next release. Self-hosted instance that are already running the affected version may consider downgrading to to 24.10.0."	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

A Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack can happen if an attacker supplies all or part of a URL to the server to query. The server is considered to be in a privileged network position and can often reach exposed services that aren't readily available to clients due to network filtering. Leveraging such an attack vector, the attacker can have an impact on other services and potentially disclose information or have other nefarious effects on the system.
The /api/dev-console/proxy/internet endpoint on the OpenShift Console allows authenticated users to have the console's pod perform arbitrary and fully controlled HTTP(s) requests. The full response to these requests is returned by the endpoint.
While the name of this endpoint suggests the requests are only bound to the internet, no such checks are in place. An authenticated user can therefore ask the console to perform arbitrary HTTP requests from outside the cluster to a service inside the cluster."	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

CVE-2024-52811	2024-11-25T19:15:11.567	2024-11-25T19:15:11.567	The ngtcp2 project is an effort to implement IETF QUIC protocol in C. In affected versions acks are not validated before being written to the qlog leading to a buffer overflow. In `ngtcp2_conn::conn_recv_pkt` for an ACK, there was new logic that got added to skip `conn_recv_ack` if an ack has already been processed in the payload. However, this causes us to also skip `ngtcp2_pkt_validate_ack`. The ack which was skipped still got written to qlog. The bug occurs in `ngtcp2_qlog::write_ack_frame`. It is now possible to reach this code with an invalid ack, suppose `largest_ack=0` and `first_ack_range=15`. Subtracting `largest_ack - first_ack_range` will lead to an integer underflow which is 20 chars long. However, the ngtcp2 qlog code assumes the number written is a signed integer and only accounts for 19 characters of overhead (see `NGTCP2_QLOG_ACK_FRAME_RANGE_OVERHEAD`). Therefore, we overwrite the buffer causing a heap overflow. This is high priority and could potentially impact many users if they enable qlog. qlog is disabled by default. Due to its overhead, it is most likely used for debugging purpose, but the actual use is unknown. ngtcp2 v1.9.1 fixes the bug and users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not turn on qlog.	8.2	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H

mm: resolve faulty mmap_region() error path behaviour

The mmap_region() function is somewhat terrifying, with spaghetti-like
control flow and numerous means by which issues can arise and incomplete
state, memory leaks and other unpleasantness can occur.

A large amount of the complexity arises from trying to handle errors late
in the process of mapping a VMA, which forms the basis of recently
observed issues with resource leaks and observable inconsistent state.

Taking advantage of previous patches in this series we move a number of
checks earlier in the code, simplifying things by moving the core of the
logic into a static internal function __mmap_region().

Doing this allows us to perform a number of checks up front before we do
any real work, and allows us to unwind the writable unmap check
unconditionally as required and to perform a CONFIG_DEBUG_VM_MAPLE_TREE
validation unconditionally also.

We move a number of things here:

1. We preallocate memory for the iterator before we call the file-backed
   memory hook, allowing us to exit early and avoid having to perform
   complicated and error-prone close/free logic. We carefully free
   iterator state on both success and error paths.

2. The enclosing mmap_region() function handles the mapping_map_writable()
   logic early. Previously the logic had the mapping_map_writable() at the
   point of mapping a newly allocated file-backed VMA, and a matching
   mapping_unmap_writable() on success and error paths.

   We now do this unconditionally if this is a file-backed, shared writable
   mapping. If a driver changes the flags to eliminate VM_MAYWRITE, however
   doing so does not invalidate the seal check we just performed, and we in
   any case always decrement the counter in the wrapper.

   We perform a debug assert to ensure a driver does not attempt to do the
   opposite.

3. We also move arch_validate_flags() up into the mmap_region()
   function. This is only relevant on arm64 and sparc64, and the check is
   only meaningful for SPARC with ADI enabled. We explicitly add a warning
   for this arch if a driver invalidates this check, though the code ought
   eventually to be fixed to eliminate the need for this.

With all of these measures in place, we no longer need to explicitly close
the VMA on error paths, as we place all checks which might fail prior to a
call to any driver mmap hook.

This eliminates an entire class of errors, makes the code easier to reason
about and more robust."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

mm: krealloc: Fix MTE false alarm in __do_krealloc

This patch addresses an issue introduced by commit 1a83a716ec233 (""mm:
krealloc: consider spare memory for __GFP_ZERO"") which causes MTE
(Memory Tagging Extension) to falsely report a slab-out-of-bounds error.

The problem occurs when zeroing out spare memory in __do_krealloc. The
original code only considered software-based KASAN and did not account
for MTE. It does not reset the KASAN tag before calling memset, leading
to a mismatch between the pointer tag and the memory tag, resulting
in a false positive.

A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the authentication flow of the application. This issue arises due to improper sanitization of the URL parameters, allowing the URL bar's contents to be injected and reflected into the HTML page. An attacker could craft a malicious URL to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browser of a victim who visits the link. Any application utilizing this authentication library is vulnerable. Users of the application are at risk if they can be lured into clicking on a crafted malicious link. The vulnerability has been patched in version 2.5.5 by ensuring proper sanitization and escaping of user input in the affected URL parameters. Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade. If upgrading is not immediately possible, users can implement the following workarounds: 1. Employ a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block malicious requests containing suspicious URL parameters. or 2. Apply input validation and escaping directly within the application’s middleware or reverse proxy layer, specifically targeting the affected parameters.	8.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

The quotes '' are usually used in TuneD logs citing raw user input, so there will always be the ' character ending the spoofed input, and the administrator can easily overlook this. This logged string is later used in logging and in the output of utilities, for example, `tuned-adm get_instances` or other third-party programs that use Tuned's D-Bus interface for such operations.	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

CVE-2024-52008	2024-11-26T19:15:29.583	2025-09-23T13:43:13.310	Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. The user invite acceptance API endpoint lacks server-side password policy enforcement, allowing users to set arbitrarily weak passwords by bypassing client-side validation. While the UI enforces password complexity requirements, direct API calls can circumvent these checks, enabling the creation of accounts with passwords as short as a single character. When an email messaging provider is enabled and a new user account is created in the system, an invite email containing a special link is sent to the new user's email address. This link directs the new user to a page where they can set their initial password. While the user interface implements password complexity checks, these validations are only performed client-side. The underlying `/api/v1/user/accept-invite` API endpoint does not implement the same password policy validations. This vulnerability allows an invited user to set an extremely weak password for their own account during the initial account setup process. Therefore that specific user's account can be compromised easily by an attacker guessing or brute forcing the password. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.50.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

This bug impacts clients using any variation of KeylessVerifier.verify(). The verifier may accept a bundle with an unrelated log entry, cryptographically verifying everything but fails to ensure the log entry applies to the artifact in question, thereby ""verifying"" a bundle without any proof the signing event was logged. This allows the creation of a bundle without fulcio certificate and private key combined with an unrelated but time-correct log entry to fake logging of a signing event. A malicious actor using a compromised identity may want to do this to prevent discovery via rekor's log monitors. The signer's identity will still be available to the verifier. The signature on the bundle must still be on the correct artifact for the verifier to pass. sigstore-gradle-plugin and sigstore-maven-plugin are not affected by this as they only provide signing functionality.

A path traversal vulnerability exists in the backup export functionality of EDDI, as implemented in `RestExportService.java`. This vulnerability allows an attacker to access sensitive files on the server by manipulating the `botFilename` parameter in requests. The application fails to sanitize user input, enabling malicious inputs such as `..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd` to access arbitrary files. However, the **severity of this vulnerability is significantly limited** because EDDI typically runs within a **Docker container**, which provides additional layers of isolation and restricted permissions. As a result, while this vulnerability exposes files within the container, it does not inherently threaten the underlying host system or other containers. A patch is required to sanitize and validate the botFilename input parameter. Users should ensure they are using version 5.4 which contains this patdch. For temporary mitigation, access to the vulnerable endpoint should be restricted through firewall rules or authentication mechanisms.	6.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

CVE-2023-29001	2024-11-27T19:15:31.497	2025-04-10T14:58:31.463	Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for IoT devices. The Contiki-NG operating system processes source routing headers (SRH) in its two alternative RPL protocol implementations. The IPv6 implementation uses the results of this processing to determine whether an incoming packet should be forwarded to another host. Because of missing validation of the resulting next-hop address, an uncontrolled recursion may occur in the tcpip_ipv6_output function in the os/net/ipv6/tcpip.c module when receiving a packet with a next-hop address that is a local address. Attackers that have the possibility to send IPv6 packets to the Contiki-NG host can therefore trigger deeply nested recursive calls, which can cause a stack overflow. The vulnerability has not been patched in the current release of Contiki-NG, but is expected to be patched in the next release. The problem can be fixed by applying the patch in Contiki-NG pull request #2264. Users are advised to either apply the patch manually or to wait for the next release. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2024-41125	2024-11-27T19:15:32.883	2025-04-10T14:55:43.850	Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for IoT devices. An out-of-bounds read of 1 byte can be triggered when sending a packet to a device running the Contiki-NG operating system with SNMP enabled. The SNMP module is disabled in the default Contiki-NG configuration. The vulnerability exists in the os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-ber.c module, where the function snmp_ber_decode_string_len_buffer decodes the string length from a received SNMP packet. In one place, one byte is read from the buffer, without checking that the buffer has another byte available, leading to a possible out-of-bounds read. The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG pull request #2936. It will be included in the next release of Contiki-NG. Users are advised to apply the patch manually or to wait for the next release. A workaround is to disable the SNMP module in the Contiki-NG build configuration.	8.3	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

The SNMP module is disabled in the default Contiki-NG configuration. The vulnerability exists in the os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-message.c module, where the snmp_message_decode function fails to check the boundary of the message buffer when reading a byte from it immediately after decoding an object identifier (OID). The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG pull request 2937. It will be included in the next release of Contiki-NG.

CVE-2024-47181	2024-11-27T19:15:33.247	2025-04-10T14:49:56.173	Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for IoT devices. An unaligned memory access can be triggered in the two RPL implementations of the Contiki-NG operating system. The problem can occur when either one of these RPL implementations is enabled and connected to an RPL instance. If an IPv6 packet containing an odd number of padded bytes before the RPL option, it can cause the rpl_ext_header_hbh_update function to read a 16-bit integer from an odd address. The impact of this unaligned read is architecture-dependent, but can potentially cause the system to crash. The problem has not been patched as of release 4.9, but will be included in the next release. One can apply the changes in Contiki-NG pull request #2962 to patch the system or wait for the next release.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-53858	2024-11-27T22:15:05.520	2024-11-27T22:15:05.520	The gh cli is GitHub’s official command line tool. A security vulnerability has been identified in the GitHub CLI that could leak authentication tokens when cloning repositories containing `git` submodules hosted outside of GitHub.com and ghe.com. This vulnerability stems from several `gh` commands used to clone a repository with submodules from a non-GitHub host including `gh repo clone`, `gh repo fork`, and `gh pr checkout`. These GitHub CLI commands invoke git with instructions to retrieve authentication tokens using the `credential.helper` configuration variable for any host encountered. Prior to version `2.63.0`, hosts other than GitHub.com and ghe.com are treated as GitHub Enterprise Server hosts and have tokens sourced from the following environment variables before falling back to host-specific tokens stored within system-specific secured storage: 1. `GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`, 2. `GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN` and 3. `GITHUB_TOKEN` when the `CODESPACES` environment variable is set. The result being `git` sending authentication tokens when cloning submodules. In version `2.63.0`, these GitHub CLI commands will limit the hosts for which `gh` acts as a credential helper to source authentication tokens. Additionally, `GITHUB_TOKEN` will only be used for GitHub.com and ghe.com. Users are advised to upgrade. Additionally users are advised to revoke authentication tokens used with the GitHub CLI and to review their personal security log and any relevant audit logs for actions associated with their account or enterprise	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L

A security vulnerability has been identified in `go-gh` that could leak authentication tokens intended for GitHub hosts to non-GitHub hosts when within a codespace. `go-gh` sources authentication tokens from different environment variables depending on the host involved: 1. `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN` for GitHub.com and ghe.com and 2. `GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`, `GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN` for GitHub Enterprise Server. Prior to version `2.11.1`, `auth.TokenForHost` could source a token from the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable for a host other than GitHub.com or ghe.com when within a codespace. In version `2.11.1`, `auth.TokenForHost` will only source a token from the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable for GitHub.com or ghe.com hosts. Successful exploitation could send authentication token to an unintended host. This issue has been addressed in version 2.11.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. Users are also advised to regenerate authentication tokens and to review their personal security log and any relevant audit logs for actions associated with their account or enterprise.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L

reads Arrow IPC, Feather or Parquet data from untrusted sources (for 
example, user-supplied input files). This vulnerability only affects the arrow R package, not other Apache Arrow 
implementations or bindings unless those bindings are specifically used via the R package (for example, an R application that embeds a Python interpreter and uses PyArrow to read files from untrusted sources is still vulnerable if the arrow R package is an affected version). It is recommended that users of the arrow R package upgrade to 17.0.0 or later. Similarly, it
 is recommended that downstream libraries upgrade their dependency 
requirements to arrow 17.0.0 or later. If using an affected

Executing policy checks using custom schematron files via the CLI invokes an XSL transformation that may theoretically lead to a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability. This doesn't affect the standard validation and policy checks functionality, veraPDF's common use cases. Most veraPDF users don't insert any custom XSLT code into policy profiles, which are based on Schematron syntax rather than direct XSL transforms.

CVE-2024-52810	2024-11-29T19:15:09.163	2024-11-29T19:15:09.163	@intlify/shared is a shared library for the intlify project. The latest version of @intlify/shared (10.0.4) is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution through the entry function(s) lib.deepCopy. An attacker can supply a payload with Object.prototype setter to introduce or modify properties within the global prototype chain, causing denial of service (DoS) as the minimum consequence. Moreover, the consequences of this vulnerability can escalate to other injection-based attacks, depending on how the library integrates within the application. For instance, if the polluted property propagates to sensitive Node.js APIs (e.g., exec, eval), it could enable an attacker to execute arbitrary commands within the application's context. This issue has been addressed in versions 9.14.2, and 10.0.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.					
CVE-2024-53848	2024-11-29T19:15:09.290	2024-11-29T19:15:09.290	check-jsonschema is a CLI and set of pre-commit hooks for jsonschema validation. The default cache strategy uses the basename of a remote schema as the name of the file in the cache, e.g. `https://example.org/schema.json` will be stored as `schema.json`. This naming allows for conflicts. If an attacker can get a user to run `check-jsonschema` against a malicious schema URL, e.g., `https://example.evil.org/schema.json`, they can insert their own schema into the cache and it will be picked up and used instead of the appropriate schema. Such a cache confusion attack could be used to allow data to pass validation which should have been rejected. This issue has been patched in version 0.30.0. All users are advised to upgrade. A few workarounds exist: 1. Users can use `--no-cache` to disable caching. 2. Users can use `--cache-filename` to select filenames for use in the cache, or to ensure that other usages do not overwrite the cached schema. (Note: this flag is being deprecated as part of the remediation effort.) 3. Users can explicitly download the schema before use as a local file, as in `curl -LOs https://example.org/schema.json; check-jsonschema --schemafile ./schema.json`	7.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N

CVE-2024-53980	2024-11-29T19:15:09.993	2025-09-05T13:57:24.993	RIOT is an open-source microcontroller operating system, designed to match the requirements of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and other embedded devices. A malicious actor can send a IEEE 802.15.4 packet with spoofed length byte and optionally spoofed FCS, which eventually results into an endless loop on a CC2538 as receiver. Before PR #20998, the receiver would check for the location of the CRC bit using the packet length byte by considering all 8 bits, instead of discarding bit 7, which is what the radio does. This then results into reading outside of the RX FIFO.  Although it prints an error when attempting to read outside of the RX FIFO, it will continue doing this. This may lead to a discrepancy in the CRC check according to the firmware and the radio. If the CPU judges the CRC as correct and the radio is set to `AUTO_ACK`, when the packet requests and acknowledgment the CPU will go into the state `CC2538_STATE_TX_ACK`. However, if the radio judged the CRC as incorrect, it will not send an acknowledgment, and thus the `TXACKDONE` event will not fire. It will then never return to the state `CC2538_STATE_READY` since the baseband processing is still disabled. Then the CPU will be in an endless loop. Since setting to idle is not forced, it won't do it if the radio's state is not `CC2538_STATE_READY`. A fix has not yet been made.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
