thermal/debugfs: Fix two locking issues with thermal zone debug

With the current thermal zone locking arrangement in the debugfs code,
user space can open the ""mitigations"" file for a thermal zone before
the zone's debugfs pointer is set which will result in a NULL pointer
dereference in tze_seq_start().

Moreover, thermal_debug_tz_remove() is not called under the thermal
zone lock, so it can run in parallel with the other functions accessing
the thermal zone's struct thermal_debugfs object.  Then, it may clear
tz->debugfs after one of those functions has checked it and the
struct thermal_debugfs object may be freed prematurely.

To address the first problem, pass a pointer to the thermal zone's
struct thermal_debugfs object to debugfs_create_file() in
thermal_debug_tz_add() and make tze_seq_start(), tze_seq_next(),
tze_seq_stop(), and tze_seq_show() retrieve it from s->private
instead of a pointer to the thermal zone object.  This will ensure
that tz_debugfs will be valid across the ""mitigations"" file accesses
until thermal_debugfs_remove_id() called by thermal_debug_tz_remove()
removes that file.

To address the second problem, use tz->lock in thermal_debug_tz_remove()
around the tz->debugfs value check (in case the same thermal zone is
removed at the same time in two different threads) and its reset to NULL.

net: ks8851: Queue RX packets in IRQ handler instead of disabling BHs

Currently the driver uses local_bh_disable()/local_bh_enable() in its
IRQ handler to avoid triggering net_rx_action() softirq on exit from
netif_rx(). The net_rx_action() could trigger this driver .start_xmit
callback, which is protected by the same lock as the IRQ handler, so
calling the .start_xmit from netif_rx() from the IRQ handler critical
section protected by the lock could lead to an attempt to claim the
already claimed lock, and a hang.

The local_bh_disable()/local_bh_enable() approach works only in case
the IRQ handler is protected by a spinlock, but does not work if the
IRQ handler is protected by mutex, i.e. this works for KS8851 with
Parallel bus interface, but not for KS8851 with SPI bus interface.

Remove the BH manipulation and instead of calling netif_rx() inside
the IRQ handler code protected by the lock, queue all the received
SKBs in the IRQ handler into a queue first, and once the IRQ handler
exits the critical section protected by the lock, dequeue all the
queued SKBs and push them all into netif_rx(). At this point, it is
safe to trigger the net_rx_action() softirq, since the netif_rx()
call is outside of the lock that protects the IRQ handler."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2024-36963	2024-06-03T08:15:09.820	2025-09-17T21:01:58.510	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracefs: Reset permissions on remount if permissions are options

There's an inconsistency with the way permissions are handled in tracefs.
Because the permissions are generated when accessed, they default to the
root inode's permission if they were never set by the user. If the user
sets the permissions, then a flag is set and the permissions are saved via
the inode (for tracefs files) or an internal attribute field (for
eventfs).

But if a remount happens that specify the permissions, all the files that
were not changed by the user gets updated, but the ones that were are not.
If the user were to remount the file system with a given permission, then
all files and directories within that file system should be updated.

This can cause security issues if a file's permission was updated but the
admin forgot about it. They could incorrectly think that remounting with
permissions set would update all files, but miss some.

For example:

 # cd /sys/kernel/tracing
 # chgrp 1002 current_tracer
 # ls -l
[..]
 -rw-r-----  1 root root 0 May  1 21:25 buffer_size_kb
 -rw-r-----  1 root root 0 May  1 21:25 buffer_subbuf_size_kb
 -r--r-----  1 root root 0 May  1 21:25 buffer_total_size_kb
 -rw-r-----  1 root lkp  0 May  1 21:25 current_tracer
 -rw-r-----  1 root root 0 May  1 21:25 dynamic_events
 -r--r-----  1 root root 0 May  1 21:25 dyn_ftrace_total_info
 -r--r-----  1 root root 0 May  1 21:25 enabled_functions

Where current_tracer now has group ""lkp"".

 # mount -o remount,gid=1001 .
 # ls -l
 -rw-r-----  1 root tracing 0 May  1 21:25 buffer_size_kb
 -rw-r-----  1 root tracing 0 May  1 21:25 buffer_subbuf_size_kb
 -r--r-----  1 root tracing 0 May  1 21:25 buffer_total_size_kb
 -rw-r-----  1 root lkp     0 May  1 21:25 current_tracer
 -rw-r-----  1 root tracing 0 May  1 21:25 dynamic_events
 -r--r-----  1 root tracing 0 May  1 21:25 dyn_ftrace_total_info
 -r--r-----  1 root tracing 0 May  1 21:25 enabled_functions

Everything changed but the ""current_tracer"".

Add a new link list that keeps track of all the tracefs_inodes which has
the permission flags that tell if the file/dir should use the root inode's
permission or not. Then on remount, clear all the flags so that the
default behavior of using the root inode's permission is done for all
files and directories."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2024-36400	2024-06-04T15:15:46.980	2024-11-21T09:22:06.187	nano-id is a unique string ID generator for Rust. Affected versions of the nano-id crate incorrectly generated IDs using a reduced character set in the `nano_id::base62` and `nano_id::base58` functions. Specifically, the `base62` function used a character set of 32 symbols instead of the intended 62 symbols, and the `base58` function used a character set of 16 symbols instead of the intended 58 symbols. Additionally, the `nano_id::gen` macro is also affected when a custom character set that is not a power of 2 in size is specified. It should be noted that `nano_id::base64` is not affected by this vulnerability. This can result in a significant reduction in entropy, making the generated IDs predictable and vulnerable to brute-force attacks when the IDs are used in security-sensitive contexts such as session tokens or unique identifiers.

CVE-2024-4084	2024-06-05T00:15:09.840	2024-11-21T09:42:09.817	A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the latest version of mintplex-labs/anything-llm, allowing attackers to bypass the official fix intended to restrict access to intranet IP addresses and protocols. Despite efforts to filter out intranet IP addresses starting with 192, 172, 10, and 127 through regular expressions and limit access protocols to HTTP and HTTPS, attackers can still bypass these restrictions using alternative representations of IP addresses and accessing other ports running on localhost. This vulnerability enables attackers to access any asset on the internal network, attack web services on the internal network, scan hosts on the internal network, and potentially access AWS metadata endpoints. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied URLs, which can be exploited to perform SSRF attacks.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

Specifically, when a user initiates the password reset process, the recovery token is included in the response of the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint, which lists all users in a team. This allows any authenticated user to capture the recovery token of another user and subsequently change that user's password without consent, effectively taking over the account. The issue lies in the inclusion of the `recovery_token` attribute in the users object returned by the API.	8.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2024-5186	2024-06-06T19:16:05.860	2025-05-19T16:49:21.883	A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the file upload section of imartinez/privategpt version 0.5.0. This vulnerability allows attackers to send crafted requests that could result in unauthorized access to the local network and potentially sensitive information. Specifically, by manipulating the 'path' parameter in a file upload request, an attacker can cause the application to make arbitrary requests to internal services, including the AWS metadata endpoint. This issue could lead to the exposure of internal servers and sensitive data.	7.2	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N		
CVE-2024-5187	2024-06-06T19:16:06.100	2024-11-21T09:47:09.147	A vulnerability in the `download_model_with_test_data` function of the onnx/onnx framework, version 1.16.0, allows for arbitrary file overwrite due to inadequate prevention of path traversal attacks in malicious tar files. This vulnerability enables attackers to overwrite any file on the system, potentially leading to remote code execution, deletion of system, personal, or application files, thus impacting the integrity and availability of the system. The issue arises from the function's handling of tar file extraction without performing security checks on the paths within the tar file, as demonstrated by the ability to overwrite the `/home/kali/.ssh/authorized_keys` file by specifying an absolute path in the malicious tar file.	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2024-5206	2024-06-06T19:16:06.363	2024-11-21T09:47:11.143	A sensitive data leakage vulnerability was identified in scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer, specifically in versions up to and including 1.4.1.post1, which was fixed in version 1.5.0. The vulnerability arises from the unexpected storage of all tokens present in the training data within the `stop_words_` attribute, rather than only storing the subset of tokens required for the TF-IDF technique to function. This behavior leads to the potential leakage of sensitive information, as the `stop_words_` attribute could contain tokens that were meant to be discarded and not stored, such as passwords or keys. The impact of this vulnerability varies based on the nature of the data being processed by the vectorizer.	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2024-5225	2024-06-06T19:16:06.673	2024-11-21T09:47:13.340	An SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the berriai/litellm repository, specifically within the `/global/spend/logs` endpoint. The vulnerability arises due to improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command. The affected code constructs an SQL query by concatenating an unvalidated `api_key` parameter directly into the query, making it susceptible to SQL Injection if the `api_key` contains malicious data. This issue affects the latest version of the repository. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, exposure of confidential information, and denial of service (DoS).	7.2	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2024-5248	2024-06-06T19:16:06.917	2024-11-21T09:47:16.293	In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.5, an improper access control vulnerability exists due to a missing permission check in the `GET /v1/users/me/org` endpoint. The platform's role definitions restrict the `Prompt Editor` role to prompt management and project viewing/listing capabilities, explicitly excluding access to user information. However, the endpoint fails to enforce this restriction, allowing users with the `Prompt Editor` role to access the full list of users in the organization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information, violating the intended access controls.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2024-5278	2024-06-06T19:16:07.310	2024-11-21T09:47:20.347	gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt is vulnerable to an unrestricted file upload vulnerability due to insufficient validation of uploaded file types in its `/upload` endpoint. Specifically, the `handle_file_upload` function does not sanitize or validate the file extension or content type of uploaded files, allowing attackers to upload files with arbitrary extensions, including HTML files containing XSS payloads and Python files. This vulnerability, present in the latest version as of 20240310, could lead to stored XSS attacks and potentially result in remote code execution (RCE) on the server hosting the application.	6.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

System Companion Processor, and it's not granted that both the SRAM
(L2TCM) size that is defined in the devicetree node is large enough
for that, and while this is especially true for multi-core SCP, it's
still useful to check on single-core variants as well.

Failing to perform this check may make this driver perform R/W

kernel panic.

l2cap_le_flowctl_init() can cause both div-by-zero and an integer

Move MTU from hci_dev to hci_conn to validate MTU and stop the connection

Also, add a missing validation in read_buffer_size() and make it return
an error value if the validation fails.
Now hci_conn_add() returns ERR_PTR() as it can fail due to the both a

drm/amd/display: Fix division by zero in setup_dsc_config

When slice_height is 0, the division by slice_height in the calculation
of the number of slices will cause a division by zero driver crash. This
leaves the kernel in a state that requires a reboot. This patch adds a
check to avoid the division by zero.

The stack trace below is for the 6.8.4 Kernel. I reproduced the issue on
a Z16 Gen 2 Lenovo Thinkpad with a Apple Studio Display monitor
connected via Thunderbolt. The amdgpu driver crashed with this exception
when I rebooted the system with the monitor connected.

CVE-2024-4146	2024-06-08T20:15:52.117	2024-11-21T09:42:16.633	In lunary-ai/lunary version v1.2.13, an incorrect authorization vulnerability exists that allows unauthorized users to access and manipulate projects within an organization they should not have access to. Specifically, the vulnerability is located in the `checkProjectAccess` method within the authorization middleware, which fails to adequately verify if a user has the correct permissions to access a specific project. Instead, it only checks if the user is part of the organization owning the project, overlooking the necessary check against the `account_project` table for explicit project access rights. This flaw enables attackers to gain complete control over all resources within a project, including the ability to create, update, read, and delete any resource, compromising the privacy and security of sensitive information.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

This issue was observed in a self-hosted ZenML deployment via Docker, where after changing the password from one browser, the session remained active and usable in another browser without requiring re-authentication.	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

The vulnerability arises from the use of a GET request to clear personality files list, which lacks proper CSRF protection. This flaw allows attackers to trick users into performing actions without their consent, such as deleting important files on the system. The issue is present in the application's handling of requests, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks that could lead to unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of the user.	8.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H

net: fix __dst_negative_advice() race

__dst_negative_advice() does not enforce proper RCU rules when
sk->dst_cache must be cleared, leading to possible UAF.

RCU rules are that we must first clear sk->sk_dst_cache,
then call dst_release(old_dst).

Note that sk_dst_reset(sk) is implementing this protocol correctly,
while __dst_negative_advice() uses the wrong order.

Given that ip6_negative_advice() has special logic
against RTF_CACHE, this means each of the three ->negative_advice()
existing methods must perform the sk_dst_reset() themselves.

Note the check against NULL dst is centralized in
__dst_negative_advice(), there is no need to duplicate
it in various callbacks.

Many thanks to Clement Lecigne for tracking this issue.

af_unix: Update unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb under sk_receive_queue lock.

Billy Jheng Bing-Jhong reported a race between __unix_gc() and
queue_oob().

__unix_gc() tries to garbage-collect close()d inflight sockets,
and then if the socket has MSG_OOB in unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb, GC
will drop the reference and set NULL to it locklessly.

However, the peer socket still can send MSG_OOB message and
queue_oob() can update unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb concurrently, leading
NULL pointer dereference. [0]

To fix the issue, let's update unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb under the
sk_receive_queue's lock and take it everywhere we touch oob_skb.

Note that we defer kfree_skb() in manage_oob() to silence lockdep
false-positive (See [1]).

CVE-2024-37166	2024-06-10T22:15:12.187	2024-11-21T09:23:20.727	ghtml is software that uses tagged templates for template engine functionality. It is possible to introduce user-controlled JavaScript code and trigger a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in some cases. Version 2.0.0 introduces changes to mitigate this issue. Version 2.0.0 contains updated documentation to clarify that while ghtml escapes characters with special meaning in HTML, it does not provide comprehensive protection against all types of XSS attacks in every scenario. This aligns with the approach taken by other template engines. Developers should be cautious and take additional measures to sanitize user input and prevent potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, the backtick character (`) is now also escaped to prevent the creation of strings in most cases where a malicious actor somehow gains the ability to write JavaScript. This does not provide comprehensive protection either.	8.9	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L

CVE-2024-35235	2024-06-11T15:16:07.473	2025-09-26T23:51:23.693	OpenPrinting CUPS is an open source printing system for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. In versions 2.4.8 and earlier, when starting the cupsd server with a Listen configuration item pointing to a symbolic link, the cupsd process can be caused to perform an arbitrary chmod of the provided argument, providing world-writable access to the target. Given that cupsd is often running as root, this can result in the change of permission of any user or system files to be world writable. Given the aforementioned Ubuntu AppArmor context, on such systems this vulnerability is limited to those files modifiable by the cupsd process. In that specific case it was found to be possible to turn the configuration of the Listen argument into full control over the cupsd.conf and cups-files.conf configuration files. By later setting the User and Group arguments in cups-files.conf, and printing with a printer configured by PPD with a `FoomaticRIPCommandLine` argument, arbitrary user and group (not root) command execution could be achieved, which can further be used on Ubuntu systems to achieve full root command execution.

CVE-2024-37293	2024-06-11T17:16:04.237	2024-11-21T09:23:32.963	"The AWS Deployment Framework (ADF) is a framework to manage and deploy resources across multiple AWS accounts and regions within an AWS Organization. ADF allows for staged, parallel, multi-account, cross-region deployments of applications or resources via the structure defined in AWS Organizations while taking advantage of services such as AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeCommit to alleviate the heavy lifting and management compared to a traditional CI/CD setup. ADF contains a bootstrap process that is responsible to deploy ADF's bootstrap stacks to facilitate multi-account cross-region deployments. The ADF bootstrap process relies on elevated privileges to perform this task. Two versions of the bootstrap process exist; a code-change driven pipeline using AWS CodeBuild and an event-driven state machine using AWS Lambda. If an actor has permissions to change the behavior of the CodeBuild project or the Lambda function, they would be able to escalate their privileges.

Prior to version 4.0.0, the bootstrap CodeBuild role provides access to the `sts:AssumeRole` operation without further restrictions. Therefore, it is able to assume into any AWS Account in the AWS Organization with the elevated privileges provided by the cross-account access role. By default, this role is not restricted when it is created by AWS Organizations, providing Administrator level access to the AWS resources in the AWS Account. The patches for this issue are included in `aws-deployment-framework` version 4.0.0.

As a temporary mitigation, add a permissions boundary to the roles created by ADF in the management account. The permissions boundary should deny all IAM and STS actions. This permissions boundary should be in place until you upgrade ADF or bootstrap a new account. While the permissions boundary is in place, the account management and bootstrapping of accounts are unable to create, update, or assume into roles. This mitigates the privilege escalation risk, but also disables ADF's ability to create, manage, and bootstrap accounts."	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

Versions of 3.x prior to 3.2.4 and 4.x prior to 4.2.0 have a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. The `/proxy` endpoint accepts a `host` path segment in the format `/proxy/<host>`. When this endpoint is called with an invalid `host` value, `jupyter-server-proxy` replies with a response that includes the value of `host`, without sanitization [2]. A third-party actor can leverage this by sending a phishing link with an invalid `host` value containing custom JavaScript to a user. When the user clicks this phishing link, the browser renders the response of `GET /proxy/<host>`, which runs the custom JavaScript contained in `host` set by the actor. As any arbitrary JavaScript can be run after the user clicks on a phishing link, this issue permits extensive access to the user's JupyterLab instance for an actor. Patches are included in versions 4.2.0 and 3.2.4. As a workaround, server operators who are unable to upgrade can disable the `jupyter-server-proxy` extension.	9.6	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

Fixing this mistake required adding a special case for the check_allowed_to_delegate() function: If the target service argument is NULL, then it means the KDC is probing for general constrained delegation rules and not checking a specific S4U2Proxy request.

In FreeIPA 4.11.0, the behavior of ipadb_match_acl() was modified to match the changes from upstream MIT Kerberos 1.20. However, a mistake resulting in this mechanism applies in cases where the target service argument is set AND where it is unset. This results in S4U2Proxy requests being accepted regardless of whether or not there is a matching service delegation rule."	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

This key is different for each new session, which protects it from brute force attacks. However, the ticket it contains is encrypted using the target principal key directly. For user principals, this key is a hash of a public per-principal randomly-generated salt and the user’s password.

If a principal is compromised it means the attacker would be able to retrieve tickets encrypted to any principal, all of them being encrypted by their own key directly. By taking these tickets and salts offline, the attacker could run brute force attacks to find character strings able to decrypt tickets when combined to a principal salt (i.e. find the principal’s password)."	8.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

The NuGetGallery has a security vulnerability related to its handling of autolinks in Markdown content.

JupyterHub < 5.0, when used with `GlobusOAuthenticator`, could be configured to allow all users from a particular institution only. This worked fine prior to JupyterHub 5.0, because `allow_all` did not take precedence over `identity_provider`. Since JupyterHub 5.0, `allow_all` does take precedence over `identity_provider`. On a hub with the same config, now all users will be allowed to login, regardless of `identity_provider`. `identity_provider` will basically be ignored.

CVE-2024-37309	2024-06-13T14:15:13.060	2025-09-04T19:11:21.617	"CrateDB is a distributed SQL database. A high-risk vulnerability has been identified in versions prior to 5.7.2 where the TLS endpoint (port 4200) permits client-initiated renegotiation. In this scenario, an attacker can exploit this feature to repeatedly request renegotiation of security parameters during an ongoing TLS session. This flaw could lead to excessive consumption of CPU resources, resulting in potential server overload and service disruption. The vulnerability was confirmed using an openssl client where the command `R` initiates renegotiation, followed by the server confirming with `RENEGOTIATING`. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a denial of service attack by exhausting server CPU resources through repeated TLS renegotiations. This impacts the availability of services running on the affected server, posing a significant risk to operational stability and security. TLS 1.3 explicitly forbids renegotiation, since it closes a window of opportunity for an attack. Version 5.7.2 of CrateDB contains the fix for the issue.

CVE-2024-37164	2024-06-13T15:15:52.990	2025-01-21T14:35:52.867	Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) is an interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision. CVAT allows users to supply custom endpoint URLs for cloud storages based on Amazon S3 and Azure Blob Storage. Starting in version 2.1.0 and prior to version 2.14.3, an attacker with a CVAT account can exploit this feature by specifying URLs whose host part is an intranet IP address or an internal domain name. By doing this, the attacker may be able to probe the network that the CVAT backend runs in for HTTP(S) servers. In addition, if there is a web server on this network that is sufficiently API-compatible with an Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage endpoint, and either allows anonymous access, or allows authentication with credentials that are known by the attacker, then the attacker may be able to create a cloud storage linked to this server. They may then be able to list files on the server; extract files from the server, if these files are of a type that CVAT supports reading from cloud storage (media data (such as images/videos/archives), importable annotations or datasets, task/project backups); and/or overwrite files on this server with exported annotations/datasets/backups. The exact capabilities of the attacker will depend on how the internal server is configured. Users should upgrade to CVAT 2.14.3 to receive a patch. In this release, the existing SSRF mitigation measures are applied to requests to cloud providers, with access to intranet IP addresses prohibited by default. Some workarounds are also available. One may use network security solutions such as virtual networks or firewalls to prohibit network access from the CVAT backend to unrelated servers on your internal network and/or require authentication for access to internal servers.	7.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2024-37306	2024-06-13T15:15:53.333	2025-01-21T14:37:34.690	Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) is an interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision. Starting in version 2.2.0 and prior to version 2.14.3, if an attacker can trick a logged-in CVAT user into visiting a malicious URL, they can initiate a dataset export or a backup from a project, task or job that the victim user has permission to export into a cloud storage that the victim user has access to. The name of the resulting file can be chosen by the attacker. This implies that the attacker can overwrite arbitrary files in any cloud storage that the victim can access and, if the attacker has read access to the cloud storage used in the attack, they can obtain media files, annotations, settings and other information from any projects, tasks or jobs that the victim has permission to export. Version 2.14.3 contains a fix for the issue. No known workarounds are available.	7.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N

In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the following ways: 1. Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the --max-http-header-size=size and/or the maxHeaderSize options so that no more headers than the server.maxHeadersCount limit can be sent. 2. Set server.maxHeadersCount to 0 so that no limit is applied.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2024-37891	2024-06-17T20:15:13.450	2024-11-21T09:24:28.953	 urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected. However, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects. Because this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident. Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach. We believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited: 1. Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support. 2. Not disabling HTTP redirects. 3. Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin. Users are advised to update to either version 1.26.19 or version 2.2.2. Users unable to upgrade may use the `Proxy-Authorization` header with urllib3's `ProxyManager`, disable HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests, or not user the `Proxy-Authorization` header as mitigations.	4.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

Minder's Git provider is vulnerable to a denial of service from a maliciously configured GitHub repository. The Git provider clones users repositories using the `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5` library on lines `L55-L89`. The Git provider does the following on the lines `L56-L62`. First, it sets the `CloneOptions`, specifying the url, the depth etc. It then validates the options. It then sets up an in-memory filesystem, to which it clones and Finally, it clones the repository. The `(g *Git) Clone()` method is vulnerable to a DoS attack: A Minder user can instruct Minder to clone a large repository which will exhaust memory and crash the Minder server. The root cause of this vulnerability is a combination of the following conditions: 1. Users can control the Git URL which Minder clones, 2. Minder does not enforce a size limit to the repository, 3. Minder clones the entire repository into memory. This issue has been addressed in commit `7979b43` which has been included in release version v0.0.52. Users are advised to upgrade.

In affected versions a malicious user may be able to compromise other user accounts. In order to be exploited users must have both OAuth2 and Password auth methods enabled. A possible attack scenario could be: 1. a malicious actor register with the targeted user's email (it is unverified), 2. at some later point in time the targeted user stumble on your app and decides to sign-up with OAuth2 (_this step could be also initiated by the attacker by sending an invite email to the targeted user_), 3. on successful OAuth2 auth we search for an existing PocketBase user matching with the OAuth2 user's email and associate them, 4. because we haven't changed the password of the existing PocketBase user during the linking, the malicious actor has access to the targeted user account and will be able to login with the initially created email/password. To prevent this for happening we now reset the password for this specific case if the previously created user wasn't verified (an exception to this is if the linking is explicit/manual, aka. when you send `Authorization:TOKEN` with the OAuth2 auth call). Additionally to warn existing users we now send an email alert in case the user has logged in with password but has at least one OAuth2 account linked. The flow will be further improved with ongoing refactoring and we will start sending emails for ""unrecognized device"" logins (OTP and MFA is already implemented and will be available with the next v0.23.0 release in the near future). For the time being users are advised to update to version 0.22.14. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

usb: dwc3: Wait unconditionally after issuing EndXfer command

Currently all controller IP/revisions except DWC3_usb3 >= 310a
wait 1ms unconditionally for ENDXFER completion when IOC is not
set. This is because DWC_usb3 controller revisions >= 3.10a
supports GUCTL2[14: Rst_actbitlater] bit which allows polling
CMDACT bit to know whether ENDXFER command is completed.

Consider a case where an IN request was queued, and parallelly
soft_disconnect was called (due to ffs_epfile_release). This
eventually calls stop_active_transfer with IOC cleared, hence
send_gadget_ep_cmd() skips waiting for CMDACT cleared during
EndXfer. For DWC3 controllers with revisions >= 310a, we don't
forcefully wait for 1ms either, and we proceed by unmapping the
requests. If ENDXFER didn't complete by this time, it leads to
SMMU faults since the controller would still be accessing those
requests.

Fix this by ensuring ENDXFER completion by adding 1ms delay in

Undefined behavior is triggered when bnxt_qplib_alloc_init_hwq is called
with hwq_attr->aux_depth != 0 and hwq_attr->aux_stride == 0.
In that case, ""roundup_pow_of_two(hwq_attr->aux_stride)"" gets called.
roundup_pow_of_two is documented as undefined for 0.

Fix it in the one caller that had this combination.

The undefined behavior was detected by UBSAN:

CVE-2024-38558	2024-06-19T14:15:15.983	2024-11-21T09:26:20.560	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: openvswitch: fix overwriting ct original tuple for ICMPv6

OVS_PACKET_CMD_EXECUTE has 3 main attributes:
 - OVS_PACKET_ATTR_KEY - Packet metadata in a netlink format.
 - OVS_PACKET_ATTR_PACKET - Binary packet content.
 - OVS_PACKET_ATTR_ACTIONS - Actions to execute on the packet.

OVS_PACKET_ATTR_KEY is parsed first to populate sw_flow_key structure
with the metadata like conntrack state, input port, recirculation id,
etc.  Then the packet itself gets parsed to populate the rest of the
keys from the packet headers.

Whenever the packet parsing code starts parsing the ICMPv6 header, it
first zeroes out fields in the key corresponding to Neighbor Discovery
information even if it is not an ND packet.

It is an 'ipv6.nd' field.  However, the 'ipv6' is a union that shares
the space between 'nd' and 'ct_orig' that holds the original tuple
conntrack metadata parsed from the OVS_PACKET_ATTR_KEY.

ND packets should not normally have conntrack state, so it's fine to
share the space, but normal ICMPv6 Echo packets or maybe other types of
ICMPv6 can have the state attached and it should not be overwritten.

The issue results in all but the last 4 bytes of the destination
address being wiped from the original conntrack tuple leading to
incorrect packet matching and potentially executing wrong actions
in case this packet recirculates within the datapath or goes back
to userspace.

ND fields should not be accessed in non-ND packets, so not clearing
them should be fine.  Executing memset() only for actual ND packets to
avoid the issue.

Initializing the whole thing before parsing is needed because ND packet
may not contain all the options.

The issue only affects the OVS_PACKET_CMD_EXECUTE path and doesn't
affect packets entering OVS datapath from network interfaces, because
in this case CT metadata is populated from skb after the packet is
already parsed."

Syzbot has reported a potential hang in nilfs_detach_log_writer() called

during their analysis.  Details are described in each commit log.


This patch (of 3):

A use-after-free issue has been reported regarding the timer sc_timer on
the nilfs_sc_info structure.

The problem is that even though it is used to wake up a sleeping log
writer thread, sc_timer is not shut down until the nilfs_sc_info structure

Fix this issue by limiting the use of sc_timer only while the log writer

drm/mediatek: Init `ddp_comp` with devm_kcalloc()

In the case where `conn_routes` is true we allocate an extra slot in

initialize it in the test case I ran. For me, this caused a later
crash when we looped through the array in mtk_drm_crtc_mode_valid().
This showed up for me when I booted with `slub_debug=FZPUA` which
poisons the memory initially. Without `slub_debug` I couldn't
reproduce, presumably because the later code handles the value being
NULL and in most cases (not guaranteed in all cases) the memory the
allocator returned started out as 0.

It really doesn't hurt to initialize the array with devm_kcalloc()
since the array is small and the overhead of initting a handful of
elements to 0 is small. In general initting memory to zero is a safer
practice and usually it's suggested to only use the non-initting alloc
functions if you really need to.

Let's switch the function to use an allocation function that zeros the
memory. For me, this avoids the crash."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Add a check to make sure that the requested xattr node size is no larger

must not occupy more than one eraseblock. If the requested xattr value is

ALSA: Fix deadlocks with kctl removals at disconnection

In snd_card_disconnect(), we set card->shutdown flag at the beginning,
call callbacks and do sync for card->power_ref_sleep waiters at the
end.  The callback may delete a kctl element, and this can lead to a
deadlock when the device was in the suspended state.  Namely:

* A process waits for the power up at snd_power_ref_and_wait() in
  snd_ctl_info() or read/write() inside card->controls_rwsem.

* The system gets disconnected meanwhile, and the driver tries to
  delete a kctl via snd_ctl_remove*(); it tries to take
  card->controls_rwsem again, but this is already locked by the
  above.  Since the sleeper isn't woken up, this deadlocks.

An easy fix is to wake up sleepers before processing the driver
disconnect callbacks but right after setting the card->shutdown flag.
Then all sleepers will abort immediately, and the code flows again.

So, basically this patch moves the wait_event() call at the right
timing.  While we're at it, just to be sure, call wait_event_all()
instead of wait_event(), although we don't use exclusive events on
this queue for now."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

ring-buffer: Fix a race between readers and resize checks

The reader code in rb_get_reader_page() swaps a new reader page into the
ring buffer by doing cmpxchg on old->list.prev->next to point it to the
new page. Following that, if the operation is successful,
old->list.next->prev gets updated too. This means the underlying
doubly-linked list is temporarily inconsistent, page->prev->next or
page->next->prev might not be equal back to page for some page in the
ring buffer.

The resize operation in ring_buffer_resize() can be invoked in parallel.
It calls rb_check_pages() which can detect the described inconsistency
and stop further tracing:

(""tracing: Stop current tracer when resizing buffer"") causes that it is
now always the case which makes it more likely to experience this issue.

The window to hit this race is nonetheless very small. To help
reproducing it, one can add a delay loop in rb_get_reader_page():

 ret = rb_head_page_replace(reader, cpu_buffer->reader_page);
 if (!ret)
 	goto spin;

ALSA: core: Fix NULL module pointer assignment at card init

The commit 81033c6b584b (""ALSA: core: Warn on empty module"")
introduced a WARN_ON() for a NULL module pointer passed at snd_card
object creation, and it also wraps the code around it with '#ifdef
MODULE'.  This works in most cases, but the devils are always in
details.  ""MODULE"" is defined when the target code (i.e. the sound
core) is built as a module; but this doesn't mean that the caller is
also built-in or not.  Namely, when only the sound core is built-in
(CONFIG_SND=y) while the driver is a module (CONFIG_SND_USB_AUDIO=m),
the passed module pointer is ignored even if it's non-NULL, and
card->module remains as NULL.  This would result in the missing module
reference up/down at the device open/close, leading to a race with the
code execution after the module removal.

For addressing the bug, move the assignment of card->module again out
of ifdef.  The WARN_ON() is still wrapped with ifdef because the
module can be really NULL when all sound drivers are built-in.

Note that we keep 'ifdef MODULE' for WARN_ON(), otherwise it would
lead to a false-positive NULL module check.  Admittedly it won't catch
perfectly, i.e. no check is performed when CONFIG_SND=y.  But, it's no
real problem as it's only for debugging, and the condition is pretty
rare."	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

drivers/virt/acrn: fix PFNMAP PTE checks in acrn_vm_ram_map()

Patch series ""mm: follow_pte() improvements and acrn follow_pte() fixes"".

Patch #1 fixes a bunch of issues I spotted in the acrn driver.  It
compiles, that's all I know.  I'll appreciate some review and testing from
acrn folks.

Patch #2+#3 improve follow_pte(), passing a VMA instead of the MM, adding
more sanity checks, and improving the documentation.  Gave it a quick test
on x86-64 using VM_PAT that ends up using follow_pte().


This patch (of 3):

We currently miss handling various cases, resulting in a dangerous
follow_pte() (previously follow_pfn()) usage.

(1) We're not checking PTE write permissions.

Maybe we should simply always require pte_write() like we do for
pin_user_pages_fast(FOLL_WRITE)? Hard to tell, so let's check for
ACRN_MEM_ACCESS_WRITE for now.

(2) We're not rejecting refcounted pages.

As we are not using MMU notifiers, messing with refcounted pages is
dangerous and can result in use-after-free. Let's make sure to reject them.

(3) We are only looking at the first PTE of a bigger range.

We only lookup a single PTE, but memmap->len may span a larger area.
Let's loop over all involved PTEs and make sure the PFN range is
actually contiguous. Reject everything else: it couldn't have worked
either way, and rather made use access PFNs we shouldn't be accessing."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

m68k: Fix spinlock race in kernel thread creation

Context switching does take care to retain the correct lock owner across
the switch from 'prev' to 'next' tasks.  This does rely on interrupts
remaining disabled for the entire duration of the switch.

This condition is guaranteed for normal process creation and context
switching between already running processes, because both 'prev' and
'next' already have interrupts disabled in their saved copies of the
status register.

The situation is different for newly created kernel threads.  The status
register is set to PS_S in copy_thread(), which does leave the IPL at 0.
Upon restoring the 'next' thread's status register in switch_to() aka
resume(), interrupts then become enabled prematurely.  resume() then
returns via ret_from_kernel_thread() and schedule_tail() where run queue
lock is released (see finish_task_switch() and finish_lock_switch()).

A timer interrupt calling scheduler_tick() before the lock is released
in finish_task_switch() will find the lock already taken, with the
current task as lock owner.  This causes a spinlock recursion warning as
reported by Guenter Roeck.

As far as I can ascertain, this race has been opened in commit
533e6903bea0 (""m68k: split ret_from_fork(), simplify kernel_thread()"")
but I haven't done a detailed study of kernel history so it may well
predate that commit.

Interrupts cannot be disabled in the saved status register copy for
kernel threads (init will complain about interrupts disabled when
finally starting user space).  Disable interrupts temporarily when
switching the tasks' register sets in resume().

Note that a simple oriw 0x700,%sr after restoring sr is not enough here
- this leaves enough of a race for the 'spinlock recursion' warning to
still be observed.

We check IO_WQ_BIT_EXIT before attempting to create a new worker, and
wq exit cancels pending work if we have any. But it's possible to have
a race between the two, where creation checks exit finding it not set,
but we're in the process of exiting. The exit side will cancel pending
creation task_work, but there's a gap where we add task_work after we've
canceled existing creations at exit time.

Fix this by checking the EXIT bit post adding the creation task_work.

Syzbot reported, that mxl111sf_ctrl_msg() uses uninitialized

Previous mutex_init(&state->msg_lock) call was in ->init() function, but

iocost: Fix divide-by-zero on donation from low hweight cgroup

The donation calculation logic assumes that the donor has non-zero

have is 2 so that it can donate 1 while keeping the other 1 for itself.
Earlier, we only donated from cgroups with sizable surpluses so this
condition was always true. However, with the precise donation algorithm
implemented, f1de2439ec43 (""blk-iocost: revamp donation amount

This means that in rare occasions, a cgroup with active hweight of 1 can
enter donation calculation triggering the following warning and then a

net: systemport: Add global locking for descriptor lifecycle

The descriptor list is a shared resource across all of the transmit queues, and
the locking mechanism used today only protects concurrency across a given
transmit queue between the transmit and reclaiming. This creates an opportunity
for the SYSTEMPORT hardware to work on corrupted descriptors if we have
multiple producers at once which is the case when using multiple transmit
queues.

This was particularly noticeable when using multiple flows/transmit queues and
it showed up in interesting ways in that UDP packets would get a correct UDP
header checksum being calculated over an incorrect packet length. Similarly TCP
packets would get an equally correct checksum computed by the hardware over an
incorrect packet length.

The SYSTEMPORT hardware maintains an internal descriptor list that it re-arranges
when the driver produces a new descriptor anytime it writes to the
WRITE_PORT_{HI,LO} registers, there is however some delay in the hardware to
re-organize its descriptors and it is possible that concurrent TX queues
eventually break this internal allocation scheme to the point where the
length/status part of the descriptor gets used for an incorrect data buffer.

The fix is to impose a global serialization for all TX queues in the short
section where we are writing to the WRITE_PORT_{HI,LO} registers which solves
the corruption even with multiple concurrent TX queues being used."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

igbvf: fix double free in `igbvf_probe`

In `igbvf_probe`, if register_netdev() fails, the program will go to
label err_hw_init, and then to label err_ioremap. In free_netdev() which
is just below label err_ioremap, there is `list_for_each_entry_safe` and
`netif_napi_del` which aims to delete all entries in `dev->napi_list`.
The program has added an entry `adapter->rx_ring->napi` which is added by
`netif_napi_add` in igbvf_alloc_queues(). However, adapter->rx_ring has
been freed below label err_hw_init. So this a UAF.

In terms of how to patch the problem, we can refer to igbvf_remove() and
delete the entry before `adapter->rx_ring`.

The above issue is due to previous incorrect implementation of
tc_del_vlan_flow(), shown below, that uses flow_cls_offload_flow_rule()
to get struct flow_rule *rule which is no longer valid for tc filter
delete operation.

  struct flow_rule *rule = flow_cls_offload_flow_rule(cls);
  struct flow_dissector *dissector = rule->match.dissector;

So, to ensure tc_del_vlan_flow() deletes the right VLAN cls record for
earlier configured RX queue (configured by hw_tc) in tc_add_vlan_flow(),
this patch introduces stmmac_rfs_entry as driver-side flow_cls_offload
record for 'RX frame steering' tc flower, currently used for VLAN
priority. The implementation has taken consideration for future extension
to include other type RX frame steering such as EtherType based.

working for plain tcp sockets (any userspace-exposed socket).

But in case of fallback, accept() can return a plain tcp sk.

Reason:
While btrfs_prepare_sprout() moves the fs_devices::devices into
fs_devices::seed_list, the btrfs_show_devname() searches for the devices
and found none, leading to the warning as in above.

Fix:
latest_dev is updated according to the changes to the device list.
That means we could use the latest_dev->name to show the device name in
/proc/self/mounts, the pointer will be always valid as it's assigned
before the device is deleted from the list in remove or replace.

audit: improve robustness of the audit queue handling

If the audit daemon were ever to get stuck in a stopped state the
kernel's kauditd_thread() could get blocked attempting to send audit
records to the userspace audit daemon.  With the kernel thread
blocked it is possible that the audit queue could grow unbounded as
certain audit record generating events must be exempt from the queue
limits else the system enter a deadlock state.

This patch resolves this problem by lowering the kernel thread's
socket sending timeout from MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT to HZ/10 and tweaks
the kauditd_send_queue() function to better manage the various audit
queues when connection problems occur between the kernel and the
audit daemon.  With this patch, the backlog may temporarily grow
beyond the defined limits when the audit daemon is stopped and the
system is under heavy audit pressure, but kauditd_thread() will
continue to make progress and drain the queues as it would for other
connection problems.  For example, with the audit daemon put into a
stopped state and the system configured to audit every syscall it
was still possible to shutdown the system without a kernel panic,
deadlock, etc.; granted, the system was slow to shutdown but that is
to be expected given the extreme pressure of recording every syscall.

The timeout value of HZ/10 was chosen primarily through
experimentation and this developer's ""gut feeling"".  There is likely
no one perfect value, but as this scenario is limited in scope (root
privileges would be needed to send SIGSTOP to the audit daemon), it
is likely not worth exposing this as a tunable at present.  This can
always be done at a later date if it proves necessary."	4.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

bpf: Fix kernel address leakage in atomic cmpxchg's r0 aux reg

The implementation of BPF_CMPXCHG on a high level has the following parameters:

  .-[old-val]                                          .-[new-val]
  BPF_R0 = cmpxchg{32,64}(DST_REG + insn->off, BPF_R0, SRC_REG)
                          `-[mem-loc]          `-[old-val]

Given a BPF insn can only have two registers (dst, src), the R0 is fixed and
used as an auxilliary register for input (old value) as well as output (returning
old value from memory location). While the verifier performs a number of safety
checks, it misses to reject unprivileged programs where R0 contains a pointer as
old value.

Through brute-forcing it takes about ~16sec on my machine to leak a kernel pointer
with BPF_CMPXCHG. The PoC is basically probing for kernel addresses by storing the
guessed address into the map slot as a scalar, and using the map value pointer as
R0 while SRC_REG has a canary value to detect a matching address.

Fix it by checking R0 for pointers, and reject if that's the case for unprivileged
programs."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

bpf: Fix kernel address leakage in atomic fetch

The change in commit 37086bfdc737 (""bpf: Propagate stack bounds to registers
in atomics w/ BPF_FETCH"") around check_mem_access() handling is buggy since
this would allow for unprivileged users to leak kernel pointers. For example,
an atomic fetch/and with -1 on a stack destination which holds a spilled
pointer will migrate the spilled register type into a scalar, which can then
be exported out of the program (since scalar != pointer) by dumping it into
a map value.

The original implementation of XADD was preventing this situation by using
a double call to check_mem_access() one with BPF_READ and a subsequent one
with BPF_WRITE, in both cases passing -1 as a placeholder value instead of
register as per XADD semantics since it didn't contain a value fetch. The
BPF_READ also included a check in check_stack_read_fixed_off() which rejects
the program if the stack slot is of __is_pointer_value() if dst_regno < 0.
The latter is to distinguish whether we're dealing with a regular stack spill/
fill or some arithmetical operation which is disallowed on non-scalars, see
also 6e7e63cbb023 (""bpf: Forbid XADD on spilled pointers for unprivileged
users"") for more context on check_mem_access() and its handling of placeholder
value -1.

One minimally intrusive option to fix the leak is for the BPF_FETCH case to
initially check the BPF_READ case via check_mem_access() with -1 as register,
followed by the actual load case with non-negative load_reg to propagate
stack bounds to registers."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

However, this is not true, since the notify callback could be called
without any of the queued buffers being completed (for example, with

multiple separate virtqueue_add_sgs() calls).

This can lead to incorrect data on the I2C bus or memory corruption in
the guest if the device operates on buffers which are have been freed by

CVE-2024-32030	2024-06-19T17:15:57.863	2024-11-21T09:14:21.720	Kafka UI is an Open-Source Web UI for Apache Kafka Management. Kafka UI API allows users to connect to different Kafka brokers by specifying their network address and port. As a separate feature, it also provides the ability to monitor the performance of Kafka brokers by connecting to their JMX ports. JMX is based on the RMI protocol, so it is inherently susceptible to deserialization attacks. A potential attacker can exploit this feature by connecting Kafka UI backend to its own malicious broker. This vulnerability affects the deployments where one of the following occurs: 1. dynamic.config.enabled property is set in settings. It's not enabled by default, but it's suggested to be enabled in many tutorials for Kafka UI, including its own README.md. OR  2. an attacker has access to the Kafka cluster that is being connected to Kafka UI. In this scenario the attacker can exploit this vulnerability to expand their access and execute code on Kafka UI as well. Instead of setting up a legitimate JMX port, an attacker can create an RMI listener that returns a malicious serialized object for any RMI call. In the worst case it could lead to remote code execution as Kafka UI has the required gadget chains in its classpath. This issue may lead to post-auth remote code execution. This is particularly dangerous as Kafka-UI does not have authentication enabled by default. This issue has been addressed in version 0.7.2. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. These issues were discovered and reported by the GitHub Security lab and is also tracked as GHSL-2023-230.	8.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2024-36115	2024-06-19T18:15:10.597	2024-11-21T09:21:39.107	Reposilite is an open source, lightweight and easy-to-use repository manager for Maven based artifacts in JVM ecosystem. As a Maven repository manager, Reposilite provides the ability to view the artifacts content in the browser, as well as perform administrative tasks via API. The problem lies in the fact that the artifact's content is served via the same origin (protocol/host/port) as the Admin UI. If the artifact contains HTML content with javascript inside, the javascript is executed within the same origin. Therefore, if an authenticated user is viewing the artifacts content, the javascript inside can access the browser's local storage where the user's password (aka 'token-secret') is stored. It is especially dangerous in scenarios where Reposilite is configured to mirror third party repositories, like the Maven Central Repository. Since anyone can publish an artifact to Maven Central under its own name, such malicious packages can be used to attack the Reposilite instance. This issue may lead to the full Reposilite instance compromise. If this attack is performed against the admin user, it's possible to use the admin API to modify settings and artifacts on the instance. In the worst case scenario, an attacker would be able to obtain the Remote code execution on all systems that use artifacts from Reposilite. It's important to note that the attacker does not need to lure a victim user to use a malicious artifact, but just open a link in the browser. This link can be silently loaded among the other HTML content, making this attack unnoticeable. Even if the Reposilite instance is located in an isolated environment, such as behind a VPN or in the local network, this attack is still possible as it can be performed from the admin browser. Reposilite has addressed this issue in version 3.5.12. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. This issue was discovered and reported by the GitHub Security lab and is also tracked as GHSL-2024-072.	7.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2024-36116	2024-06-19T18:15:10.910	2025-03-06T18:00:51.670	Reposilite is an open source, lightweight and easy-to-use repository manager for Maven based artifacts in JVM ecosystem. Reposilite provides support for JavaDocs files, which are archives that contain documentation for artifacts. Specifically, JavadocEndpoints.kt controller allows to expand the javadoc archive into the server's file system and return its content. The problem is in the way how the archives are expanded, specifically how the new filename is created. The `file.name` taken from the archive can contain path traversal characters, such as '/../../../anything.txt', so the resulting extraction path can be outside the target directory. If the archive is taken from an untrusted source, such as Maven Central or JitPack for example, an attacker can craft a special archive to overwrite any local file on Reposilite instance. This could lead to remote code execution, for example by placing a new plugin into the '$workspace$/plugins' directory. Alternatively, an attacker can overwrite the content of any other package. Note that the attacker can use its own malicious package from Maven Central to overwrite any other package on Reposilite. Reposilite has addressed this issue in version 3.5.12. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

PCI: pciehp: Fix infinite loop in IRQ handler upon power fault

The Power Fault Detected bit in the Slot Status register differs from
all other hotplug events in that it is sticky:  It can only be cleared
after turning off slot power.  Per PCIe r5.0, sec. 6.7.1.8:

  If a power controller detects a main power fault on the hot-plug slot,
  it must automatically set its internal main power fault latch [...].
  The main power fault latch is cleared when software turns off power to
  the hot-plug slot.

The stickiness used to cause interrupt storms and infinite loops which
were fixed in 2009 by commits 5651c48cfafe (""PCI pciehp: fix power fault
interrupt storm problem"") and 99f0169c17f3 (""PCI: pciehp: enable
software notification on empty slots"").

Unfortunately in 2020 the infinite loop issue was inadvertently
reintroduced by commit 8edf5332c393 (""PCI: pciehp: Fix MSI interrupt
race""):  The hardirq handler pciehp_isr() clears the PFD bit until
pciehp's power_fault_detected flag is set.  That happens in the IRQ
thread pciehp_ist(), which never learns of the event because the hardirq
handler is stuck in an infinite loop.  Fix by setting the
power_fault_detected flag already in the hardirq handler."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

ARM: 9170/1: fix panic when kasan and kprobe are enabled

arm32 uses software to simulate the instruction replaced
by kprobe. some instructions may be simulated by constructing
assembly functions. therefore, before executing instruction
simulation, it is necessary to construct assembly function
execution environment in C language through binding registers.
after kasan is enabled, the register binding relationship will
be destroyed, resulting in instruction simulation errors and
causing kernel panic.

the kprobe emulate instruction function is distributed in three
files: actions-common.c actions-arm.c actions-thumb.c, so disable
KASAN when compiling these files.

for example, use kprobe insert on cap_capable+20 after kasan
enabled, the cap_capable assembly code is as follows:

tipc: improve size validations for received domain records

The function tipc_mon_rcv() allows a node to receive and process
domain_record structs from peer nodes to track their views of the

This patch verifies that the number of members in a received domain
record does not exceed the limit defined by MAX_MON_DOMAIN, something
that may otherwise lead to a stack overflow.

tipc_mon_rcv() is called from the function tipc_link_proto_rcv(), where
we are reading a 32 bit message data length field into a uint16.  To
avert any risk of bit overflow, we add an extra sanity check for this in
that function.  We cannot see that happen with the current code, but

perf/x86/intel/pt: Fix crash with stop filters in single-range mode

Add a check for !buf->single before calling pt_buffer_region_size in a
place where a missing check can cause a kernel crash.

Fixes a bug introduced by commit 670638477aed (""perf/x86/intel/pt:
Opportunistically use single range output mode""), which added a
support for PT single-range output mode. Since that commit if a PT
stop filter range is hit while tracing, the kernel will crash because
of a null pointer dereference in pt_handle_status due to calling
pt_buffer_region_size without a ToPA configured.

The commit which introduced single-range mode guarded almost all uses of
the ToPA buffer variables with checks of the buf->single variable, but
missed the case where tracing was stopped by the PT hardware, which
happens when execution hits a configured stop filter.

Tested that hitting a stop filter while PT recording successfully
records a trace with this patch but crashes without this patch."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

  ffffffff8d4dd370 (&tbl->lock){++-.}-{2:2}, at: neigh_managed_work+0x35/0x250 net/core/neighbour.c:1572

The neighbor entry turned to NUD_FAILED state, where __neigh_event_send()
triggered an immediate probe as per commit cd28ca0a3dd1 (""neigh: reduce
arp latency"") via neigh_probe() given table lock was held.

One option to fix this situation is to defer the neigh_probe() back to
the neigh_timer_handler() similarly as pre cd28ca0a3dd1. For the case
of NTF_MANAGED, this deferral is acceptable given this only happens on
actual failure state and regular / expected state is NUD_VALID with the
entry already present.

The fix adds a parameter to __neigh_event_send() in order to communicate
whether immediate probe is allowed or disallowed. Existing call-sites
of neigh_event_send() default as-is to immediate probe. However, the
neigh_managed_work() disables it via use of neigh_event_send_probe().

net/smc: Forward wakeup to smc socket waitqueue after fallback

After the fallback, data flows over TCP/IP and only clcsocket->wq

The crash is caused by privately transferring waitqueue entries from
smc socket->wq to clcsock->wq. The owners of these entries, such as
epoll, have no idea that the entries have been transferred to a
different socket wait queue and still use original waitqueue spinlock
(smc socket->wq.wait.lock) to make the entries operation exclusive,
but it doesn't work. The operations to the entries, such as removing
from the waitqueue (now is clcsock->wq after fallback), may cause a
crash when clcsock waitqueue is being iterated over at the moment.

This patch tries to fix this by no longer transferring wait queue
entries privately, but introducing own implementations of clcsock's
callback functions in fallback situation. The callback functions will
forward the wakeup to smc socket->wq if clcsock->wq is actually woken
up and smc socket->wq has remaining entries."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

KVM: arm64: Avoid consuming a stale esr value when SError occur

When any exception other than an IRQ occurs, the CPU updates the ESR_EL2
register with the exception syndrome. An SError may also become pending,
and will be synchronised by KVM. KVM notes the exception type, and whether
an SError was synchronised in exit_code.

When an exception other than an IRQ occurs, fixup_guest_exit() updates
vcpu->arch.fault.esr_el2 from the hardware register. When an SError was
synchronised, the vcpu esr value is used to determine if the exception
was due to an HVC. If so, ELR_EL2 is moved back one instruction. This
is so that KVM can process the SError first, and re-execute the HVC if
the guest survives the SError.

But if an IRQ synchronises an SError, the vcpu's esr value is stale.
If the previous non-IRQ exception was an HVC, KVM will corrupt ELR_EL2,
causing an unrelated guest instruction to be executed twice.

Check ARM_EXCEPTION_CODE() before messing with ELR_EL2, IRQs don't
update this register so don't need to check."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

btrfs: fix use-after-free after failure to create a snapshot

At ioctl.c:create_snapshot(), we allocate a pending snapshot structure and
then attach it to the transaction's list of pending snapshots. After that
we call btrfs_commit_transaction(), and if that returns an error we jump
to 'fail' label, where we kfree() the pending snapshot structure. This can
result in a later use-after-free of the pending snapshot:

1) We allocated the pending snapshot and added it to the transaction's
   list of pending snapshots;

2) We call btrfs_commit_transaction(), and it fails either at the first
   call to btrfs_run_delayed_refs() or btrfs_start_dirty_block_groups().
   In both cases, we don't abort the transaction and we release our
   transaction handle. We jump to the 'fail' label and free the pending
   snapshot structure. We return with the pending snapshot still in the
   transaction's list;

3) Another task commits the transaction. This time there's no error at
   all, and then during the transaction commit it accesses a pointer
   to the pending snapshot structure that the snapshot creation task
   has already freed, resulting in a user-after-free.

This issue could actually be detected by smatch, which produced the
following warning:

  fs/btrfs/ioctl.c:843 create_snapshot() warn: '&pending_snapshot->list' not removed from list

So fix this by not having the snapshot creation ioctl directly add the
pending snapshot to the transaction's list. Instead add the pending
snapshot to the transaction handle, and then at btrfs_commit_transaction()
we add the snapshot to the list only when we can guarantee that any error
returned after that point will result in a transaction abort, in which
case the ioctl code can safely free the pending snapshot and no one can
access it anymore."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

btrfs: fix deadlock between quota disable and qgroup rescan worker

Quota disable ioctl starts a transaction before waiting for the qgroup
rescan worker completes. However, this wait can be infinite and results
in deadlock because of circular dependency among the quota disable
ioctl, the qgroup rescan worker and the other task with transaction such
as block group relocation task.

The deadlock happens with the steps following:

1) Task A calls ioctl to disable quota. It starts a transaction and
   waits for qgroup rescan worker completes.
2) Task B such as block group relocation task starts a transaction and
   joins to the transaction that task A started. Then task B commits to
   the transaction. In this commit, task B waits for a commit by task A.
3) Task C as the qgroup rescan worker starts its job and starts a
   transaction. In this transaction start, task C waits for completion
   of the transaction that task A started and task B committed.

This deadlock was found with fstests test case btrfs/115 and a zoned
null_blk device. The test case enables and disables quota, and the
block group reclaim was triggered during the quota disable by chance.
The deadlock was also observed by running quota enable and disable in
parallel with 'btrfs balance' command on regular null_blk devices.

ALSA: hda: Fix UAF of leds class devs at unbinding

The LED class devices that are created by HD-audio codec drivers are
registered via devm_led_classdev_register() and associated with the
HD-audio codec device.  Unfortunately, it turned out that the devres
release doesn't work for this case; namely, since the codec resource
release happens before the devm call chain, it triggers a NULL
dereference or a UAF for a stale set_brightness_delay callback.

net/mlx5e: Avoid field-overflowing memcpy()

In preparation for FORTIFY_SOURCE performing compile-time and run-time
field bounds checking for memcpy(), memmove(), and memset(), avoid
intentionally writing across neighboring fields.

Use flexible arrays instead of zero-element arrays (which look like they
are always overflowing) and split the cross-field memcpy() into two halves
that can be appropriately bounds-checked by the compiler.

We were doing:

	#define ETH_HLEN  14
	#define VLAN_HLEN  4
	...
	#define MLX5E_XDP_MIN_INLINE (ETH_HLEN + VLAN_HLEN)

	...
	memcpy(eseg->inline_hdr.start, xdptxd->data, MLX5E_XDP_MIN_INLINE);

target is wqe->eth.inline_hdr.start (which the compiler sees as being
2 bytes in size), but copying 18, intending to write across start
(really vlan_tci, 2 bytes). The remaining 16 bytes get written into
wqe->data[0], covering byte_count (4 bytes), lkey (4 bytes), and addr
(8 bytes).

This patch tries to fix it by holding clcsock_release_lock and
checking whether clcsock has already been released before access.

In case that a crash of the same reason happens in smc_getsockopt()

in them too. And the caller of smc_switch_to_fallback() will identify
whether fallback succeeds according to the return value."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

power_pmu_disable since it runs under interrupt soft disable
condition ( local_irq_save ) and not with interrupts hard disabled.
commit 2c9ac51b850d (""powerpc/perf: Fix PMU callbacks to clear

PMI pending bit in Paca when disabling the PMU. It could happen

CVE-2022-48760	2024-06-20T12:15:14.110	2025-09-17T16:49:52.623	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

USB: core: Fix hang in usb_kill_urb by adding memory barriers

The syzbot fuzzer has identified a bug in which processes hang waiting
for usb_kill_urb() to return.  It turns out the issue is not unlinking
the URB; that works just fine.  Rather, the problem arises when the
wakeup notification that the URB has completed is not received.

The reason is memory-access ordering on SMP systems.  In outline form,
usb_kill_urb() and __usb_hcd_giveback_urb() operating concurrently on
different CPUs perform the following actions:

CPU 0					CPU 1
----------------------------		---------------------------------
usb_kill_urb():				__usb_hcd_giveback_urb():
  ...					  ...
  atomic_inc(&urb->reject);		  atomic_dec(&urb->use_count);
  ...					  ...
  wait_event(usb_kill_urb_queue,
	atomic_read(&urb->use_count) == 0);
					  if (atomic_read(&urb->reject))
						wake_up(&usb_kill_urb_queue);

Confining your attention to urb->reject and urb->use_count, you can
see that the overall pattern of accesses on CPU 0 is:

	write urb->reject, then read urb->use_count;

whereas the overall pattern of accesses on CPU 1 is:

	write urb->use_count, then read urb->reject.

This pattern is referred to in memory-model circles as SB (for ""Store
Buffering""), and it is well known that without suitable enforcement of
the desired order of accesses -- in the form of memory barriers -- it
is entirely possible for one or both CPUs to execute their reads ahead
of their writes.  The end result will be that sometimes CPU 0 sees the
old un-decremented value of urb->use_count while CPU 1 sees the old
un-incremented value of urb->reject.  Consequently CPU 0 ends up on
the wait queue and never gets woken up, leading to the observed hang
in usb_kill_urb().

The same pattern of accesses occurs in usb_poison_urb() and the
failure pathway of usb_hcd_submit_urb().

The problem is fixed by adding suitable memory barriers.  To provide
proper memory-access ordering in the SB pattern, a full barrier is
required on both CPUs.  The atomic_inc() and atomic_dec() accesses
themselves don't provide any memory ordering, but since they are
present, we can use the optimized smp_mb__after_atomic() memory
barrier in the various routines to obtain the desired effect.

This patch adds the necessary memory barriers."	7.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H

This problem was hidden by power domain driver, which call run time resume before it.

But the below commit remove it and make this issue happen.

arm64: extable: fix load_unaligned_zeropad() reg indices

In ex_handler_load_unaligned_zeropad() we erroneously extract the data and
addr register indices from ex->type rather than ex->data. As ex->type will
contain EX_TYPE_LOAD_UNALIGNED_ZEROPAD (i.e. 4):
 * We'll always treat X0 as the address register, since EX_DATA_REG_ADDR is

 * We'll always treat X4 as the data register, since EX_DATA_REG_DATA is

Fix this by extracting both values from ex->data as originally intended.

KVM: x86: Forcibly leave nested virt when SMM state is toggled

Forcibly leave nested virtualization operation if userspace toggles SMM
state via KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS or KVM_SYNC_X86_EVENTS.  If userspace
forces the vCPU out of SMM while it's post-VMXON and then injects an SMI,
vmx_enter_smm() will overwrite vmx->nested.smm.vmxon and end up with both
vmxon=false and smm.vmxon=false, but all other nVMX state allocated.

Don't attempt to gracefully handle the transition as (a) most transitions
are nonsencial, e.g. forcing SMM while L2 is running, (b) there isn't
sufficient information to handle all transitions, e.g. SVM wants access
to the SMRAM save state, and (c) KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS must precede
KVM_SET_NESTED_STATE during state restore as the latter disallows putting
the vCPU into L2 if SMM is active, and disallows tagging the vCPU as
being post-VMXON in SMM if SMM is not active.

Abuse of KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS manifests as a WARN and memory leak in nVMX
due to failure to free vmcs01's shadow VMCS, but the bug goes far beyond
just a memory leak, e.g. toggling SMM on while L2 is active puts the vCPU
in an architecturally impossible state.

efi: runtime: avoid EFIv2 runtime services on Apple x86 machines

Aditya reports [0] that his recent MacbookPro crashes in the firmware
when using the variable services at runtime. The culprit appears to be a
call to QueryVariableInfo(), which we did not use to call on Apple x86
machines in the past as they only upgraded from EFI v1.10 to EFI v2.40
firmware fairly recently, and QueryVariableInfo() (along with
UpdateCapsule() et al) was added in EFI v2.00.

The only runtime service introduced in EFI v2.00 that we actually use in
Linux is QueryVariableInfo(), as the capsule based ones are optional,
generally not used at runtime (all the LVFS/fwupd firmware update
infrastructure uses helper EFI programs that invoke capsule update at
boot time, not runtime), and not implemented by Apple machines in the
first place. QueryVariableInfo() is used to 'safely' set variables,
i.e., only when there is enough space. This prevents machines with buggy
firmwares from corrupting their NVRAMs when they run out of space.

Given that Apple machines have been using EFI v1.10 services only for
the longest time (the EFI v2.0 spec was released in 2006, and Linux
support for the newly introduced runtime services was added in 2011, but
the MacbookPro12,1 released in 2015 still claims to be EFI v1.10 only),
let's avoid the EFI v2.0 ones on all Apple x86 machines.

CVE-2024-31076	2024-06-21T11:15:09.673	2025-09-29T18:25:35.597	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

genirq/cpuhotplug, x86/vector: Prevent vector leak during CPU offline

The absence of IRQD_MOVE_PCNTXT prevents immediate effectiveness of
interrupt affinity reconfiguration via procfs. Instead, the change is
deferred until the next instance of the interrupt being triggered on the
original CPU.

When the interrupt next triggers on the original CPU, the new affinity is
enforced within __irq_move_irq(). A vector is allocated from the new CPU,
but the old vector on the original CPU remains and is not immediately
reclaimed. Instead, apicd->move_in_progress is flagged, and the reclaiming
process is delayed until the next trigger of the interrupt on the new CPU.

Upon the subsequent triggering of the interrupt on the new CPU,
irq_complete_move() adds a task to the old CPU's vector_cleanup list if it
remains online. Subsequently, the timer on the old CPU iterates over its
vector_cleanup list, reclaiming old vectors.

However, a rare scenario arises if the old CPU is outgoing before the
interrupt triggers again on the new CPU.

In that case irq_force_complete_move() is not invoked on the outgoing CPU
to reclaim the old apicd->prev_vector because the interrupt isn't currently
affine to the outgoing CPU, and irq_needs_fixup() returns false. Even
though __vector_schedule_cleanup() is later called on the new CPU, it
doesn't reclaim apicd->prev_vector; instead, it simply resets both
apicd->move_in_progress and apicd->prev_vector to 0.

As a result, the vector remains unreclaimed in vector_matrix, leading to a
CPU vector leak.

To address this issue, move the invocation of irq_force_complete_move()
before the irq_needs_fixup() call to reclaim apicd->prev_vector, if the
interrupt is currently or used to be affine to the outgoing CPU.

Additionally, reclaim the vector in __vector_schedule_cleanup() as well,
following a warning message, although theoretically it should never see
apicd->move_in_progress with apicd->prev_cpu pointing to an offline CPU."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

net/sched: taprio: extend minimum interval restriction to entire cycle too

It is possible for syzbot to side-step the restriction imposed by the
blamed commit in the Fixes: tag, because the taprio UAPI permits a
cycle-time different from (and potentially shorter than) the sum of
entry intervals.

We need one more restriction, which is that the cycle time itself must
be larger than N * ETH_ZLEN bit times, where N is the number of schedule
entries. This restriction needs to apply regardless of whether the cycle
time came from the user or was the implicit, auto-calculated value, so
we move the existing ""cycle == 0"" check outside the ""if ""(!new->cycle_time)""
branch. This way covers both conditions and scenarios.

tcp: Fix shift-out-of-bounds in dctcp_update_alpha().

In dctcp_update_alpha(), we use a module parameter dctcp_shift_g
as follows:

  alpha -= min_not_zero(alpha, alpha >> dctcp_shift_g);
  ...
  delivered_ce <<= (10 - dctcp_shift_g);

It seems syzkaller started fuzzing module parameters and triggered
shift-out-of-bounds [0] by setting 100 to dctcp_shift_g:

  memcpy((void*)0x20000080,
         ""/sys/module/tcp_dctcp/parameters/dctcp_shift_g\000"", 47);
  res = syscall(__NR_openat, /*fd=*/0xffffffffffffff9cul, /*file=*/0x20000080ul,

  syscall(__NR_write, /*fd=*/r[0], /*val=*/0x20000000ul, /*len=*/4ul);

Let's limit the max value of dctcp_shift_g by param_set_uint_minmax().

With this patch:

  # echo 10 > /sys/module/tcp_dctcp/parameters/dctcp_shift_g
  # cat /sys/module/tcp_dctcp/parameters/dctcp_shift_g

The subtract in this condition is reversed.  The ->length is the length

far.  When the condition is reversed that means the result of the
subtraction is always negative but since it's unsigned then the result
is a very high positive value.  That means the overflow check is never
true.

Additionally, the ->bytesused doesn't actually work for this purpose
because we're not writing to ""buf->mem + buf->bytesused"".  Instead, the
math to calculate the destination where we are writing is a bit
involved.  You calculate the number of full lines already written,
multiply by two, skip a line if necessary so that we start on an odd
numbered line, and add the offset into the line.

The warning is due to the FUSE_NOTIFY_RESEND notify sent by the write()

(1) calls fuse_dev_read() to read the INIT request
The read succeeds. During the read, bit FR_SENT will be set on the
request.
(2) calls fuse_dev_write() to send an USE_NOTIFY_RESEND notify
The resend notify will resend all processing requests, so the INIT
request is moved from processing list to pending list again.
(3) calls fuse_dev_read() with an invalid output address
fuse_dev_read() will try to copy the same INIT request to the output

Shinichiro Kawasaki helps to analyse this issue and proposes a potential
fixing patch in [2].

Quoted from reply of Shinichiro Kawasaki:

""I confirmed that the trigger commit is dbf8e63f48af as Yi reported. I took a
look in the commit, but it looks fine to me. So I thought the cause is not
in the commit diff.

I found the WARN is printed when the f2fs is set up with multiple devices,
and read requests are mapped to the very first block of the second device in the
direct read path. In this case, f2fs_map_blocks() and f2fs_map_blocks_cached()
modify map->m_pblk as the physical block address from each block device. It
becomes zero when it is mapped to the first block of the device. However,
f2fs_iomap_begin() assumes that map->m_pblk is the physical block address of the
whole f2fs, across the all block devices. It compares map->m_pblk against
NULL_ADDR == 0, then go into the unexpected branch and sets the invalid
iomap->length. The WARN catches the invalid iomap->length.

This WARN is printed even for non-zoned block devices, by following steps.

 - Create two (non-zoned) null_blk devices memory backed with 128MB size each:
   nullb0 and nullb1.
 # mkfs.f2fs /dev/nullb0 -c /dev/nullb1
 # mount -t f2fs /dev/nullb0 ""${mount_dir}""
 # dd if=/dev/zero of=""${mount_dir}/test.dat"" bs=1M count=192
 # dd if=""${mount_dir}/test.dat"" of=/dev/null bs=1M count=192 iflag=direct

...""

So, the root cause of this issue is: when multi-devices feature is on,
f2fs_map_blocks() may return zero blkaddr in non-primary device, which is
a verified valid block address, however, f2fs_iomap_begin() treats it as
an invalid block address, and then it triggers the warning in iomap
framework code.

Finally, as discussed, we decide to use a more simple and direct way that
checking (map.m_flags & F2FS_MAP_MAPPED) condition instead of
(map.m_pblk != NULL_ADDR) to fix this issue.

Thanks a lot for the effort of Yi Zhang and Shinichiro Kawasaki on this
issue.

CVE-2023-37898	2024-06-21T20:15:11.583	2025-04-11T17:19:44.633	Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application. A Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows an untrusted note opened in safe mode to execute arbitrary code. `packages/renderer/MarkupToHtml.ts` renders note content in safe mode by surrounding it with <pre> and </pre>, without escaping any interior HTML tags. Thus, an attacker can create a note that closes the opening <pre> tag, then includes HTML that runs JavaScript. Because the rendered markdown iframe has the same origin as the toplevel document and is not sandboxed, any scripts running in the preview iframe can access the top variable and, thus, access the toplevel NodeJS `require` function. `require` can then be used to import modules like fs or child_process and run arbitrary commands. This issue has been addressed in version 2.12.9 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	8.2	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L		
CVE-2023-38506	2024-06-21T20:15:12.003	2025-04-11T15:17:15.377	Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application. A Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows pasting untrusted data into the rich text editor to execute arbitrary code. HTML pasted into the rich text editor is not sanitized (or not sanitized properly). As such, the `onload` attribute of pasted images can execute arbitrary code. Because the TinyMCE editor frame does not use the `sandbox` attribute, such scripts can access NodeJS's `require` through the `top` variable. From this, an attacker can run arbitrary commands. This issue has been addressed in version 2.12.10 and users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	8.2	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L		
CVE-2023-39517	2024-06-21T20:15:12.307	2024-11-21T08:15:35.033	Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application. A Cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in affected versions allows clicking on an untrusted image link to execute arbitrary shell commands. The HTML sanitizer (`packages/renderer/htmlUtils.ts::sanitizeHtml`) preserves `<map>` `<area>` links. However, unlike `<a>` links, the `target` and `href` attributes are not removed. Additionally, because the note preview pane isn't sandboxed to prevent top navigation, links with `target` set to `_top` can replace the toplevel electron page. Because any toplevel electron page, with Joplin's setup, has access to `require` and can require node libraries, a malicious replacement toplevel page can import `child_process` and execute arbitrary shell commands. This issue has been fixed in commit 7c52c3e9a81a52ef1b42a951f9deb9d378d59b0f which is included in release version 2.12.8. Users are advised to upgrade.

CVE-2023-45673	2024-06-21T20:15:12.620	2025-04-11T15:17:42.970	Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application. A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in affected versions allows clicking on a link in a PDF in an untrusted note to execute arbitrary shell commands. Clicking links in PDFs allows for arbitrary code execution because Joplin desktop: 1. has not disabled top redirection for note viewer iframes, and 2. and has node integration enabled. This is a remote code execution vulnerability that impacts anyone who attaches untrusted PDFs to notes and has the icon enabled. This issue has been addressed in version 2.13.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	8.9	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L

The vulnerability arises from the `/mount_extension` endpoint, where a path traversal issue allows attackers to navigate beyond the intended directory structure. This is facilitated by the `data.category` and `data.folder` parameters accepting empty strings (`""""`), which, due to inadequate input sanitization, can lead to the construction of a `package_path` that points to the root directory. Consequently, if an attacker can create a `config.yaml` file in a controllable path, this path can be appended to the `extensions` list and trigger the execution of `__init__.py` in the current directory, leading to remote code execution. The vulnerability affects versions up to 5.9.0, and has been addressed in version 9.8."

drm/amdgpu: Fix buffer size in gfx_v9_4_3_init_ cp_compute_microcode() and rlc_microcode()

The function gfx_v9_4_3_init_microcode in gfx_v9_4_3.c was generating
about potential truncation of output when using the snprintf function.
The issue was due to the size of the buffer 'ucode_prefix' being too
small to accommodate the maximum possible length of the string being
written into it.

The string being written is ""amdgpu/%s_mec.bin"" or ""amdgpu/%s_rlc.bin"",
where %s is replaced by the value of 'chip_name'. The length of this
string without the %s is 16 characters. The warning message indicated
that 'chip_name' could be up to 29 characters long, resulting in a total
of 45 characters, which exceeds the buffer size of 30 characters.

To resolve this issue, the size of the 'ucode_prefix' buffer has been
reduced from 30 to 15. This ensures that the maximum possible length of
the string being written into the buffer will not exceed its size, thus
preventing potential buffer overflow and truncation issues.

CVE-2024-5216	2024-06-25T11:15:50.193	2025-07-15T15:38:18.290	A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm allows for a Denial of Service (DoS) condition due to uncontrolled resource consumption. Specifically, the issue arises from the application's failure to limit the size of usernames, enabling attackers to create users with excessively bulky texts in the username field. This exploit results in the user management panel becoming unresponsive, preventing administrators from performing critical user management actions such as editing, suspending, or deleting users. The impact of this vulnerability includes administrative paralysis, compromised security, and operational disruption, as it allows malicious users to perpetuate their presence within the system indefinitely, undermines the system's security posture, and degrades overall system performance.

x86/xen: Drop USERGS_SYSRET64 paravirt call

commit afd30525a659ac0ae0904f0cb4a2ca75522c3123 upstream.

USERGS_SYSRET64 is used to return from a syscall via SYSRET, but
a Xen PV guest will nevertheless use the IRET hypercall, as there
is no sysret PV hypercall defined.

So instead of testing all the prerequisites for doing a sysret and
then mangling the stack for Xen PV again for doing an iret just use
the iret exit from the beginning.

This can easily be done via an ALTERNATIVE like it is done for the
sysenter compat case already.

It should be noted that this drops the optimization in Xen for not
restoring a few registers when returning to user mode, but it seems
as if the saved instructions in the kernel more than compensate for
this drop (a kernel build in a Xen PV guest was slightly faster with
this patch applied).

While at it remove the stale sysret32 remnants.

  [ pawan: Brad Spengler and Salvatore Bonaccorso <carnil@debian.org>
	   reported a problem with the 5.10 backport commit edc702b4a820
	   (""x86/entry_64: Add VERW just before userspace transition"").

	   When CONFIG_PARAVIRT_XXL=y, CLEAR_CPU_BUFFERS is not executed in
	   syscall_return_via_sysret path as USERGS_SYSRET64 is runtime
	   patched to:

	.cpu_usergs_sysret64    = { 0x0f, 0x01, 0xf8,
				    0x48, 0x0f, 0x07 }, // swapgs; sysretq

	   which is missing CLEAR_CPU_BUFFERS. It turns out dropping
	   USERGS_SYSRET64 simplifies the code, allowing CLEAR_CPU_BUFFERS
	   to be explicitly added to syscall_return_via_sysret path. Below
	   is with CONFIG_PARAVIRT_XXL=y and this patch applied:

btrfs: protect folio::private when attaching extent buffer folios

Since v6.8 there are rare kernel crashes reported by various people,
the common factor is bad page status error messages like this:

  page dumped because: non-NULL mapping

[CAUSE]
Commit 09e6cef19c9f (""btrfs: refactor alloc_extent_buffer() to
allocate-then-attach method"") changes the sequence when allocating a new
extent buffer.

Previously we always called grab_extent_buffer() under
mapping->i_private_lock, to ensure the safety on modification on
folio::private (which is a pointer to extent buffer for regular
sectorsize).

This can lead to the following race:

Thread A is trying to allocate an extent buffer at bytenr X, with 4
4K pages, meanwhile thread B is trying to release the page at X + 4K
(the second page of the extent buffer at X).

           Thread A                |                 Thread B
-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------
                                   | btree_release_folio()
				   | | This is for the page at X + 4K,
				   | | Not page X.
				   | |
alloc_extent_buffer()              | |- release_extent_buffer()
|- filemap_add_folio() for the     | |  |- atomic_dec_and_test(eb->refs)
|  page at bytenr X (the first     | |  |
|  page).                          | |  |
|  Which returned -EEXIST.         | |  |
|                                  | |  |
|- filemap_lock_folio()            | |  |
|  Returned the first page locked. | |  |
|                                  | |  |
|- grab_extent_buffer()            | |  |
|  |- atomic_inc_not_zero()        | |  |
|  |  Returned false               | |  |
|  |- folio_detach_private()       | |  |- folio_detach_private() for X
|     |- folio_test_private()      | |     |- folio_test_private()
      |  Returned true             | |     |  Returned true
      |- folio_put()               |       |- folio_put()

Now there are two puts on the same folio at folio X, leading to refcount
underflow of the folio X, and eventually causing the BUG_ON() on the
page->mapping.

The condition is not that easy to hit:

- The release must be triggered for the middle page of an eb
  If the release is on the same first page of an eb, page lock would kick
  in and prevent the race.

- folio_detach_private() has a very small race window
  It's only between folio_test_private() and folio_clear_private().

That's exactly when mapping->i_private_lock is used to prevent such race,
and commit 09e6cef19c9f (""btrfs: refactor alloc_extent_buffer() to
allocate-then-attach method"") screwed that up.

At that time, I thought the page lock would kick in as
filemap_release_folio() also requires the page to be locked, but forgot
the filemap_release_folio() only locks one page, not all pages of an
extent buffer.

[FIX]
Move all the code requiring i_private_lock into
attach_eb_folio_to_filemap(), so that everything is done with proper
lock protection.

Furthermore to prevent future problems, add an extra
lockdep_assert_locked() to ensure we're holding the proper lock.

To reproducer that is able to hit the race (takes a few minutes with
instrumented code inserting delays to alloc_extent_buffer()):

  #!/bin/sh
  drop_caches () {
	  while(true); do
		  echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
		  echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/compact_memory
	  done
  }

  run_tar () {
	  while(true); do
		  for x in `seq 1 80` ; do
			  tar cf /dev/zero /mnt > /dev/null &
		  done
		  wait
	  done
  }

This patch introduced a potential kernel crash when multiple napi instances

possible for multiple napi instances to access the Rx ring at the same time,
which will result in a corrupted ring state which can lead to a crash when

bonding: fix oops during rmmod

""rmmod bonding"" causes an oops ever since commit cc317ea3d927 (""bonding:
remove redundant NULL check in debugfs function"").  Here are the relevant
functions being called:

However, reverting the bad commit does not solve the problem completely
because the original code contains a race that could cause the same
oops, although it was much less likely to be triggered unintentionally:

CPU1
  rmmod bonding
    bonding_exit()
      bond_destroy_debugfs()
        debugfs_remove_recursive(bonding_debug_root);

CPU2

        if (!bonding_debug_root)

CPU1
        bonding_debug_root = NULL;

So do NOT revert the bad commit (since the removed checks were racy
anyway), and instead change the order of actions taken during module
removal.  The same oops can also happen if there is an error during
module init, so apply the same fix there."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

hence takes the forced async prep path.

Current kernels with the request async prep cleaned up can no longer hit

In addition, since nilfs_empty_dir() does not immediately return on a
failed folio/page read, but continues to loop, this can cause a long loop
with I/O if i_size of the directory's inode is also corrupted, causing the
log writer thread to wait and hang, as reported by syzbot.

Fix these issues by making nilfs_empty_dir() immediately return a false

Markdown-based comments in the ZenUML diagram syntax are susceptible to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). The comment feature allows the user to attach small notes for reference. This feature allows the user to enter in their comment in markdown comment, allowing them to use common markdown features, such as `**` for bolded text. However, the markdown text is currently not sanitized before rendering, allowing an attacker to enter a malicious payload for the comment which leads to XSS. This puts existing applications that use ZenUML unsandboxed at risk of arbitrary JavaScript execution when rendering user-controlled diagrams.

CVE-2024-5535	2024-06-27T11:15:24.447	2025-09-01T09:15:34.120	"Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an
empty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to
be sent to the peer.

Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences
such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue
could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent
to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications
that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of
supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never
be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by
accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling
application.

The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS
applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN
(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and
is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more
widely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of
protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns
the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the
client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the
first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap
between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is
called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and
returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports
that there was no overlap in the lists).

This function is typically called from a server side application callback for
ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list
of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in
length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never
normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the
SSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list
supplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the
application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has
accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has
accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len
parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a ""no overlap""
response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it
will be vulnerable to this problem.

In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select
a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol
in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes
from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.
However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a
client_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the
application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of
confidentiality will occur.

This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most
likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not
widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.
Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active
exploitation unlikely.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of
OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they
become available."	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-34703	2024-06-30T21:15:02.053	2024-11-21T09:19:13.827	"Botan is a C++ cryptography library. X.509 certificates can identify elliptic curves using either an object identifier or using explicit encoding of the parameters. Prior to versions 3.3.0 and 2.19.4, an attacker could present an ECDSA X.509 certificate using explicit encoding where the parameters are very large. The proof of concept used a 16Kbit prime for this purpose. When parsing, the parameter is checked to be prime, causing excessive computation. This was patched in 2.19.4 and 3.3.0 to allow the prime parameter of the elliptic curve to be at most 521 bits. No known workarounds are available. Note that support for explicit encoding of elliptic curve parameters is deprecated in Botan.
