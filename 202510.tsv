Also the mwifiex_update_chan_statistics() function doesn't necessarily
initialize the whole array.  Since the array was not initialized at

CVE-2025-39901	2025-10-01T08:15:32.860	2025-10-02T19:12:17.160	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i40e: remove read access to debugfs files

The 'command' and 'netdev_ops' debugfs files are a legacy debugging
interface supported by the i40e driver since its early days by commit
02e9c290814c (""i40e: debugfs interface"").

Both of these debugfs files provide a read handler which is mostly useless,
and which is implemented with questionable logic. They both use a static
256 byte buffer which is initialized to the empty string. In the case of
the 'command' file this buffer is literally never used and simply wastes
space. In the case of the 'netdev_ops' file, the last command written is
saved here.

On read, the files contents are presented as the name of the device
followed by a colon and then the contents of their respective static
buffer. For 'command' this will always be ""<device>: "". For 'netdev_ops',
this will be ""<device>: <last command written>"". But note the buffer is
shared between all devices operated by this module. At best, it is mostly
meaningless information, and at worse it could be accessed simultaneously
as there doesn't appear to be any locking mechanism.

We have also recently received multiple reports for both read functions
about their use of snprintf and potential overflow that could result in
reading arbitrary kernel memory. For the 'command' file, this is definitely
impossible, since the static buffer is always zero and never written to.
For the 'netdev_ops' file, it does appear to be possible, if the user
carefully crafts the command input, it will be copied into the buffer,
which could be large enough to cause snprintf to truncate, which then
causes the copy_to_user to read beyond the length of the buffer allocated
by kzalloc.

A minimal fix would be to replace snprintf() with scnprintf() which would
cap the return to the number of bytes written, preventing an overflow. A
more involved fix would be to drop the mostly useless static buffers,
saving 512 bytes and modifying the read functions to stop needing those as
input.

Instead, lets just completely drop the read access to these files. These
are debug interfaces exposed as part of debugfs, and I don't believe that
dropping read access will break any script, as the provided output is
pretty useless. You can find the netdev name through other more standard
interfaces, and the 'netdev_ops' interface can easily result in garbage if
you issue simultaneous writes to multiple devices at once.

In order to properly remove the i40e_dbg_netdev_ops_buf, we need to
refactor its write function to avoid using the static buffer. Instead, use
the same logic as the i40e_dbg_command_write, with an allocated buffer.
Update the code to use this instead of the static buffer, and ensure we
free the buffer on exit. This fixes simultaneous writes to 'netdev_ops' on
multiple devices, and allows us to remove the now unused static buffer
along with removing the read access."

mm/slub: avoid accessing metadata when pointer is invalid in object_err()

object_err() reports details of an object for further debugging, such as
the freelist pointer, redzone, etc. However, if the pointer is invalid,
attempting to access object metadata can lead to a crash since it does
not point to a valid object.

One known path to the crash is when alloc_consistency_checks()
determines the pointer to the allocated object is invalid because of a
freelist corruption, and calls object_err() to report it. The debug code
should report and handle the corruption gracefully and not crash in the
process.

In case the pointer is NULL or check_valid_pointer() returns false for
the pointer, only print the pointer value and skip accessing metadata."

of_numa: fix uninitialized memory nodes causing kernel panic

When there are memory-only nodes (nodes without CPUs), these nodes are not
properly initialized, causing kernel panic during boot.

of_numa_init
	of_numa_parse_cpu_nodes
		node_set(nid, numa_nodes_parsed);

In of_numa_parse_cpu_nodes, numa_nodes_parsed gets updated only for nodes
containing CPUs.  Memory-only nodes should have been updated in
of_numa_parse_memory_nodes, but they weren't.

Subsequently, when free_area_init() attempts to access NODE_DATA() for
these uninitialized memory nodes, the kernel panics due to NULL pointer
dereference.

CVE-2025-39905	2025-10-01T08:15:33.370	2025-10-02T19:12:17.160	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: phylink: add lock for serializing concurrent pl->phydev writes with resolver

Currently phylink_resolve() protects itself against concurrent
phylink_bringup_phy() or phylink_disconnect_phy() calls which modify
pl->phydev by relying on pl->state_mutex.

The problem is that in phylink_resolve(), pl->state_mutex is in a lock
inversion state with pl->phydev->lock. So pl->phydev->lock needs to be
acquired prior to pl->state_mutex. But that requires dereferencing
pl->phydev in the first place, and without pl->state_mutex, that is
racy.

Hence the reason for the extra lock. Currently it is redundant, but it
will serve a functional purpose once mutex_lock(&phy->lock) will be
moved outside of the mutex_lock(&pl->state_mutex) section.

Another alternative considered would have been to let phylink_resolve()
acquire the rtnl_mutex, which is also held when phylink_bringup_phy()
and phylink_disconnect_phy() are called. But since phylink_disconnect_phy()
runs under rtnl_lock(), it would deadlock with phylink_resolve() when
calling flush_work(&pl->resolve). Additionally, it would have been
undesirable because it would have unnecessarily blocked many other call
paths as well in the entire kernel, so the smaller-scoped lock was
preferred."

tcp_bpf: Call sk_msg_free() when tcp_bpf_send_verdict() fails to allocate psock->cork.

syzbot reported the splat below. [0]

The repro does the following:

  1. Load a sk_msg prog that calls bpf_msg_cork_bytes(msg, cork_bytes)
  2. Attach the prog to a SOCKMAP
  3. Add a socket to the SOCKMAP
  4. Activate fault injection
  5. Send data less than cork_bytes

At 5., the data is carried over to the next sendmsg() as it is
smaller than the cork_bytes specified by bpf_msg_cork_bytes().

Then, tcp_bpf_send_verdict() tries to allocate psock->cork to hold
the data, but this fails silently due to fault injection + __GFP_NOWARN.

If the allocation fails, we need to revert the sk->sk_forward_alloc
change done by sk_msg_alloc().

Let's call sk_msg_free() when tcp_bpf_send_verdict fails to allocate
psock->cork.

The ""*copied"" also needs to be updated such that a proper error can
be returned to the caller, sendmsg. It fails to allocate psock->cork.
Nothing has been corked so far, so this patch simply sets ""*copied""
to 0.

1. echo 8 >> set_event_notrace_pid. Let tr->filtered_pids owns one pid
   and register sched_switch tracepoint.
2. echo ' ' >> set_event_pid, and perform fault injection during chunk
   allocation of trace_pid_list_alloc. Let pid_list with no pid and
assign to tr->filtered_pids.
3. echo ' ' >> set_event_pid. Let pid_list is NULL and assign to
   tr->filtered_pids.
4. echo 9 >> set_event_pid, will trigger the double register
   sched_switch tracepoint warning.

The reason is that syzkaller injects a fault into the chunk allocation
in trace_pid_list_alloc, causing a failure in trace_pid_list_set, which
may trigger double register of the same tracepoint. This only occurs
when the system is about to crash, but to suppress this warning, let's
add failure handling logic to trace_pid_list_set."					
CVE-2025-39915	2025-10-01T08:15:34.647	2025-10-02T19:12:17.160	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: phy: transfer phy_config_inband() locking responsibility to phylink

Problem description
===================

Lockdep reports a possible circular locking dependency (AB/BA) between
&pl->state_mutex and &phy->lock, as follows.

phylink_resolve() // acquires &pl->state_mutex
-> phylink_major_config()
   -> phy_config_inband() // acquires &pl->phydev->lock

whereas all the other call sites where &pl->state_mutex and
&pl->phydev->lock have the locking scheme reversed. Everywhere else,
&pl->phydev->lock is acquired at the top level, and &pl->state_mutex at
the lower level. A clear example is phylink_bringup_phy().

The outlier is the newly introduced phy_config_inband() and the existing
lock order is the correct one. To understand why it cannot be the other
way around, it is sufficient to consider phylink_phy_change(), phylink's
callback from the PHY device's phy->phy_link_change() virtual method,
invoked by the PHY state machine.

phy_link_up() and phy_link_down(), the (indirect) callers of
phylink_phy_change(), are called with &phydev->lock acquired.
Then phylink_phy_change() acquires its own &pl->state_mutex, to
serialize changes made to its pl->phy_state and pl->link_config.
So all other instances of &pl->state_mutex and &phydev->lock must be
consistent with this order.

Problem impact
==============

I think the kernel runs a serious deadlock risk if an existing
phylink_resolve() thread, which results in a phy_config_inband() call,
is concurrent with a phy_link_up() or phy_link_down() call, which will
deadlock on &pl->state_mutex in phylink_phy_change(). Practically
speaking, the impact may be limited by the slow speed of the medium
auto-negotiation protocol, which makes it unlikely for the current state
to still be unresolved when a new one is detected, but I think the
problem is there. Nonetheless, the problem was discovered using lockdep.

Proposed solution
=================

Practically speaking, the phy_config_inband() requirement of having
phydev->lock acquired must transfer to the caller (phylink is the only
caller). There, it must bubble up until immediately before
&pl->state_mutex is acquired, for the cases where that takes place.

Solution details, considerations, notes

dmaengine: qcom: bam_dma: Fix DT error handling for num-channels/ees

When we don't have a clock specified in the device tree, we have no way to
ensure the BAM is on. This is often the case for remotely-controlled or
remotely-powered BAM instances. In this case, we need to read num-channels
from the DT to have all the necessary information to complete probing.

However, at the moment invalid device trees without clock and without
num-channels still continue probing, because the error handling is missing
return statements. The driver will then later try to read the number of
channels from the registers. This is unsafe, because it relies on boot
firmware and lucky timing to succeed. Unfortunately, the lack of proper
error handling here has been abused for several Qualcomm SoCs upstream,
causing early boot crashes in several situations [1, 2].

Avoid these early crashes by erroring out when any of the required DT
properties are missing. Note that this will break some of the existing DTs
upstream (mainly BAM instances related to the crypto engine). However,
clearly these DTs have never been tested properly, since the error in the
kernel log was just ignored. It's safer to disable the crypto engine for
these broken DTBs.

ceph: fix race condition validating r_parent before applying state

Add validation to ensure the cached parent directory inode matches the
directory info in MDS replies. This prevents client-side race conditions
where concurrent operations (e.g. rename) cause r_parent to become stale
between request initiation and reply processing, which could lead to
applying state changes to incorrect directory inodes.

[ idryomov: folded a kerneldoc fixup and a follow-up fix from Alex to
  move CEPH_CAP_PIN reference when r_parent is updated:

  When the parent directory lock is not held, req->r_parent can become
  stale and is updated to point to the correct inode.  However, the
  associated CEPH_CAP_PIN reference was not being adjusted.  The
  CEPH_CAP_PIN is a reference on an inode that is tracked for
  accounting purposes.  Moving this pin is important to keep the
  accounting balanced. When the pin was not moved from the old parent
  to the new one, it created two problems: The reference on the old,
  stale parent was never released, causing a reference leak.
  A reference for the new parent was never acquired, creating the risk
  of a reference underflow later in ceph_mdsc_release_request().  This
  patch corrects the logic by releasing the pin from the old parent and
  acquiring it for the new parent when r_parent is switched.  This
  ensures reference accounting stays balanced. ]"					
CVE-2025-39928	2025-10-01T08:15:36.230	2025-10-02T19:12:17.160	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: rtl9300: ensure data length is within supported range

Add an explicit check for the xfer length to 'rtl9300_i2c_config_xfer'
to ensure the data length isn't within the supported range. In
particular a data length of 0 is not supported by the hardware and
causes unintended or destructive behaviour.

This limitation becomes obvious when looking at the register
documentation [1]. 4 bits are reserved for DATA_WIDTH and the value
of these 4 bits is used as N + 1, allowing a data length range of
1 <= len <= 16.

Affected by this is the SMBus Quick Operation which works with a data
length of 0. Passing 0 as the length causes an underflow of the value
due to:

(len - 1) & 0xf

and effectively specifying a transfer length of 16 via the registers.
This causes a 16-byte write operation instead of a Quick Write. For
example, on SFP modules without write-protected EEPROM this soft-bricks
them by overwriting some initial bytes.

For completeness, also add a quirk for the zero length.

ext4: fix off-by-one errors in fast-commit block filling

Due to several different off-by-one errors, or perhaps due to a late
change in design that wasn't fully reflected in the code that was
actually merged, there are several very strange constraints on how
fast-commit blocks are filled with tlv entries:

- tlvs must start at least 10 bytes before the end of the block, even
  though the minimum tlv length is 8.  Otherwise, the replay code will
  ignore them.  (BUG: ext4_fc_reserve_space() could violate this
  requirement if called with a len of blocksize - 9 or blocksize - 8.
  Fortunately, this doesn't seem to happen currently.)

- tlvs must end at least 1 byte before the end of the block.  Otherwise
  the replay code will consider them to be invalid.  This quirk
  contributed to a bug (fixed by an earlier commit) where uninitialized
  memory was being leaked to disk in the last byte of blocks.

Also, strangely these constraints don't apply to the replay code in
e2fsprogs, which will accept any tlvs in the blocks (with no bounds
checks at all, but that is a separate issue...).

Given that this all seems to be a bug, let's fix it by just filling
blocks with tlv entries in the natural way.

Note that old kernels will be unable to replay fast-commit journals
created by kernels that have this commit."

Amadeusz reports KASAN use-after-free errors introduced by commit
3881ee0b1edc (""efi: avoid efivars layer when loading SSDTs from

new ACPI table is now freed unconditionally, instead of only when the
ACPI core reported a failure to load the table.

So let's fix this, by omitting the kfree() on success."

ext4: avoid crash when inline data creation follows DIO write

When inode is created and written to using direct IO, there is nothing
to clear the EXT4_STATE_MAY_INLINE_DATA flag. Thus when inode gets
truncated later to say 1 byte and written using normal write, we will
try to store the data as inline data. This confuses the code later
because the inode now has both normal block and inline data allocated
and the confusion manifests for example as:

ARC: mm: fix leakage of memory allocated for PTE

Since commit d9820ff (""ARC: mm: switch pgtable_t back to struct page *"")
a memory leakage problem occurs. Memory allocated for page table entries
not released during process termination. This issue can be reproduced by
a small program that allocates a large amount of memory. After several
runs, you'll see that the amount of free memory has reduced and will
continue to reduce after each run. All ARC CPUs are effected by this
issue. The issue was introduced since the kernel stable release v5.15-rc1.

As described in commit d9820ff after switch pgtable_t back to struct
page *, a pointer to ""struct page"" and appropriate functions are used to
allocate and free a memory page for PTEs, but the pmd_pgtable macro hasn't
changed and returns the direct virtual address from the PMD (PGD) entry.
Than this address used as a parameter in the __pte_free() and as a result
this function couldn't release memory page allocated for PTEs.

Fix this issue by changing the pmd_pgtable macro and returning pointer to
struct page."

There are several places where we can crash the kernel by requesting
lines, unbinding the GPIO device, then calling any of the system calls
relevant to the GPIO character device's annonymous file descriptors:
ioctl(), read(), poll().

While I observed it with the GPIO simulator, it will also happen for any
of the GPIO devices that can be hot-unplugged - for instance any HID GPIO
expander (e.g. CP2112).

This affects both v1 and v2 uAPI.

doesn't entirely remedy the situation as we still have a race condition

mtd: core: Fix refcount error in del_mtd_device()

del_mtd_device() will call of_node_put() to mtd_get_of_node(mtd), which

of_node_put(). As the result, of_node_put() won't do anything in

scsi: iscsi: iscsi_tcp: Fix null-ptr-deref while calling getpeername()

Fix a NULL pointer crash that occurs when we are freeing the socket at the
same time we access it via sysfs.

The problem is that:

 1. iscsi_sw_tcp_conn_get_param() and iscsi_sw_tcp_host_get_param() take
    the frwd_lock and do sock_hold() then drop the frwd_lock. sock_hold()
    does a get on the ""struct sock"".

 2. iscsi_sw_tcp_release_conn() does sockfd_put() which does the last put
    on the ""struct socket"" and that does __sock_release() which sets the
    sock->ops to NULL.

 3. iscsi_sw_tcp_conn_get_param() and iscsi_sw_tcp_host_get_param() then
    call kernel_getpeername() which accesses the NULL sock->ops.

Above we do a get on the ""struct sock"", but we needed a get on the ""struct
socket"". Originally, we just held the frwd_lock the entire time but in
commit bcf3a2953d36 (""scsi: iscsi: iscsi_tcp: Avoid holding spinlock while
calling getpeername()"") we switched to refcount based because the network
layer changed and started taking a mutex in that path, so we could no
longer hold the frwd_lock.

Instead of trying to maintain multiple refcounts, this just has us use a
mutex for accessing the socket in the interface code paths."

io_uring: wait interruptibly for request completions on exit

WHen the ring exits, cleanup is done and the final cancelation and
waiting on completions is done by io_ring_exit_work. That function is
invoked by kworker, which doesn't take any signals. Because of that, it
doesn't really matter if we wait for completions in TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE
or TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE state. However, it does matter to the hung task
detection checker!

Normally we expect cancelations and completions to happen rather
quickly. Some test cases, however, will exit the ring and park the
owning task stopped (eg via SIGSTOP). If the owning task needs to run
task_work to complete requests, then io_ring_exit_work won't make any
progress until the task is runnable again. Hence io_ring_exit_work can
trigger the hung task detection, which is particularly problematic if
panic-on-hung-task is enabled.

As the ring exit doesn't take signals to begin with, have it wait
interruptibly rather than uninterruptibly. io_uring has a separate
stuck-exit warning that triggers independently anyway, so we're not
really missing anything by making this switch."

ibmvnic: Do not reset dql stats on NON_FATAL err

All ibmvnic resets, make a call to netdev_tx_reset_queue() when
re-opening the device. netdev_tx_reset_queue() resets the num_queued
and num_completed byte counters. These stats are used in Byte Queue
Limit (BQL) algorithms. The difference between these two stats tracks
the number of bytes currently sitting on the physical NIC. ibmvnic
increases the number of queued bytes though calls to
netdev_tx_sent_queue() in the drivers xmit function. When, VIOS reports
that it is done transmitting bytes, the ibmvnic device increases the
number of completed bytes through calls to netdev_tx_completed_queue().
It is important to note that the driver batches its transmit calls and
num_queued is increased every time that an skb is added to the next
batch, not necessarily when the batch is sent to VIOS for transmission.

Unlike other reset types, a NON FATAL reset will not flush the sub crq
tx buffers. Therefore, it is possible for the batched skb array to be
partially full. So if there is call to netdev_tx_reset_queue() when
re-opening the device, the value of num_queued (0) would not account
for the skb's that are currently batched. Eventually, when the batch
is sent to VIOS, the call to netdev_tx_completed_queue() would increase
num_completed to a value greater than the num_queued. This causes a
BUG_ON crash:

Bing-Jhong Billy Jheng reported null-ptr-deref in unix_stream_sendpage()

unix_stream_sendpage() tries to add data to the last skb in the peer's

If the peer's FD is passed to another socket and the socket's FD is
passed to the peer, there is a loop between them.  If we close both

collection.

The garbage collection iterates such sockets and unlinks skb with
FD from the socket's receive queue under the queue's lock.

So, there is a race where unix_stream_sendpage() could access an skb
locklessly that is being released by garbage collection, resulting in
use-after-free.

To avoid the issue, unix_stream_sendpage() must lock the peer's recv
queue.

Note the issue does not exist in 6.5+ thanks to the recent sendpage()
refactoring.

This patch is originally written by Linus Torvalds.

lib: cpu_rmap: Avoid use after free on rmap->obj array entries

When calling irq_set_affinity_notifier() with NULL at the notify
argument, it will cause freeing of the glue pointer in the
corresponding array entry but will leave the pointer in the array. A
subsequent call to free_irq_cpu_rmap() will try to free this entry again
leading to possible use after free.

Fix that by setting NULL to the array entry and checking that we have
non-zero at the array entry when iterating over the array in
free_irq_cpu_rmap().

The current code does not suffer from this since there are no cases
where irq_set_affinity_notifier(irq, NULL) (note the NULL passed for the
notify arg) is called, followed by a call to free_irq_cpu_rmap() so we
don't hit and issue. Subsequent patches in this series excersize this

The bug occurs when the dbAllocDmapLev()function attempts to access
dp->tree.stree[leafidx + LEAFIND] while the leafidx value is negative.

To rectify this, the patch introduces a safeguard within the
dbAllocDmapLev() function. A check has been added to verify if leafidx is
negative. If it is, the function immediately returns an I/O error, preventing
any further execution that could potentially cause harm.

tcp/udp: Fix memleaks of sk and zerocopy skbs with TX timestamp.

syzkaller reported [0] memory leaks of an UDP socket and ZEROCOPY
skbs.  We can reproduce the problem with these sequences:

  sk = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0)
  sk.setsockopt(SOL_SOCKET, SO_TIMESTAMPING, SOF_TIMESTAMPING_TX_SOFTWARE)
  sk.setsockopt(SOL_SOCKET, SO_ZEROCOPY, 1)
  sk.sendto(b'', MSG_ZEROCOPY, ('127.0.0.1', 53))
  sk.close()

sendmsg() calls msg_zerocopy_alloc(), which allocates a skb, sets
skb->cb->ubuf.refcnt to 1, and calls sock_hold().  Here, struct
ubuf_info_msgzc indirectly holds a refcnt of the socket.  When the
skb is sent, __skb_tstamp_tx() clones it and puts the clone into
the socket's error queue with the TX timestamp.

When the original skb is received locally, skb_copy_ubufs() calls
skb_unclone(), and pskb_expand_head() increments skb->cb->ubuf.refcnt.
This additional count is decremented while freeing the skb, but struct
ubuf_info_msgzc still has a refcnt, so __msg_zerocopy_callback() is
not called.

The last refcnt is not released unless we retrieve the TX timestamped
skb by recvmsg().  Since we clear the error queue in inet_sock_destruct()
after the socket's refcnt reaches 0, there is a circular dependency.
If we close() the socket holding such skbs, we never call sock_put()
and leak the count, sk, and skb.

TCP has the same problem, and commit e0c8bccd40fc (""net: stream:
purge sk_error_queue in sk_stream_kill_queues()"") tried to fix it
by calling skb_queue_purge() during close().  However, there is a
small chance that skb queued in a qdisc or device could be put
into the error queue after the skb_queue_purge() call.

In __skb_tstamp_tx(), the cloned skb should not have a reference
to the ubuf to remove the circular dependency, but skb_clone() does
not call skb_copy_ubufs() for zerocopy skb.  So, we need to call
skb_orphan_frags_rx() for the cloned skb to call skb_copy_ubufs().

CVE-2023-53490	2025-10-01T12:15:52.107	2025-10-02T19:12:17.160	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: fix disconnect vs accept race

Despite commit 0ad529d9fd2b (""mptcp: fix possible divide by zero in
recvmsg()""), the mptcp protocol is still prone to a race between
disconnect() (or shutdown) and accept.

The root cause is that the mentioned commit checks the msk-level
flag, but mptcp_stream_accept() does acquire the msk-level lock,
as it can rely directly on the first subflow lock.

As reported by Christoph than can lead to a race where an msk
socket is accepted after that mptcp_subflow_queue_clean() releases
the listener socket lock and just before it takes destructive
actions leading to the following splat:

start_kernel: Add __no_stack_protector function attribute

Back during the discussion of
commit a9a3ed1eff36 (""x86: Fix early boot crash on gcc-10, third try"")
we discussed the need for a function attribute to control the omission
of stack protectors on a per-function basis; at the time Clang had
support for no_stack_protector but GCC did not. This was fixed in
gcc-11. Now that the function attribute is available, let's start using
it.

Callers of boot_init_stack_canary need to use this function attribute
unless they're compiled with -fno-stack-protector, otherwise the canary
stored in the stack slot of the caller will differ upon the call to
boot_init_stack_canary. This will lead to a call to __stack_chk_fail()
then panic."

The UV code attempts to build a set of tables to allow it to do

cpu_to_node() mapping information for unused CPUs is not available to
build_socket_tables(). This results in skipping some nodes or sockets

over, causing oopses.

The problem is that the socket<=>node lookups are created by doing a
loop over all CPUs, then looking up the CPU's APICID and socket. But
if a CPU is not present, there is no way to start this lookup.

Instead of looping over all CPUs, take CPUs out of the equation
entirely. Loop over all APICIDs which are mapped to a valid NUMA node.
Then just extract the socket-id from the APICID.

The vsp1 driver uses the vb2_is_streaming() function in its .buf_queue()

and decide whether to just add the buffer to an internal queue, or also
trigger a hardware run. vb2_is_streaming() relies on the vb2_queue

Commit a10b21532574 (""media: vb2: add (un)prepare_streaming queue ops"")

When unbinding pasid - a race condition exists vs outstanding page faults.

CVE-2023-53503	2025-10-01T12:15:53.917	2025-10-02T19:11:46.753	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: allow ext4_get_group_info() to fail

Previously, ext4_get_group_info() would treat an invalid group number
as BUG(), since in theory it should never happen.  However, if a
malicious attaker (or fuzzer) modifies the superblock via the block
device while it is the file system is mounted, it is possible for
s_first_data_block to get set to a very large number.  In that case,
when calculating the block group of some block number (such as the
starting block of a preallocation region), could result in an
underflow and very large block group number.  Then the BUG_ON check in
ext4_get_group_info() would fire, resutling in a denial of service
attack that can be triggered by root or someone with write access to
the block device.

For a quality of implementation perspective, it's best that even if
the system administrator does something that they shouldn't, that it
will not trigger a BUG.  So instead of BUG'ing, ext4_get_group_info()
will call ext4_error and return NULL.  We also add fallback code in
all of the callers of ext4_get_group_info() that it might NULL.

Also, since ext4_get_group_info() was already borderline to be an
inline function, un-inline it.  The results in a next reduction of the
compiled text size of ext4 by roughly 2k."

qed: allow sleep in qed_mcp_trace_dump()

By default, qed_mcp_cmd_and_union() delays 10us at a time in a loop
that can run 500K times, so calls to qed_mcp_nvm_rd_cmd()
may block the current thread for over 5s.
We observed thread scheduling delays over 700ms in production,
with stacktraces pointing to this code as the culprit.

qed_mcp_trace_dump() is called from ethtool, so sleeping is permitted.
It already can sleep in qed_mcp_halt(), which calls qed_mcp_cmd().
Add a ""can sleep"" parameter to qed_find_nvram_image() and
qed_nvram_read() so they can sleep during qed_mcp_trace_dump().
qed_mcp_trace_get_meta_info() and qed_mcp_trace_read_meta(),
called only by qed_mcp_trace_dump(), allow these functions to sleep.
I can't tell if the other caller (qed_grc_dump_mcp_hw_dump()) can sleep,
so keep b_can_sleep set to false when it calls these functions.

can: gs_usb: fix time stamp counter initialization

If the gs_usb device driver is unloaded (or unbound) before the
interface is shut down, the USB stack first calls the struct
usb_driver::disconnect and then the struct net_device_ops::ndo_stop
callback.

In gs_usb_disconnect() all pending bulk URBs are killed, i.e. no more
RX'ed CAN frames are send from the USB device to the host. Later in
gs_can_close() a reset control message is send to each CAN channel to
remove the controller from the CAN bus. In this race window the USB
device can still receive CAN frames from the bus and internally queue
them to be send to the host.

At least in the current version of the candlelight firmware, the queue
of received CAN frames is not emptied during the reset command. After
loading (or binding) the gs_usb driver, new URBs are submitted during
the struct net_device_ops::ndo_open callback and the candlelight
firmware starts sending its already queued CAN frames to the host.

However, this scenario was not considered when implementing the
hardware timestamp function. The cycle counter/time counter
infrastructure is set up (gs_usb_timestamp_init()) after the USBs are
submitted, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference if
timecounter_cyc2time() (via the call chain:
gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback() -> gs_usb_set_timestamp() ->
gs_usb_skb_set_timestamp()) is called too early.

Move the gs_usb_timestamp_init() function before the URBs are
submitted to fix this problem.

For a comprehensive solution, we need to consider gs_usb devices with
more than 1 channel. The cycle counter/time counter infrastructure is
setup per channel, but the RX URBs are per device. Once gs_can_open()
of _a_ channel has been called, and URBs have been submitted, the
gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback() can be called for _all_ available
channels, even for channels that are not running, yet. As cycle
counter/time counter has not set up, this will again lead to a NULL
pointer dereference.

Convert the cycle counter/time counter from a ""per channel"" to a ""per
device"" functionality. Also set it up, before submitting any URBs to
the device.

Further in gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(), don't process any URBs for
not started CAN channels, only resubmit the URB."

null_blk: fix poll request timeout handling

When doing io_uring benchmark on /dev/nullb0, it's easy to crash the
kernel if poll requests timeout triggered, as reported by David. [1]

BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000008

This is indeed a race problem between null_timeout_rq() and null_poll().

null_poll()				null_timeout_rq()
  spin_lock(&nq->poll_lock)
  list_splice_init(&nq->poll_list, &list)
  spin_unlock(&nq->poll_lock)

  while (!list_empty(&list))
    req = list_first_entry()
    list_del_init()
    ...
    blk_mq_add_to_batch()
    // req->rq_next = NULL
					spin_lock(&nq->poll_lock)

					// rq->queuelist->next == NULL
					list_del_init(&rq->queuelist)

					spin_unlock(&nq->poll_lock)

Fix these problems by setting requests state to MQ_RQ_COMPLETE under
nq->poll_lock protection, in which null_timeout_rq() can safely detect
this race and early return.

Note this patch just fix the kernel panic when request timeout happen.

wifi: ath11k: fix deinitialization of firmware resources

Currently, in ath11k_ahb_fw_resources_init(), iommu domain
mapping is done only for the chipsets having fixed firmware
memory. Also, for such chipsets, mapping is done only if it
does not have TrustZone support.

During deinitialization, only if TrustZone support is not there,
iommu is unmapped back. However, for non fixed firmware memory
chipsets, TrustZone support is not there and this makes the
condition check to true and it tries to unmap the memory which
was not mapped during initialization.

This leads to the following trace -

This can be reproduced by probing an AHB chipset which is not
having a fixed memory region. During reboot (or rmmod) trace
can be seen.

Fix this issue by adding a condition check on firmware fixed memory
hw_param as done in the counter initialization function.

This issue can be triggered remotely without authentication by starting the same server multiple times or if the server exits unexpectedly. The vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) against the PLC runtime, stopping any PC started remotely without authentication. This results in the PLC process crashing and halting all automation or control logic managed by OpenPLC.	7.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2025-59951	2025-10-01T22:15:31.683	2025-10-06T19:15:35.500	Termix is a web-based server management platform with SSH terminal, tunneling, and file editing capabilities. The official Docker image  for Termix versions 1.5.0 and below, due to being configured with an Nginx reverse proxy, causes the backend to retrieve the proxy's IP instead of the client's IP when using the req.ip method. This results in isLocalhost always returning True. Consequently, the /ssh/db/host/internal endpoint can be accessed directly without login or authentication. This endpoint records the system's stored SSH host information, including addresses, usernames, and passwords, posing an extremely high security risk. Users who use the official Termix docker image, build their own image using the official dockerfile, or utilize reverse proxy functionality will be affected by this vulnerability. This issue is fixed in version 1.6.0.					
CVE-2025-61587	2025-10-01T22:15:31.853	2025-10-07T14:26:18.117	Weblate is a web based localization tool. An open redirect exists in versions 5.13.2 and below via the redir parameter on .within.website when Weblate is configured with Anubis and REDIRECT_DOMAINS is not set. An attacker can craft a URL on the legitimate domain that redirects a victim to an attacker-controlled site. The redirect can also be used to initiate drive-by downloads (redirecting to a URL that serves a malicious file), increasing the risk to end users. This issue is fixed in version 5.13.3.	6.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N		
CVE-2025-61582	2025-10-01T23:15:30.340	2025-10-02T19:11:46.753	TS3 Manager is modern web interface for maintaining Teamspeak3 servers. A Denial of Dervice vulnerability has been identified in versions 2.2.1 and earlier. The vulnerability permits an unauthenticated actor to crash the application through the submission of specially crafted Unicode input, requiring no prior authentication or privileges. The flaw manifests when Unicode tag characters are submitted to the Server field on the login page. The application fails to properly handle these characters during the ASCII conversion process, resulting in an unhandled exception that terminates the application within four to five seconds of submission. This issue is fixed in version 2.2.2.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

A reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability has been identified in versions 2.2.1 and earlier. The vulnerability exists in the error handling mechanism of the login page, where malicious scripts embedded in server hostnames are executed in the victim's browser context without proper sanitization. This issue is fixed in version 2.2.2.	4.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2025-61588	2025-10-02T00:15:49.890	2025-10-02T19:11:46.753	RISC Zero is a zero-knowledge verifiable general computing platform based on zk-STARKs and the RISC-V microarchitecture. In versions 2.0.2 and below of risc0-zkvm-platform, when the zkVM guest calls sys_read, the host is able to use a crafted response to write to an arbitrary memory location in the guest. This capability can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code within the guest. As sys_read is the mechanism by which input is requested by the guest, all guest programs built with the affected versions are vulnerable. This critically compromises the soundness guarantees of the guest program. Other affected packages include risc0-aggregation versions below 0.9,  risc0-zkos-v1compat below 2.1.0, risc0-zkvm versions between 3.0.0-rc.1 and 3.0.1. This issue has been fixed in the following versions: risc0-zkvm-platform 2.1.0, risc0-zkos-v1compat 2.1.0, risc0-aggregation 0.9, and risc0-zkvm 2.3.2 and 3.0.3.

The hashing is performed via PHP's `hash()` function in multiple files (server_write_requests_users.php, update_database.php, legacy/Login.php, tests/Unit/Api/IdpControllerTest.php). No per-user salt is used and the fast hash algorithms are unsuitable for password storage. An attacker who obtains the password database can recover cleartext passwords via offline dictionary or rainbow table attacks. The vulnerable code also contains logic that migrates legacy SHA-1 hashes to SHA-512 on login, further exposing users still on the old hash. This vulnerability was partially resolved, but still present within the legacy authentication platform.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVE-2025-59536	2025-10-03T07:15:44.550	2025-10-06T14:57:05.000	Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. Versions before 1.0.111 were vulnerable to Code Injection due to a bug in the startup trust dialog implementation. Claude Code could be tricked to execute code contained in a project before the user accepted the startup trust dialog. Exploiting this requires a user to start Claude Code in an untrusted directory. Users on standard Claude Code auto-update will have received this fix automatically. Users performing manual updates are advised to update to the latest version. This issue is fixed in version 1.0.111.					
CVE-2025-61589	2025-10-03T07:15:45.470	2025-10-06T14:57:05.000	Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions 1.6 and below, Mermaid (a to render diagrams) allows embedding images which then get rendered by Cursor in the chat box. An attacker can use this to exfiltrate sensitive information to a third-party attacker controlled server through an image fetch after successfully performing a prompt injection. A malicious model (or hallucination/backdoor) might also trigger this exploit at will. This issue requires prompt injection from malicious data (web, image upload, source code) in order to exploit. In that case, it can send sensitive information to an attacker-controlled external server. Some additional bypasses not covered in the initial fix to this issue were discovered, see GHSA-43wj-mwcc-x93p.

Workspaces allow users to open more than a single folder and save specific settings (pretty similar to .vscode/settings.json) for the folders / project. An untitled workspace is automatically created by VS Code (untitled.code-workspace), which contains all the folders and workspace settings from the user's current session, opening up an entire new attack vector if the user has a .code-workspace file in path (either untitled created automatically or a saved one). If an attacker is able to hijack the chat context of the victim (such as via a compromised MCP server), they can use prompt injection to make the Cursor Agent write into this file and modify the workspace. This leads to a bypass of CVE-2025-54130 which can lead to RCE by writing to the settings section. This issue is fixed in version 1.7.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2025-61591	2025-10-03T17:15:47.853	2025-10-06T14:56:47.823	Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions 1.7 and below, when MCP uses OAuth authentication with an untrusted MCP server, an attacker can impersonate a malicious MCP server and return crafted, maliciously injected commands during the interaction process, leading to command injection and potential remote code execution. If chained with an untrusted MCP service via OAuth, this command injection vulnerability could allow arbitrary code execution on the host by the agent. This can then be used to directly compromise the system by executing malicious commands with full user privileges. This issue does not currently have a fixed release version, but there is a patch, 2025.09.17-25b418f.	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

octeontx2-pf: Fix use-after-free bugs in otx2_sync_tstamp()

The original code relies on cancel_delayed_work() in otx2_ptp_destroy(),
which does not ensure that the delayed work item synctstamp_work has fully
completed if it was already running. This leads to use-after-free scenarios
where otx2_ptp is deallocated by otx2_ptp_destroy(), while synctstamp_work
remains active and attempts to dereference otx2_ptp in otx2_sync_tstamp().
Furthermore, the synctstamp_work is cyclic, the likelihood of triggering
the bug is nonnegligible.

A typical race condition is illustrated below:

CPU 0 (cleanup)           | CPU 1 (delayed work callback)
otx2_remove()             |
  otx2_ptp_destroy()      | otx2_sync_tstamp()

CVE-2025-39945	2025-10-04T08:15:47.613	2025-10-06T14:56:47.823	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cnic: Fix use-after-free bugs in cnic_delete_task

The original code uses cancel_delayed_work() in cnic_cm_stop_bnx2x_hw(),
which does not guarantee that the delayed work item 'delete_task' has
fully completed if it was already running. Additionally, the delayed work
item is cyclic, the flush_workqueue() in cnic_cm_stop_bnx2x_hw() only
blocks and waits for work items that were already queued to the
workqueue prior to its invocation. Any work items submitted after
flush_workqueue() is called are not included in the set of tasks that the
flush operation awaits. This means that after the cyclic work items have
finished executing, a delayed work item may still exist in the workqueue.
This leads to use-after-free scenarios where the cnic_dev is deallocated
by cnic_free_dev(), while delete_task remains active and attempt to
dereference cnic_dev in cnic_delete_task().

A typical race condition is illustrated below:

CPU 0 (cleanup)              | CPU 1 (delayed work callback)
cnic_netdev_event()          |
  cnic_stop_hw()             | cnic_delete_task()
    cnic_cm_stop_bnx2x_hw()  | ...
      cancel_delayed_work()  | /* the queue_delayed_work()
      flush_workqueue()      |    executes after flush_workqueue()*/
                             | queue_delayed_work()
  cnic_free_dev(dev)//free   | cnic_delete_task() //new instance
                             |   dev = cp->dev; //use

Replace cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() to ensure
that the cyclic delayed work item is properly canceled and that any
ongoing execution of the work item completes before the cnic_dev is
deallocated. Furthermore, since cancel_delayed_work_sync() uses
__flush_work(work, true) to synchronously wait for any currently
executing instance of the work item to finish, the flush_workqueue()
becomes redundant and should be removed.

This bug was identified through static analysis. To reproduce the issue
and validate the fix, I simulated the cnic PCI device in QEMU and
introduced intentional delays — such as inserting calls to ssleep()
within the cnic_delete_task() function — to increase the likelihood
of triggering the bug."

tls: make sure to abort the stream if headers are bogus

Normally we wait for the socket to buffer up the whole record

we read out the data sooner, to prevent connection stalls.
Make sure that we abort the connection when we find out late
that the record is actually invalid. Retrying the parsing is
fine in itself but since we copy some more data each time
before we parse we can overflow the allocated skb space.

Constructing a scenario in which we're under pressure without
enough data in the socket to parse the length upfront is quite
hard. syzbot figured out a way to do this by serving us the header
in small OOB sends, and then filling in the recvbuf with a large

CVE-2025-39948	2025-10-04T08:15:47.990	2025-10-06T14:56:47.823	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: fix Rx page leak on multi-buffer frames

The ice_put_rx_mbuf() function handles calling ice_put_rx_buf() for each
buffer in the current frame. This function was introduced as part of
handling multi-buffer XDP support in the ice driver.

It works by iterating over the buffers from first_desc up to 1 plus the
total number of fragments in the frame, cached from before the XDP program
was executed.

If the hardware posts a descriptor with a size of 0, the logic used in
ice_put_rx_mbuf() breaks. Such descriptors get skipped and don't get added
as fragments in ice_add_xdp_frag. Since the buffer isn't counted as a
fragment, we do not iterate over it in ice_put_rx_mbuf(), and thus we don't
call ice_put_rx_buf().

Because we don't call ice_put_rx_buf(), we don't attempt to re-use the
page or free it. This leaves a stale page in the ring, as we don't
increment next_to_alloc.

The ice_reuse_rx_page() assumes that the next_to_alloc has been incremented
properly, and that it always points to a buffer with a NULL page. Since
this function doesn't check, it will happily recycle a page over the top
of the next_to_alloc buffer, losing track of the old page.

Note that this leak only occurs for multi-buffer frames. The
ice_put_rx_mbuf() function always handles at least one buffer, so a
single-buffer frame will always get handled correctly. It is not clear
precisely why the hardware hands us descriptors with a size of 0 sometimes,
but it happens somewhat regularly with ""jumbo frames"" used by 9K MTU.

To fix ice_put_rx_mbuf(), we need to make sure to call ice_put_rx_buf() on
all buffers between first_desc and next_to_clean. Borrow the logic of a
similar function in i40e used for this same purpose. Use the same logic
also in ice_get_pgcnts().

Instead of iterating over just the number of fragments, use a loop which
iterates until the current index reaches to the next_to_clean element just
past the current frame. Unlike i40e, the ice_put_rx_mbuf() function does
call ice_put_rx_buf() on the last buffer of the frame indicating the end of
packet.

For non-linear (multi-buffer) frames, we need to take care when adjusting
the pagecnt_bias. An XDP program might release fragments from the tail of
the frame, in which case that fragment page is already released. Only
update the pagecnt_bias for the first descriptor and fragments still
remaining post-XDP program. Take care to only access the shared info for
fragmented buffers, as this avoids a significant cache miss.

The xdp_xmit value only needs to be updated if an XDP program is run, and
only once per packet. Drop the xdp_xmit pointer argument from
ice_put_rx_mbuf(). Instead, set xdp_xmit in the ice_clean_rx_irq() function
directly. This avoids needing to pass the argument and avoids an extra
bit-wise OR for each buffer in the frame.

Move the increment of the ntc local variable to ensure its updated *before*
all calls to ice_get_pgcnts() or ice_put_rx_mbuf(), as the loop logic
requires the index of the element just after the current frame.

Now that we use an index pointer in the ring to identify the packet, we no
longer need to track or cache the number of fragments in the rx_ring."

3. A dying perf_event CSS gets queued for offline after root destruction
4. Root destruction waits for offline completion, but offline work is
   blocked behind root destruction in cgroup_destroy_wq (max_active=1)

Solution:
Split cgroup_destroy_wq into three dedicated workqueues:
cgroup_offline_wq – Handles CSS offline operations
cgroup_release_wq – Manages resource release
cgroup_free_wq – Performs final memory deallocation

This separation eliminates blocking in the CSS free path while waiting for
offline operations to complete.

For each munmap() call, the Xen hypervisor (if built with CONFIG_DEBUG)
would print out the following and trigger a general protection fault in
the affected Xen PV domain:

  (XEN) d0v... Attempt to implicitly unmap d0's grant PTE ...
  (XEN) d0v... Attempt to implicitly unmap d0's grant PTE ...

As of this writing, gntdev_grant_map structure's vma field (referred to
as map->vma below) is mainly used for checking the start and end
addresses of mappings. However, with split VMAs, these may change, and
there could be more than one VMA associated with a gntdev mapping.
Hence, remove the use of map->vma and rely on map->pages_vm_start for
the original start address and on (map->count << PAGE_SHIFT) for the
original mapping size. Let the invalidate() and find_special_page()
hooks use these.

Also, given that there can be multiple VMAs associated with a gntdev
mapping, move the ""mmu_interval_notifier_remove(&map->notifier)"" call to
the end of gntdev_put_map, so that the MMU notifier is only removed
after the closing of the last remaining VMA.

Finally, use an atomic to prevent inadvertent gntdev mapping re-use,
instead of using the map->live_grants atomic counter and/or the map->vma
pointer (the latter of which is now removed). This prevents the
userspace from mmap()'ing (with MAP_FIXED) a gntdev mapping over the
same address range as a previously set up gntdev mapping. This scenario
can be summarized with the following call-trace, which was valid prior
to this commit:

  mmap
    gntdev_mmap
  mmap (repeat mmap with MAP_FIXED over the same address range)
    gntdev_invalidate
      unmap_grant_pages (sets 'being_removed' entries to true)

ntb_netdev: Use dev_kfree_skb_any() in interrupt context

TX/RX callback handlers (ntb_netdev_tx_handler(),
ntb_netdev_rx_handler()) can be called in interrupt
context via the DMA framework when the respective
DMA operations have completed. As such, any calls
by these routines to free skb's, should use the
interrupt context safe dev_kfree_skb_any() function.

Previously, these callback handlers would call the
interrupt unsafe version of dev_kfree_skb(). This has
not presented an issue on Intel IOAT DMA engines as
that driver utilizes tasklets rather than a hard
interrupt handler, like the AMD PTDMA DMA driver.
On AMD systems, a kernel WARNING message is
encountered, which is being issued from
skb_release_head_state() due to in_hardirq()
being true.

Besides the user visible WARNING from the kernel,
the other symptom of this bug was that TCP/IP performance
across the ntb_netdev interface was very poor, i.e.
approximately an order of magnitude below what was
expected. With the repair to use dev_kfree_skb_any(),
kernel WARNINGs from skb_release_head_state() ceased
and TCP/IP performance, as measured by iperf, was on
par with expected results, approximately 20 Gb/s on

corrupted, nilfs_sb2_bad_offset helper function can trigger

net: enetc: avoid buffer leaks on xdp_do_redirect() failure

Before enetc_clean_rx_ring_xdp() calls xdp_do_redirect(), each software
BD in the RX ring between index orig_i and i can have one of 2 refcount
values on its page.

We are the owner of the current buffer that is being processed, so the
refcount will be at least 1.

If the current owner of the buffer at the diametrically opposed index
in the RX ring (i.o.w, the other half of this page) has not yet called
kfree(), this page's refcount could even be 2.

enetc_page_reusable() in enetc_flip_rx_buff() tests for the page
refcount against 1, and [ if it's 2 ] does not attempt to reuse it.

But if enetc_flip_rx_buff() is put after the xdp_do_redirect() call,
the page refcount can have one of 3 values. It can also be 0, if there
is no owner of the other page half, and xdp_do_redirect() for this
buffer ran so far that it triggered a flush of the devmap/cpumap bulk
queue, and the consumers of those bulk queues also freed the buffer,
all by the time xdp_do_redirect() returns the execution back to enetc.

This is the reason why enetc_flip_rx_buff() is called before
xdp_do_redirect(), but there is a big flaw with that reasoning:
enetc_flip_rx_buff() will set rx_swbd->page = NULL on both sides of the
enetc_page_reusable() branch, and if xdp_do_redirect() returns an error,
we call enetc_xdp_free(), which does not deal gracefully with that.

In fact, what happens is quite special. The page refcounts start as 1.
enetc_flip_rx_buff() figures they're reusable, transfers these
rx_swbd->page pointers to a different rx_swbd in enetc_reuse_page(), and
bumps the refcount to 2. When xdp_do_redirect() later returns an error,
we call the no-op enetc_xdp_free(), but we still haven't lost the
reference to that page. A copy of it is still at rx_ring->next_to_alloc,
but that has refcount 2 (and there are no concurrent owners of it in
flight, to drop the refcount). What really kills the system is when
we'll flip the rx_swbd->page the second time around. With an updated
refcount of 2, the page will not be reusable and we'll really leak it.
Then enetc_new_page() will have to allocate more pages, which will then
eventually leak again on further errors from xdp_do_redirect().

The problem, summarized, is that we zeroize rx_swbd->page before we're
completely done with it, and this makes it impossible for the error path
to do something with it.

Since the packet is potentially multi-buffer and therefore the
rx_swbd->page is potentially an array, manual passing of the old
pointers between enetc_flip_rx_buff() and enetc_xdp_free() is a bit
difficult.

For the sake of going with a simple solution, we accept the possibility
of racing with xdp_do_redirect(), and we move the flip procedure to
execute only on the redirect success path. By racing, I mean that the
page may be deemed as not reusable by enetc (having a refcount of 0),
but there will be no leak in that case, either.

Once we accept that, we have something better to do with buffers on
XDP_REDIRECT failure. Since we haven't performed half-page flipping yet,
we won't, either (and this way, we can avoid enetc_xdp_free()
completely, which gives the entire page to the slab allocator).
Instead, we'll call enetc_xdp_drop(), which will recycle this half of
the buffer back to the RX ring."

ext4: add EXT4_IGET_BAD flag to prevent unexpected bad inode

There are many places that will get unhappy (and crash) when ext4_iget()
returns a bad inode. However, if iget the boot loader inode, allows a bad
inode to be returned, because the inode may not be initialized. This
mechanism can be used to bypass some checks and cause panic. To solve this
problem, we add a special iget flag EXT4_IGET_BAD. Only with this flag
we'd be returning bad inode from ext4_iget(), otherwise we always return
the error code if the inode is bad inode.(suggested by Jan Kara)"

drbd: only clone bio if we have a backing device

Commit c347a787e34cb (drbd: set ->bi_bdev in drbd_req_new) moved a
bio_set_dev call (which has since been removed) to ""earlier"", from
drbd_request_prepare to drbd_req_new.

The problem is that this accesses device->ldev->backing_bdev, which is
not NULL-checked at this point. When we don't have an ldev (i.e. when
the DRBD device is diskless), this leads to a null pointer deref.

So, only allocate the private_bio if we actually have a disk. This is
also a small optimization, since we don't clone the bio to only to
immediately free it again in the diskless case."

blk-crypto: make blk_crypto_evict_key() more robust

If blk_crypto_evict_key() sees that the key is still in-use (due to a
bug) or that ->keyslot_evict failed, it currently just returns while
leaving the key linked into the keyslot management structures.

However, blk_crypto_evict_key() is only called in contexts such as inode
eviction where failure is not an option.  So actually the caller
proceeds with freeing the blk_crypto_key regardless of the return value
of blk_crypto_evict_key().

These two assumptions don't match, and the result is that there can be a
use-after-free in blk_crypto_reprogram_all_keys() after one of these
errors occurs.  (Note, these errors *shouldn't* happen; we're just
talking about what happens if they do anyway.)

Fix this by making blk_crypto_evict_key() unlink the key from the

When this sequence gets applied via btrfs_tree_mod_log_rewind, it
allocates a fresh rewind eb, and first inserts the correct key info for
the 533 elements, then overwrites the first 456 of them, then decrements
the count by 456 via the add ops, then rewinds the move by doing a
memmove from 456:988->0:532. We have never written anything past 532,

To recover, the state of the wqe is restored to the state before
the packet was sent so it can be resent. However, the routines

netfilter: ipset: Rework long task execution when adding/deleting entries

When adding/deleting large number of elements in one step in ipset, it can
take a reasonable amount of time and can result in soft lockup errors. The
patch 5f7b51bf09ba (""netfilter: ipset: Limit the maximal range of
consecutive elements to add/delete"") tried to fix it by limiting the max
elements to process at all. However it was not enough, it is still possible
that we get hung tasks. Lowering the limit is not reasonable, so the
approach in this patch is as follows: rely on the method used at resizing
sets and save the state when we reach a smaller internal batch limit,
unlock/lock and proceed from the saved state. Thus we can avoid long
continuous tasks and at the same time removed the limit to add/delete large
number of elements in one step.

The nfnl mutex is held during the whole operation which prevents one to
issue other ipset commands in parallel."

tracing/histograms: Add histograms to hist_vars if they have referenced variables

Hist triggers can have referenced variables without having direct
variables fields. This can be the case if referenced variables are added
for trigger actions. In this case the newly added references will not
have field variables. Not taking such referenced variables into
consideration can result in a bug where it would be possible to remove
hist trigger with variables being refenced. This will result in a bug
that is easily reproducable like so

$ cd /sys/kernel/tracing

Analysis

This bug has the same root cause of 'commit 7f27ec978b0e (""ocfs2: call
ocfs2_journal_access_di() before ocfs2_journal_dirty() in
ocfs2_write_end_nolock()"")'.  For this bug, jbd2_journal_restart() is
called by ocfs2_split_extent() during defragmenting.

How to fix

For ocfs2_split_extent() can handle journal operations totally by itself. 
Caller doesn't need to call journal access/dirty pair, and caller only
needs to call journal start/stop pair.  The fix method is to remove
journal access/dirty from __ocfs2_move_extent().

wifi: brcmfmac: Check for probe() id argument being NULL

The probe() id argument may be NULL in 2 scenarios:

1. brcmf_pcie_pm_leave_D3() calling brcmf_pcie_probe() to reprobe
   the device.

2. If a user tries to manually bind the driver from sysfs then the sdio /
   pcie / usb probe() function gets called with NULL as id argument.

1. Is being hit by users causing the following oops on resume and causing

kthread_stop() in cpu_map_kthread_stop(), and kthread() doesn't call
cpu_map_kthread_run() at all but XDP program has already queued some
frames or skbs into ptr_ring. So when __cpu_map_ring_cleanup() checks
the ptr_ring, it will find it was not emptied and report a warning.

An alternative fix is to use __cpu_map_ring_cleanup() to drop these
pending frames or skbs when kthread_stop() returns -EINTR, but it may
confuse the user, because these frames or skbs have been handled
correctly by XDP program. So instead of dropping these frames or skbs,
just make sure the per-cpu kthread is running before

After apply the fix, the error handle for kthread_stop() will be
unnecessary because it will always return 0, so just remove it."

USB: Gadget: core: Help prevent panic during UVC unconfigure

Avichal Rakesh reported a kernel panic that occurred when the UVC
gadget driver was removed from a gadget's configuration.  The panic
involves a somewhat complicated interaction between the kernel driver
and a userspace component (as described in the Link tag below), but
the analysis did make one thing clear: The Gadget core should
accomodate gadget drivers calling usb_gadget_deactivate() as part of
their unbind procedure.

Currently this doesn't work.  gadget_unbind_driver() calls
driver->unbind() while holding the udc->connect_lock mutex, and
usb_gadget_deactivate() attempts to acquire that mutex, which will
result in a deadlock.

The simple fix is for gadget_unbind_driver() to release the mutex when
invoking the ->unbind() callback.  There is no particular reason for
it to be holding the mutex at that time, and the mutex isn't held
while the ->bind() callback is invoked.  So we'll drop the mutex
before performing the unbind callback and reacquire it afterward.

We'll also add a couple of comments to usb_gadget_activate() and
usb_gadget_deactivate().  Because they run in process context they
must not be called from a gadget driver's ->disconnect() callback,
which (according to the kerneldoc for struct usb_gadget_driver in
include/linux/usb/gadget.h) may run in interrupt context.  This may
help prevent similar bugs from arising in the future."

CVE-2023-53583	2025-10-04T16:15:54.090	2025-10-06T14:56:21.733	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf: RISC-V: Remove PERF_HES_STOPPED flag checking in riscv_pmu_start()

Since commit 096b52fd2bb4 (""perf: RISC-V: throttle perf events"") the
perf_sample_event_took() function was added to report time spent in
overflow interrupts. If the interrupt takes too long, the perf framework
will lower the sysctl_perf_event_sample_rate and max_samples_per_tick.
When hwc->interrupts is larger than max_samples_per_tick, the
hwc->interrupts will be set to MAX_INTERRUPTS, and events will be
throttled within the __perf_event_account_interrupt() function.

However, the RISC-V PMU driver doesn't call riscv_pmu_stop() to update the
PERF_HES_STOPPED flag after perf_event_overflow() in pmu_sbi_ovf_handler()
function to avoid throttling. When the perf framework unthrottled the event
in the timer interrupt handler, it triggers riscv_pmu_start() function
and causes a WARN_ON_ONCE() warning, as shown below:

they don't call *_pmu_stop() to update with PERF_HES_STOPPED flag

flag checking in *_pmu_start() which don't cause this warning.

CVE-2023-53584	2025-10-04T16:15:54.217	2025-10-06T14:56:21.733	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ubifs: ubifs_releasepage: Remove ubifs_assert(0) to valid this process

There are two states for ubifs writing pages:

2. Not Dirty, Not Private

The normal process cannot go to ubifs_releasepage() which means there
exists pages being private but not dirty. Reproducer[1] shows that it
could occur (which maybe related to [2]) with following process:

     PA                     PB                    PC
lock(page)[PA]
ubifs_write_end

unlock(page)

write_cache_pages[PA]
  lock(page)
  clear_page_dirty_for_io(page)	// clear Dirty
  ubifs_writepage

			  truncate_setsize
			    i_size_write(inode, newsize) // newsize = 0

    i_size = i_size_read(inode)	// i_size = 0
    end_index = i_size >> PAGE_SHIFT
    if (page->index > end_index)
      goto out // jump
out:
unlock(page)   // Private, Not Dirty

						generic_fadvise[PC]
						  lock(page)
						  invalidate_inode_page

CVE-2023-53585	2025-10-04T16:15:54.703	2025-10-06T14:56:21.733	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: reject unhashed sockets in bpf_sk_assign

The semantics for bpf_sk_assign are as follows:

    sk = some_lookup_func()
    bpf_sk_assign(skb, sk)
    bpf_sk_release(sk)

That is, the sk is not consumed by bpf_sk_assign. The function
therefore needs to make sure that sk lives long enough to be
consumed from __inet_lookup_skb. The path through the stack for a
TCPv4 packet is roughly:

  netif_receive_skb_core: takes RCU read lock
    __netif_receive_skb_core:
      sch_handle_ingress:
        tcf_classify:
          bpf_sk_assign()
      deliver_ptype_list_skb:
        deliver_skb:
          ip_packet_type->func == ip_rcv:
            ip_rcv_core:
            ip_rcv_finish_core:
              dst_input:
                ip_local_deliver:
                  ip_local_deliver_finish:
                    ip_protocol_deliver_rcu:
                      tcp_v4_rcv:
                        __inet_lookup_skb:
                          skb_steal_sock

The existing helper takes advantage of the fact that everything
happens in the same RCU critical section: for sockets with
SOCK_RCU_FREE set bpf_sk_assign never takes a reference.
skb_steal_sock then checks SOCK_RCU_FREE again and does sock_put
if necessary.

This approach assumes that SOCK_RCU_FREE is never set on a sk
between bpf_sk_assign and skb_steal_sock, but this invariant is
violated by unhashed UDP sockets. A new UDP socket is created
in TCP_CLOSE state but without SOCK_RCU_FREE set. That flag is only
added in udp_lib_get_port() which happens when a socket is bound.

When bpf_sk_assign was added it wasn't possible to access unhashed
UDP sockets from BPF, so this wasn't a problem. This changed
in commit 0c48eefae712 (""sock_map: Lift socket state restriction
for datagram sockets""), but the helper wasn't adjusted accordingly.
The following sequence of events will therefore lead to a refcount
leak:

1. Add socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM) to a sockmap.
2. Pull socket out of sockmap and bpf_sk_assign it. Since
   SOCK_RCU_FREE is not set we increment the refcount.
3. bind() or connect() the socket, setting SOCK_RCU_FREE.
4. skb_steal_sock will now set refcounted = false due to
   SOCK_RCU_FREE.
5. tcp_v4_rcv() skips sock_put().

Fix the problem by rejecting unhashed sockets in bpf_sk_assign().
This matches the behaviour of __inet_lookup_skb which is ultimately
the goal of bpf_sk_assign()."					
CVE-2023-53586	2025-10-04T16:15:54.837	2025-10-06T14:56:21.733	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: target: Fix multiple LUN_RESET handling

This fixes a bug where an initiator thinks a LUN_RESET has cleaned up
running commands when it hasn't. The bug was added in commit 51ec502a3266
(""target: Delete tmr from list before processing"").

The problem occurs when:

 1. We have N I/O cmds running in the target layer spread over 2 sessions.

 2. The initiator sends a LUN_RESET for each session.

 3. session1's LUN_RESET loops over all the running commands from both
    sessions and moves them to its local drain_task_list.

 4. session2's LUN_RESET does not see the LUN_RESET from session1 because
    the commit above has it remove itself. session2 also does not see any
    commands since the other reset moved them off the state lists.

 5. sessions2's LUN_RESET will then complete with a successful response.

 6. sessions2's inititor believes the running commands on its session are
    now cleaned up due to the successful response and cleans up the running
    commands from its side. It then restarts them.

 7. The commands do eventually complete on the backend and the target
    starts to return aborted task statuses for them. The initiator will
    either throw a invalid ITT error or might accidentally lookup a new
    task if the ITT has been reallocated already.

Fix the bug by reverting the patch, and serialize the execution of
LUN_RESETs and Preempt and Aborts.

Also prevent us from waiting on LUN_RESETs in core_tmr_drain_tmr_list,
because it turns out the original patch fixed a bug that was not
mentioned. For LUN_RESET1 core_tmr_drain_tmr_list can see a second
LUN_RESET and wait on it. Then the second reset will run
core_tmr_drain_tmr_list and see the first reset and wait on it resulting in
a deadlock."

net/mlx5e: Fix deadlock in tc route query code

Cited commit causes ABBA deadlock[0] when peer flows are created while
holding the devcom rw semaphore. Due to peer flows offload implementation
the lock is taken much higher up the call chain and there is no obvious way
to easily fix the deadlock. Instead, since tc route query code needs the
peer eswitch structure only to perform a lookup in xarray and doesn't
perform any sleeping operations with it, refactor the code for lockless
execution in following ways:

- RCUify the devcom 'data' pointer. When resetting the pointer
synchronously wait for RCU grace period before returning. This is fine
since devcom is currently only used for synchronization of
pairing/unpairing of eswitches which is rare and already expensive as-is.

- Wrap all usages of 'paired' boolean in {READ|WRITE}_ONCE(). The flag has
already been used in some unlocked contexts without proper
annotations (e.g. users of mlx5_devcom_is_paired() function), but it wasn't
an issue since all relevant code paths checked it again after obtaining the
devcom semaphore. Now it is also used by mlx5_devcom_get_peer_data_rcu() as
""best effort"" check to return NULL when devcom is being unpaired. Note that
while RCU read lock doesn't prevent the unpaired flag from being changed
concurrently it still guarantees that reader can continue to use 'data'.

- Refactor mlx5e_tc_query_route_vport() function to use new
mlx5_devcom_get_peer_data_rcu() API which fixes the deadlock.

Without this change, when fscache is in use and cache hit occurs during

__cifs_readpage_from_fscache on success. Releasing the lock at that

CVE-2023-53596	2025-10-04T16:15:56.153	2025-10-06T14:56:21.733	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drivers: base: Free devm resources when unregistering a device

In the current code, devres_release_all() only gets called if the device
has a bus and has been probed.

This leads to issues when using bus-less or driver-less devices where
the device might never get freed if a managed resource holds a reference
to the device. This is happening in the DRM framework for example.

We should thus call devres_release_all() in the device_del() function to
make sure that the device-managed actions are properly executed when the
device is unregistered, even if it has neither a bus nor a driver.

This is effectively the same change than commit 2f8d16a996da (""devres:
release resources on device_del()"") that got reverted by commit
a525a3ddeaca (""driver core: free devres in device_release"") over
memory leaks concerns.

This patch effectively combines the two commits mentioned above to
release the resources both on device_del() and device_release() and get
the best of both worlds."

cifs: fix mid leak during reconnection after timeout threshold

When the number of responses with status of STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT
exceeds a specified threshold (NUM_STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT), we reconnect
the connection. But we do not return the mid, or the credits
returned for the mid, or reduce the number of in-flight requests.

This bug could result in the server->in_flight count to go bad,
and also cause a leak in the mids.

This change moves the check to a few lines below where the
response is decrypted, even of the response is read from the
transform header. This way, the code for returning the mids
can be reused.

Also, the cifs_reconnect was reconnecting just the transport
connection before. In case of multi-channel, this may not be
what we want to do after several timeouts. Changed that to
reconnect the session and the tree too.

Also renamed NUM_STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT to a more appropriate name
MAX_STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT."

Fix af_alg_alloc_areq() to initialise areq->first_rsgl.sgl.sgt.sgl to point
to the scatterlist array in areq->first_rsgl.sgl.sgl.

Without this, the gcm-aes-s390 driver will oops when it tries to do
gcm_walk_start() on req->dst because req->dst is set to the value of
areq->first_rsgl.sgl.sgl by _aead_recvmsg() calling
aead_request_set_crypt().

The problem comes if an empty ciphertext is passed: the loop in
af_alg_get_rsgl() just passes straight out and doesn't set areq->first_rsgl
up.

This isn't a problem on x86_64 using gcmaes_crypt_by_sg() because, as far
as I can tell, that ignores req->dst and only uses req->src[*].

nfsd: clean up potential nfsd_file refcount leaks in COPY codepath

There are two different flavors of the nfsd4_copy struct. One is
embedded in the compound and is used directly in synchronous copies. The
other is dynamically allocated, refcounted and tracked in the client
struture. For the embedded one, the cleanup just involves releasing any
nfsd_files held on its behalf. For the async one, the cleanup is a bit
more involved, and we need to dequeue it from lists, unhash it, etc.

There is at least one potential refcount leak in this code now. If the
kthread_create call fails, then both the src and dst nfsd_files in the
original nfsd4_copy object are leaked.

The cleanup in this codepath is also sort of weird. In the async copy
case, we'll have up to four nfsd_file references (src and dst for both
flavors of copy structure). They are both put at the end of
nfsd4_do_async_copy, even though the ones held on behalf of the embedded
one outlive that structure.

Change it so that we always clean up the nfsd_file refs held by the
embedded copy structure before nfsd4_copy returns. Rework
cleanup_async_copy to handle both inter and intra copies. Eliminate
nfsd4_cleanup_intra_ssc since it now becomes a no-op."

nilfs2: fix potential UAF of struct nilfs_sc_info in nilfs_segctor_thread()

The finalization of nilfs_segctor_thread() can race with
nilfs_segctor_kill_thread() which terminates that thread, potentially
causing a use-after-free BUG as KASAN detected.

At the end of nilfs_segctor_thread(), it assigns NULL to ""sc_task"" member
of ""struct nilfs_sc_info"" to indicate the thread has finished, and then
notifies nilfs_segctor_kill_thread() of this using waitqueue
""sc_wait_task"" on the struct nilfs_sc_info.

However, here, immediately after the NULL assignment to ""sc_task"", it is
possible that nilfs_segctor_kill_thread() will detect it and return to
continue the deallocation, freeing the nilfs_sc_info structure before the
thread does the notification.

This fixes the issue by protecting the NULL assignment to ""sc_task"" and
its notification, with spinlock ""sc_state_lock"" of the struct
nilfs_sc_info.  Since nilfs_segctor_kill_thread() does a final check to

CVE-2023-53612	2025-10-04T16:15:57.987	2025-10-06T14:56:21.733	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hwmon: (coretemp) Simplify platform device handling

Coretemp's platform driver is unconventional. All the real work is done
globally by the initcall and CPU hotplug notifiers, while the ""driver""
effectively just wraps an allocation and the registration of the hwmon
interface in a long-winded round-trip through the driver core.  The whole
logic of dynamically creating and destroying platform devices to bring
the interfaces up and down is error prone, since it assumes
platform_device_add() will synchronously bind the driver and set drvdata
before it returns, thus results in a NULL dereference if drivers_autoprobe
is turned off for the platform bus. Furthermore, the unusual approach of
doing that from within a CPU hotplug notifier, already commented in the
code that it deadlocks suspend, also causes lockdep issues for other
drivers or subsystems which may want to legitimately register a CPU
hotplug notifier from a platform bus notifier.

All of these issues can be solved by ripping this unusual behaviour out
completely, simply tying the platform devices to the lifetime of the
module itself, and directly managing the hwmon interfaces from the
hotplug notifiers. There is a slight user-visible change in that
/sys/bus/platform/drivers/coretemp will no longer appear, and
/sys/devices/platform/coretemp.n will remain present if package n is
hotplugged off, but hwmon users should really only be looking for the
presence of the hwmon interfaces, whose behaviour remains unchanged."

If we load a DHAV file that is larger than MAX_DURATION_BUFFER_SIZE bytes (0x100000) for example 0x101000 bytes, then at [0] we have size = 0x101000. At [1] we have end_buffer_size = 0x100000, and at [2] we have end_buffer_pos = 0x1000.

The loop then scans backwards through the buffer looking for the dhav tag; when it is found, we'll calculate end_pos based on a 32-bit offset read from the buffer.

There is subsequently a check [3] that end_pos is within the section of the file that has been copied into end_buffer, but it only correctly handles the cases where end_pos is before the start of the file or after the section copied into end_buffer, and not the case where end_pos is within the the file, but before the section copied into end_buffer.

CVE-2025-59734	2025-10-06T08:15:35.227	2025-10-06T14:56:21.733	"It is possible to cause an use-after-free write in SANM decoding with a carefully crafted animation using subversion <2.

When a STOR chunk is present, a subsequent FOBJ chunk will be saved in ctx->stored_frame. Stored frames can later be referenced by FTCH chunks. For files using subversion < 2, the undecoded frame is stored, and decoded again when the FTCH chunks are parsed. However, in process_frame_obj if the frame has an invalid size, there’s an early return, with a value of 0. 

This causes the code in decode_frame to still store the raw frame buffer into ctx->stored_frame. Leaving ctx->has_dimensions set to false.

A subsequent chunk with type FTCH would call process_ftch and decode that frame obj again, adding to the top/left values and calling process_frame_obj again.
Given that we never set ctx->have_dimensions before, this time we set the dimensions, calling init_buffers, which can reallocate the buffer in ctx->stored_frame, freeing the previous one. However, the GetByteContext object gb still holds a reference to the old buffer.




Finally, when the code tries to decode the frame, codecs that accept a GetByteContext as a parameter will trigger a use-after-free read when using gb.

GetByteContext is only used for reading bytes, so at most one could read invalid data. There are no heap allocations between the free and when the object is accessed. However, upon returning to process_ftch, the code restores the original values for top/left in stored_frame, writing 4 bytes to the freed data at offset 6, potentially corrupting the allocator’s metadata.

This issue can be triggered just by probing whether a file has the sanm format.

CVE-2025-52472	2025-10-06T15:16:04.260	2025-10-08T19:38:32.610	XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Starting in version 4.3-milestone-1 and prior to versions 16.10.9, 17.4.2, and 17.5.0, the REST search URL is vulnerable to HQL injection via the `orderField` parameter. The specified value is added twice in the query, though, once in the field list for the select and once in the order clause, so it's not that easy to exploit. The part of the query between the two fields can be enclosed in single quotes to effectively remove them, but the query still needs to remain valid with the query two times in it. This has been patched in versions 17.5.0, 17.4.2, and 16.10.9. No known workarounds are available.

CVE-2025-59152	2025-10-06T16:15:34.193	2025-10-08T19:38:32.610	Litestar is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework. In version 2.17.0, rate limits can be completely bypassed by manipulating the X-Forwarded-For header. This renders IP-based rate limiting ineffective against determined attackers. Litestar's RateLimitMiddleware uses `cache_key_from_request()` to generate cache keys for rate limiting. When an X-Forwarded-For header is present, the middleware trusts it unconditionally and uses its value as part of the client identifier. Since clients can set arbitrary X-Forwarded-For values, each different spoofed IP creates a separate rate limit bucket. An attacker can rotate through different header values to avoid hitting any single bucket's limit. This affects any Litestar application using RateLimitMiddleware with default settings, which likely includes most applications that implement rate limiting. Version 2.18.0 contains a patch for the vulnerability.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2025-59159	2025-10-06T16:15:34.377	2025-10-08T19:38:32.610	SillyTavern is a locally installed user interface that allows users to interact with text generation large language models, image generation engines, and text-to-speech voice models. In versions prior to 1.13.4, the web user interface for SillyTavern is susceptible to DNS rebinding, allowing attackers to perform actions like install malicious extensions, read chats, inject arbitrary HTML for phishing attacks, etc. The vulnerability has been patched in the version 1.13.4 by introducing a server configuration setting that enables a validation of host names in inbound HTTP requests according to the provided list of allowed hosts: `hostWhitelist.enabled` in config.yaml file or `SILLYTAVERN_HOSTWHITELIST_ENABLED` environment variable. While the setting is disabled by default to honor a wide variety of existing user configurations and maintain backwards compatibility, existing and new users are encouraged to review their server configurations and apply necessary changes to their setup, especially if hosting over the local network while not using SSL.	9.6	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2025-61687	2025-10-06T16:15:35.223	2025-10-08T19:38:32.610	Flowise is a drag & drop user interface to build a customized large language model flow. A file upload vulnerability in version 3.0.7 of FlowiseAI allows authenticated users to upload arbitrary files without proper validation. This enables attackers to persistently store malicious Node.js web shells on the server, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The system fails to validate file extensions, MIME types, or file content during uploads. As a result, malicious scripts such as Node.js-based web shells can be uploaded and stored persistently on the server. These shells expose HTTP endpoints capable of executing arbitrary commands if triggered. The uploaded shell does not automatically execute, but its presence allows future exploitation via administrator error or chained vulnerabilities. This presents a high-severity threat to system integrity and confidentiality. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.	8.3	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2025-61765	2025-10-06T16:15:35.400	2025-10-08T19:38:32.610	python-socketio is a Python implementation of the Socket.IO realtime client and server. A remote code execution vulnerability in python-socketio versions prior to 5.14.0 allows attackers to execute arbitrary Python code through malicious pickle deserialization in multi-server deployments on which the attacker previously gained access to the message queue that the servers use for internal communications. When Socket.IO servers are configured to use a message queue backend such as Redis for inter-server communication, messages sent between the servers are encoded using the `pickle` Python module. When a server receives one of these messages through the message queue, it assumes it is trusted and immediately deserializes it. The vulnerability stems from deserialization of messages using Python's `pickle.loads()` function. Having previously obtained access to the message queue, the attacker can send a python-socketio server a crafted pickle payload that executes arbitrary code during deserialization via Python's `__reduce__` method. This vulnerability only affects deployments with a compromised message queue. The attack can lead to the attacker executing random code in the context of, and with the privileges of a Socket.IO server process. Single-server systems that do not use a message queue, and multi-server systems with a secure message queue are not vulnerable. In addition to making sure standard security practices are followed in the deployment of the message queue, users of the python-socketio package can upgrade to version 5.14.0 or newer, which remove the `pickle` module and use the much safer JSON encoding for inter-server messaging.	6.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L

CVE-2025-61778	2025-10-06T17:16:08.297	2025-10-08T19:38:32.610	"Akka.NET is a .NET port of the Akka project from the Scala / Java community. In all versions of Akka.Remote from v1.2.0 to v1.5.51, TLS could be enabled via our `akka.remote.dot-netty.tcp` transport and this would correctly enforce private key validation on the server-side of inbound connections. Akka.Remote, however, never asked the outbound-connecting client to present ITS certificate - therefore it's possible for untrusted parties to connect to a private key'd Akka.NET cluster and begin communicating with it without any certificate. The issue here is that for certificate-based authentication to work properly, ensuring that all members of the Akka.Remote network are secured with the same private key, Akka.Remote needed to implement mutual TLS. This was not the case before Akka.NET v1.5.52. Those who run Akka.NET inside a private network that they fully control or who were never using TLS in the first place are now affected by the bug. However, those who use TLS to secure their networks must upgrade to Akka.NET V1.5.52 or later. One patch forces ""fail fast"" semantics if TLS is enabled but the private key is missing or invalid. Previous versions would only check that once connection attempts occurred. The second patch, a critical fix, enforces mutual TLS (mTLS) by default, so both parties must be keyed using the same certificate. As a workaround, avoid exposing the application publicly to avoid the vulnerability having a practical impact on one's application. However, upgrading to version 1.5.52 is still recommended by the maintainers."

This vulnerability arises because the class allows the use of arbitrary XSLT stylesheets, which are parsed using lxml.etree.parse() and lxml.etree.XSLT() without any hardening measures. In lxml versions up to 4.9.x, external entities are resolved by default, allowing attackers to read arbitrary local files or perform outbound HTTP(S) fetches. In lxml versions 5.0 and above, while entity expansion is disabled, the XSLT document() function can still read any URI unless XSLTAccessControl is applied. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to gain read-only access to any file the LangChain process can reach, including sensitive files such as SSH keys, environment files, source code, or cloud metadata. No authentication, special privileges, or user interaction are required, and the issue is exploitable in default deployments that enable custom XSLT.

CVE-2025-61770	2025-10-07T15:16:02.950	2025-10-10T16:44:36.910	Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. In versions prior to 2.2.19, 3.1.17, and 3.2.2, `Rack::Multipart::Parser` buffers the entire multipart preamble (bytes before the first boundary) in memory without any size limit. A client can send a large preamble followed by a valid boundary, causing significant memory use and potential process termination due to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions. Remote attackers can trigger large transient memory spikes by including a long preamble in multipart/form-data requests. The impact scales with allowed request sizes and concurrency, potentially causing worker crashes or severe slowdown due to garbage collection. Versions 2.2.19, 3.1.17, and 3.2.2 enforce a preamble size limit (e.g., 16 KiB) or discard preamble data entirely. Workarounds include limiting total request body size at the proxy or web server level and monitoring memory and set per-process limits to prevent OOM conditions.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

In versions prior to 2.2.19, 3.1.17, and 3.2.2, ``Rack::Multipart::Parser` stores non-file form fields (parts without a `filename`) entirely in memory as Ruby `String` objects. A single large text field in a multipart/form-data request (hundreds of megabytes or more) can consume equivalent process memory, potentially leading to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions and denial of service (DoS). Attackers can send large non-file fields to trigger excessive memory usage. Impact scales with request size and concurrency, potentially leading to worker crashes or severe garbage-collection overhead. All Rack applications processing multipart form submissions are affected. Versions 2.2.19, 3.1.17, and 3.2.2 enforce a reasonable size cap for non-file fields (e.g., 2 MiB). Workarounds include restricting maximum request body size at the web-server or proxy layer (e.g., Nginx `client_max_body_size`) and validating and rejecting unusually large form fields at the application level.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

In versions prior to 2.2.19, 3.1.17, and 3.2.2, `Rack::Multipart::Parser` can accumulate unbounded data when a multipart part’s header block never terminates with the required blank line (`CRLFCRLF`). The parser keeps appending incoming bytes to memory without a size cap, allowing a remote attacker to exhaust memory and cause a denial of service (DoS). Attackers can send incomplete multipart headers to trigger high memory use, leading to process termination (OOM) or severe slowdown. The effect scales with request size limits and concurrency. All applications handling multipart uploads may be affected. Versions 2.2.19, 3.1.17, and 3.2.2 cap per-part header size (e.g., 64 KiB).

This patch fixes the issue by checking also on DLM_LKF_VALBLK on exflags
is set when copying the lvbptr array instead of if it's just null which
fixes for me the issue.

I think this patch can fix other dlm users as well, depending how they
handle the init, freeing memory handling of sb_lvbptr and don't set
DLM_LKF_VALBLK for some dlm_lock() calls. It might a there could be a
hidden issue all the time. However with checking on DLM_LKF_VALBLK the
user always need to provide a sb_lvbptr non-null value. There might be
more intelligent handling between per ls lvblen, DLM_LKF_VALBLK and
non-null to report the user the way how DLM API is used is wrong but can
be added for later, this will only fix the current behaviour."

The problem can be reproduced with the mmtests config
config-workload-stressng-mmap.  It does not always happen and when it
triggers is variable but it has happened on multiple machines.

The intent of commit b653db77350c patch was to avoid the case where
PG_private is clear but folio->private is not-NULL.  However, THP tail
pages uses page->private for ""swp_entry_t if folio_test_swapcache()"" as
stated in the documentation for struct folio.  This patch only clobbers
page->private for tail pages if the head page was not in swapcache and
warns once if page->private had an unexpected value."

media: si470x: Fix use-after-free in si470x_int_in_callback()

syzbot reported use-after-free in si470x_int_in_callback() [1].  This
indicates that urb->context, which contains struct si470x_device
object, is freed when si470x_int_in_callback() is called.

The cause of this issue is that si470x_int_in_callback() is called for
freed urb.

si470x_usb_driver_probe() calls si470x_start_usb(), which then calls
usb_submit_urb() and si470x_start().  If si470x_start_usb() fails,
si470x_usb_driver_probe() doesn't kill urb, but it just frees struct
si470x_device object, as depicted below:

si470x_usb_driver_probe()
  ...
  si470x_start_usb()
    ...
    usb_submit_urb()
    retval = si470x_start()
    return retval
  if (retval < 0)
    free struct si470x_device object, but don't kill urb

This patch fixes this issue by killing urb when si470x_start_usb()
fails and urb is submitted.  If si470x_start_usb() fails and urb is
not submitted, i.e. submitting usb fails, it just frees struct
si470x_device object."

The root cause is traced to the phy_device is not disconnected when
removes one r6040 device in r6040_remove_one() or on error handling path
after r6040_mii probed successfully. In r6040_mii_probe(), a net ethernet
device is connected to the first PHY device of mii_bus, in order to
notify the connected driver when the link status changes, which is the
default behavior of the PHY infrastructure to handle everything.
Therefore the phy_device should be disconnected when removes one r6040
device or on error handling path.

Fix it by adding phy_disconnect() when removes one r6040 device or on
error handling path after r6040_mii probed successfully."

=====================================================

Now, 'ext4_alloc_inode()' didn't init 'ei->i_flags'. If new inode failed
before set 'ei->i_flags' in '__ext4_new_inode()', then do 'iput()'. As after
6bc0d63dad7f commit will access 'ei->i_flags' in 'ext4_evict_inode()' which
will lead to access uninit-value.
To solve above issue just init 'ei->i_flags' in 'ext4_alloc_inode()'."

CVE-2022-50550	2025-10-07T16:15:40.790	2025-10-08T19:38:32.610	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-iolatency: Fix memory leak on add_disk() failures

When a gendisk is successfully initialized but add_disk() fails such as when
a loop device has invalid number of minor device numbers specified,
blkcg_init_disk() is called during init and then blkcg_exit_disk() during
error handling. Unfortunately, iolatency gets initialized in the former but
doesn't get cleaned up in the latter.

This is because, in non-error cases, the cleanup is performed by
del_gendisk() calling rq_qos_exit(), the assumption being that rq_qos
policies, iolatency being one of them, can only be activated once the disk
is fully registered and visible. That assumption is true for wbt and iocost,
but not so for iolatency as it gets initialized before add_disk() is called.

It is desirable to lazy-init rq_qos policies because they are optional
features and add to hot path overhead once initialized - each IO has to walk
all the registered rq_qos policies. So, we want to switch iolatency to lazy
init too. However, that's a bigger change. As a fix for the immediate
problem, let's just add an extra call to rq_qos_exit() in blkcg_exit_disk().
This is safe because duplicate calls to rq_qos_exit() become noop's."

wifi: brcmfmac: Fix potential shift-out-of-bounds in brcmf_fw_alloc_request()

This patch fixes a shift-out-of-bounds in brcmfmac that occurs in
BIT(chiprev) when a 'chiprev' provided by the device is too large.
It should also not be equal to or greater than BITS_PER_TYPE(u32)
as we do bitwise AND with a u32 variable and BIT(chiprev). The patch
adds a check that makes the function return NULL if that is the case.
Note that the NULL case is later handled by the bus-specific caller,
brcmf_usb_probe_cb() or brcmf_usb_reset_resume(), for example.

Found by a modified version of syzkaller.

stop the hctx work from running. The work may get an elevator pointer

tracing/hist: Fix out-of-bound write on 'action_data.var_ref_idx'

When generate a synthetic event with many params and then create a trace
action for it [1], kernel panic happened [2].

It is because that in trace_action_create() 'data->n_params' is up to
SYNTH_FIELDS_MAX (current value is 64), and array 'data->var_ref_idx'
keeps indices into array 'hist_data->var_refs' for each synthetic event
param, but the length of 'data->var_ref_idx' is TRACING_MAP_VARS_MAX
(current value is 16), so out-of-bound write happened when 'data->n_params'
more than 16. In this case, 'data->match_data.event' is overwritten and
eventually cause the panic.

To solve the issue, adjust the length of 'data->var_ref_idx' to be
SYNTH_FIELDS_MAX and add sanity checks to avoid out-of-bound write.

CVE-2022-50554	2025-10-07T16:15:43.423	2025-10-08T19:38:32.610	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-mq: avoid double ->queue_rq() because of early timeout

David Jeffery found one double ->queue_rq() issue, so far it can
be triggered in VM use case because of long vmexit latency or preempt
latency of vCPU pthread or long page fault in vCPU pthread, then block
IO req could be timed out before queuing the request to hardware but after
calling blk_mq_start_request() during ->queue_rq(), then timeout handler
may handle it by requeue, then double ->queue_rq() is caused, and kernel
panic.

So far, it is driver's responsibility to cover the race between timeout
and completion, so it seems supposed to be solved in driver in theory,
given driver has enough knowledge.

But it is really one common problem, lots of driver could have similar
issue, and could be hard to fix all affected drivers, even it isn't easy
for driver to handle the race. So David suggests this patch by draining
in-progress ->queue_rq() for solving this issue."

srv->listener is protected by srv->idr_lock in tipc_topsrv_stop(), so add
a check for srv->listener under srv->idr_lock in tipc_topsrv_accept() to
avoid the null-ptr-deref. To ensure the lsock is not released during the
tipc_topsrv_accept(), move sock_release() after tipc_topsrv_work_stop()
where it's waiting until the tipc_topsrv_accept worker to be done.

Note that sk_callback_lock is used to protect sk->sk_user_data instead of
srv->listener, and it should check srv in tipc_topsrv_listener_data_ready()

btrfs: reject invalid reloc tree root keys with stack dump

[BUG]
Syzbot reported a crash that an ASSERT() got triggered inside
prepare_to_merge().

That ASSERT() makes sure the reloc tree is properly pointed back by its
subvolume tree.

[CAUSE]
After more debugging output, it turns out we had an invalid reloc tree:

  BTRFS error (device loop1): reloc tree mismatch, root 8 has no reloc root, expect reloc root key (-8, 132, 8) gen 17

Note the above root key is (TREE_RELOC_OBJECTID, ROOT_ITEM,
QUOTA_TREE_OBJECTID), meaning it's a reloc tree for quota tree.

But reloc trees can only exist for subvolumes, as for non-subvolume
trees, we just COW the involved tree block, no need to create a reloc
tree since those tree blocks won't be shared with other trees.

Only subvolumes tree can share tree blocks with other trees (thus they
have BTRFS_ROOT_SHAREABLE flag).

Thus this new debug output proves my previous assumption that corrupted
on-disk data can trigger that ASSERT().

[FIX]
Besides the dedicated fix and the graceful exit, also let tree-checker to
check such root keys, to make sure reloc trees can only exist for subvolumes."

netfilter: conntrack: Avoid nf_ct_helper_hash uses after free

If nf_conntrack_init_start() fails (for example due to a

clean-up path frees the nf_ct_helper_hash map.

When built with NF_CONNTRACK=y, further netfilter modules (e.g:
netfilter_conntrack_ftp) can still be loaded and call
nf_conntrack_helpers_register(), independently of whether nf_conntrack
initialized correctly. This accesses the nf_ct_helper_hash dangling

mm/swap: fix swap_info_struct race between swapoff and get_swap_pages()

The si->lock must be held when deleting the si from the available list. 
Otherwise, another thread can re-add the si to the available list, which
can lead to memory corruption.  The only place we have found where this
happens is in the swapoff path.  This case can be described as below:

core 0                       core 1
swapoff

del_from_avail_list(si)      waiting

try lock si->lock            acquire swap_avail_lock

acquire si->lock but missing si already being added again, and continuing
to clear SWP_WRITEOK, etc.

It can be easily found that a massive warning messages can be triggered
inside get_swap_pages() by some special cases, for example, we call
madvise(MADV_PAGEOUT) on blocks of touched memory concurrently, meanwhile,
run much swapon-swapoff operations (e.g.  stress-ng-swap).

However, in the worst case, panic can be caused by the above scene.  In
swapoff(), the memory used by si could be kept in swap_info[] after
turning off a swap.  This means memory corruption will not be caused
immediately until allocated and reset for a new swap in the swapon path. 
A panic message caused: (with CONFIG_PLIST_DEBUG enabled)

CPU soft-lockup warning even with few sockets. It's not an infinite loop,
but ""credit"" wasn't probably meant to be minus 2Gb for each new flow.
Capping ""initial quantum"" to INT_MAX proved to fix the issue.

v2: validation of ""initial quantum"" is done in fq_policy, instead of open
    coding in fq_change() _ suggested by Jakub Kicinski"

iommufd: Fix unpinning of pages when an access is present

syzkaller found that the calculation of batch_last_index should use
'start_index' since at input to this function the batch is either empty or
it has already been adjusted to cross any accesses so it will start at the
point we are unmapping from.

Getting this wrong causes the unmap to run over the end of the pages
which corrupts pages that were never mapped. In most cases this triggers
the num pinned debugging:

netfilter: conntrack: fix wrong ct->timeout value

(struct nf_conn)->timeout is an interval before the conntrack
confirmed.  After confirmed, it becomes a timestamp.

It is observed that timeout of an unconfirmed conntrack:
- Set by calling ctnetlink_change_timeout(). As a result,
  `nfct_time_stamp` was wrongly added to `ct->timeout` twice.
- Get by calling ctnetlink_dump_timeout(). As a result,
  `nfct_time_stamp` was wrongly subtracted.

Update ctnetlink to set up the timeout _after_ the IPS_CONFIRMED flag is

wifi: ath9k: hif_usb: fix memory leak of remain_skbs

hif_dev->remain_skb is allocated and used exclusively in
ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream(). It is implied that an allocated remain_skb is
processed and subsequently freed (in error paths) only during the next
call of ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream().

So, if the urbs are deallocated between those two calls due to the device
deinitialization or suspend, it is possible that ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream()
is not called next time and the allocated remain_skb is leaked. Our local
Syzkaller instance was able to trigger that.

remain_skb makes sense when receiving two consecutive urbs which are
logically linked together, i.e. a specific data field from the first skb
indicates a cached skb to be allocated, memcpy'd with some data and
subsequently processed in the next call to ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream(). Urbs
deallocation supposedly makes that link irrelevant so we need to free the
cached skb in those cases.

Fix the leak by introducing a function to explicitly free remain_skb (if
it is not NULL) when the rx urbs have been deallocated. remain_skb is NULL
when it has not been allocated at all (hif_dev struct is kzalloced) or
when it has been processed in next call to ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream().

x86: fix clear_user_rep_good() exception handling annotation

This code no longer exists in mainline, because it was removed in
commit d2c95f9d6802 (""x86: don't use REP_GOOD or ERMS for user memory
clearing"") upstream.

However, rather than backport the full range of x86 memory clearing and
copying cleanups, fix the exception table annotation placement for the
final 'rep movsb' in clear_user_rep_good(): rather than pointing at the
actual instruction that did the user space access, it pointed to the
register move just before it.

That made sense from a code flow standpoint, but not from an actual
usage standpoint: it means that if user access takes an exception, the
exception handler won't actually find the instruction in the exception
tables.

As a result, rather than fixing it up and returning -EFAULT, it would
then turn it into a kernel oops report instead, something like:

CVE-2023-53645	2025-10-07T16:15:47.893	2025-10-08T19:38:09.863	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Make bpf_refcount_acquire fallible for non-owning refs

This patch fixes an incorrect assumption made in the original
bpf_refcount series [0], specifically that the BPF program calling
bpf_refcount_acquire on some node can always guarantee that the node is
alive. In that series, the patch adding failure behavior to rbtree_add
and list_push_{front, back} breaks this assumption for non-owning
references.

Consider the following program:

  n = bpf_kptr_xchg(&mapval, NULL);
  /* skip error checking */

  bpf_spin_lock(&l);
  if(bpf_rbtree_add(&t, &n->rb, less)) {
    bpf_refcount_acquire(n);
    /* Failed to add, do something else with the node */
  }
  bpf_spin_unlock(&l);

It's incorrect to assume that bpf_refcount_acquire will always succeed in this
scenario. bpf_refcount_acquire is being called in a critical section
here, but the lock being held is associated with rbtree t, which isn't
necessarily the lock associated with the tree that the node is already
in. So after bpf_rbtree_add fails to add the node and calls bpf_obj_drop
in it, the program has no ownership of the node's lifetime. Therefore
the node's refcount can be decr'd to 0 at any time after the failing
rbtree_add. If this happens before the refcount_acquire above, the node
might be free'd, and regardless refcount_acquire will be incrementing a
0 refcount.

Later patches in the series exercise this scenario, resulting in the
expected complaint from the kernel (without this patch's changes):

The patch addresses this by changing bpf_refcount_acquire_impl to use
refcount_inc_not_zero instead of refcount_inc and marking
bpf_refcount_acquire KF_RET_NULL.

For owning references, though, we know the above scenario is not possible
and thus that bpf_refcount_acquire will always succeed. Some verifier
bookkeeping is added to track ""is input owning ref?"" for bpf_refcount_acquire
calls and return false from is_kfunc_ret_null for bpf_refcount_acquire on
owning refs despite it being marked KF_RET_NULL.

Existing selftests using bpf_refcount_acquire are modified where
necessary to NULL-check its return value.

This object has all-ones handle, which causes a NULL pointer dereference
in the ACPI code (from dereferencing this pointer with an offset).

This in turn causes an oops on boot with VMBus host implementations that do
not provide Hyper-V MMIO ranges in their VMBus ACPI device or its
ancestors.
The QEMU VMBus implementation is an example of such implementation.

I guess providing these ranges is optional, since all tested Windows
versions seem to be able to use VMBus devices without them.

Fix this by explicitly terminating the lookup at the ACPI namespace root
object.

Note that Linux guests under KVM/QEMU do not use the Hyper-V PV interface
by default - they only do so if the KVM PV interface is missing or
disabled.

rcu: Avoid stack overflow due to __rcu_irq_enter_check_tick() being kprobe-ed

Registering a kprobe on __rcu_irq_enter_check_tick() can cause kernel

CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL and booting the kernel with argument ""nohz_full="",
and then giving the following commands at the shell prompt:

  # cd /sys/kernel/tracing/
  # echo 'p:mp1 __rcu_irq_enter_check_tick' >> kprobe_events

cpu_map_kthread_run() is stopped prematurely. Another one is
__cpu_map_ring_cleanup() doesn't handle skb mode and treats skbs in
ptr_ring as XDP frames.

Prematurely-stopped kthread will be fixed by the preceding patch and
ptr_ring will be empty when __cpu_map_ring_cleanup() is called. But

net: cdc_ncm: Deal with too low values of dwNtbOutMaxSize

Currently in cdc_ncm_check_tx_max(), if dwNtbOutMaxSize is lower than
the calculated ""min"" value, but greater than zero, the logic sets
tx_max to dwNtbOutMaxSize. This is then used to allocate a new SKB in
cdc_ncm_fill_tx_frame() where all the data is handled.

For small values of dwNtbOutMaxSize the memory allocated during
alloc_skb(dwNtbOutMaxSize, GFP_ATOMIC) will have the same size, due to
how size is aligned at alloc time:
	size = SKB_DATA_ALIGN(size);
        size += SKB_DATA_ALIGN(sizeof(struct skb_shared_info));
Thus we hit the same bug that we tried to squash with
commit 2be6d4d16a084 (""net: cdc_ncm: Allow for dwNtbOutMaxSize to be unset or zero"")

Low values of dwNtbOutMaxSize do not cause an issue presently because at
alloc_skb() time more memory (512b) is allocated than required for the
SKB headers alone (320b), leaving some space (512b - 320b = 192b)
for CDC data (172b).

However, if more elements (for example 3 x u64 = [24b]) were added to
one of the SKB header structs, say 'struct skb_shared_info',
increasing its original size (320b [320b aligned]) to something larger
(344b [384b aligned]), then suddenly the CDC data (172b) no longer
fits in the spare SKB data area (512b - 384b = 128b).

Consequently the SKB bounds checking semantics fails and panics:

  }

By some analyzing, I found that when resetting ringbuffer, the 'entries'
of its pages are not all cleared (see rb_reset_cpu()). Then when reducing
the ringbuffer, and if some reduced pages exist dirty 'entries' data, they
will be added into 'cpu_buffer->overrun' (see rb_remove_pages()), which
cause wrong 'overrun' count and eventually cause the deadloop issue.

To fix it, we need to clear every pages in rb_reset_cpu()."

tcp: fix skb_copy_ubufs() vs BIG TCP

David Ahern reported crashes in skb_copy_ubufs() caused by TCP tx zerocopy
using hugepages, and skb length bigger than ~68 KB.

skb_copy_ubufs() assumed it could copy all payload using up to
MAX_SKB_FRAGS order-0 pages.

This assumption broke when BIG TCP was able to put up to 512 KB per skb.

We did not hit this bug at Google because we use CONFIG_MAX_SKB_FRAGS=45
and limit gso_max_size to 180000.

A solution is to use higher order pages if needed.

v2: add missing __GFP_COMP, or we leak memory."

As usual, the reproducer doesn't reliably trigger locally here, but at
least we know the WARN_ON() is triggered when an inline backref can not
be found, and it can only be triggered when @insert is true. (I.e.
inserting a new inline backref, which means the backref should already
exist)

CVE-2023-53679	2025-10-07T16:15:52.037	2025-10-08T19:38:09.863	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mt7601u: fix an integer underflow

Fix an integer underflow that leads to a null pointer dereference in
'mt7601u_rx_skb_from_seg()'. The variable 'dma_len' in the URB packet
could be manipulated, which could trigger an integer underflow of
'seg_len' in 'mt7601u_rx_process_seg()'. This underflow subsequently
causes the 'bad_frame' checks in 'mt7601u_rx_skb_from_seg()' to be
bypassed, eventually leading to a dereference of the pointer 'p', which
is a null pointer.

Ensure that 'dma_len' is greater than 'min_seg_len'.

Found by a modified version of syzkaller.

NFSD: Avoid calling OPDESC() with ops->opnum == OP_ILLEGAL

OPDESC() simply indexes into nfsd4_ops[] by the op's operation
number, without range checking that value. It assumes callers are
careful to avoid calling it with an out-of-bounds opnum value.

nfsd4_decode_compound() is not so careful, and can invoke OPDESC()
with opnum set to OP_ILLEGAL, which is 10044 -- well beyond the end
of nfsd4_ops[]."

CVE-2023-53685	2025-10-07T16:15:52.777	2025-10-08T19:38:09.863	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tun: Fix memory leak for detached NAPI queue.

syzkaller reported [0] memory leaks of sk and skb related to the TUN
device with no repro, but we can reproduce it easily with:

  struct ifreq ifr = {}
  int fd_tun, fd_tmp;
  char buf[4] = {};

  fd_tun = openat(AT_FDCWD, ""/dev/net/tun"", O_WRONLY, 0);
  ifr.ifr_flags = IFF_TUN | IFF_NAPI | IFF_MULTI_QUEUE;
  ioctl(fd_tun, TUNSETIFF, &ifr);

  ifr.ifr_flags = IFF_DETACH_QUEUE;
  ioctl(fd_tun, TUNSETQUEUE, &ifr);

  fd_tmp = socket(AF_PACKET, SOCK_PACKET, 0);
  ifr.ifr_flags = IFF_UP;
  ioctl(fd_tmp, SIOCSIFFLAGS, &ifr);

  write(fd_tun, buf, sizeof(buf));
  close(fd_tun);

If we enable NAPI and multi-queue on a TUN device, we can put skb into
tfile->sk.sk_write_queue after the queue is detached.  We should prevent
it by checking tfile->detached before queuing skb.

Note this must be done under tfile->sk.sk_write_queue.lock because write()
and ioctl(IFF_DETACH_QUEUE) can run concurrently.  Otherwise, there would
be a small race window:

  write()                             ioctl(IFF_DETACH_QUEUE)
  `- tun_get_user                     `- __tun_detach
     |- if (tfile->detached)             |- tun_disable_queue
     |  `-> false                        |  `- tfile->detached = tun
     |                                   `- tun_queue_purge
     |- spin_lock_bh(&queue->lock)
     `- __skb_queue_tail(queue, skb)

Another solution is to call tun_queue_purge() when closing and
reattaching the detached queue, but it could paper over another
problems.  Also, we do the same kind of test for IFF_NAPI_FRAGS.

CVE-2025-61670	2025-10-07T19:15:38.780	2025-10-08T19:38:09.863	"Wasmtime is a runtime for WebAssembly. Wasmtime 37.0.0 and 37.0.1 have memory leaks in the C/C++ API when using bindings for the `anyref` or `externref` WebAssembly values. This is caused by a regression introduced during the development of 37.0.0 and all prior versions of Wasmtime are unaffected. If `anyref` or `externref` is not used in the C/C++ API then embeddings are also unaffected by the leaky behavior. The `wasmtime` Rust crate is unaffected by this leak.

Development of Wasmtime 37.0.0 included a refactoring in Rust of changing the old `ManuallyRooted<T>` type to a new `OwnedRooted<T>` type. This change was integrated into Wasmtime's C API but left the C API in a state which had memory leaks. Additionally the new ownership semantics around this type were not reflected into the C++ API, making it leak-prone. A short version of the change is that previously `ManuallyRooted<T>`, as the name implies, required manual calls to an ""unroot"" operation. If this was forgotten then the memory was still cleaned up when the `wasmtime_store_t` itself was destroyed eventually. Documentation of when to ""unroot"" was sparse and there were already situations prior to 37.0.0 where memory would be leaked until the store was destroyed anyway. All memory, though, was always bound by the store, and destroying the store would guarantee that there were no memory leaks.

In migrating to `OwnedRooted<T>` the usage of the type in Rust changed. A manual ""unroot"" operation is no longer required and it happens naturally as a destructor of the `OwnedRooted<T>` type in Rust itself. These new resource ownership semantics were not fully integrated into the preexisting semantics of the C/C++ APIs in Wasmtime. A crucial distinction of `OwnedRooted<T>` vs `ManuallyRooted<T>` is that the `OwnedRooted<T>` type allocates host memory outside of the store. This means that if an `OwnedRooted<T>` is leaked then destroying a store does not release this memory and it's a permanent memory leak on the host.

This led to a few distinct, but related, issues arising: A typo in the `wasmtime_val_unroot` function in the C API meant that it did not actually unroot anything. This meant that even if embedders faithfully call the function then memory will be leaked. If a host-defined function returned a `wasmtime_{externref,anyref}_t` value then the value was never unrooted. The C/C++ API no longer has access to the value and the Rust implementation did not unroot. This meant that any values returned this way were never unrooted. The goal of the C++ API of Wasmtime is to encode automatic memory management in the type system, but the C++ API was not updated when `OwnedRooted<T>` was added. This meant that idiomatic usage of the C++ API would leak memory due to a lack of destructors on values.

These issues have all been fixed in a 37.0.2 release of Wasmtime. The implementation of the C and C++ APIs have been updated accordingly and respectively to account for the changes of ownership here. For example `wasmtime_val_unroot` has been fixed to unroot, the Rust-side implementation of calling an embedder-defined function will unroot return values, and the C++ API now has destructors on the `ExternRef`, `AnyRef`, and `Val` types. These changes have been made to the 37.0.x release branch in a non-API-breaking fashion. Changes to the 38.0.0 release branch (and `main` in the Wasmtime repository) include minor API updates to better accommodate the API semantic changes. The only known workaround at this time is to avoid using `externref` and `anyref` in the C/C++ API of Wasmtime. If avoiding those types is not possible then it's required for users to update to mitigate the leak issue."					
CVE-2025-61776	2025-10-07T19:15:38.963	2025-10-08T19:38:09.863	Dependency-Track is a component analysis platform that allows organizations to identify and reduce risk in the software supply chain. Prior to version 4.13.5, Dependency-Track may send credentials meant for a private NuGet repository to `api.nuget.org` via the HTTP `Authorization` header, and may disclose names and versions of components marked as internal to `api.nuget.org`. This can happen if the Dependency-Track instance contains .NET components, a custom NuGet repository has been configured, the custom repository has been configured with authentication credentials, and the repository server does not provide `PackageBaseAddress` resource in its service index. The issue has been fixed in Dependency-Track 4.13.5. Some workarounds are avaialble. Disable custom NuGet repositories until the patch has been applied, invalidate the previously used credentials, and generate new credentials for usage after the patch has been applied.	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2025-61784	2025-10-07T19:15:39.133	2025-10-08T19:38:09.863	LLaMA-Factory is a tuning library for large language models. Prior to version 0.9.4, a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the chat API allows any authenticated user to force the server to make arbitrary HTTP requests to internal and external networks. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive internal services, reconnaissance of the internal network, or interaction with third-party services. The same mechanism also allows for a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, enabling users to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. The vulnerability exists in the `_process_request` function within `src/llamafactory/api/chat.py.` This function is responsible for processing incoming multimodal content, including images, videos, and audio provided via URLs. The function checks if the provided URL is a base64 data URI or a local file path (`os.path.isfile`). If neither is true, it falls back to treating the URL as a web URI and makes a direct HTTP GET request using `requests.get(url, stream=True).raw` without any validation or sanitization of the URL. Version 0.9.4 fixes the underlying issue.	7.6	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L

A BPv7 bundle with a malformed extension block causes uncontrolled memory allocation inside ION-DTN 4.1.3s, leading to receiver thread termination and a Denial-of-Service (DoS). The triggering bundle contains an extension block starting at `0x85070201005bbb0e20b4ea001a000927c0...`. The first byte in the extension block (0x85) indicates a CBOR array of five elements of which the first four are numbers (0x07, 0x02, 0x01, 0x00) but the fifth element is a byte string of length 27 (`0x5bbb0e20b4ea001a000927c0...`). The vulnerability seems to be due to processing the fifth element of the array (i.e., the byte string) as replacing it with a number makes the vulnerability no longer be triggered. While parsing this extension block, ION obtains a very large block length, which in the code in `bei.c`:764) seems to be passed from `blockLength` which is an unsigned int, to a 32 bit signed integer `blkSize`. The unsigned to signed conversion causes `blkSize` to hold the value of -369092043, which is then converted into a 64-bit unsigned value inside `MTAKE(blkSize)`, resulting in an attempt to allocate an unrealistic amount of memory, causing the error. As of time of publication, no known patched versions of BPv7 exist.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2025-61788	2025-10-08T18:15:35.407	2025-10-09T16:00:05.127	Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational audio and video content. Prior to Opencast 17.8 and 18.2, the paella would include and render some user inputs (metadata like title, description, etc.) unfiltered and unmodified. The vulnerability allows attackers to inject and malicious HTML and JavaScript in the player, which would then be executed in the browsers of users watching the prepared media. This can then be used to modify the site or to execute actions in the name of logged-in users. To inject malicious metadata, an attacker needs write access to the system. For example, the ability to upload media and modify metadata. This cannot be exploited by unauthenticated users. This issue is fixed in Opencast 17.8 and 18.2.	5.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

Prior to Opencast 17.8 and 18.2, in some situations, Opencast's editor may publish a video without notifying the user. This may lead to users accidentally publishing media not meant for publishing, and thus possibly exposing internal media. This risk of this actually impacting someone is very low, though. This can only be triggered by users with write access to an event. They also have to use the editor, which is usually an action taken if they want to publish media and not something users would use on internal media they do not want to publish. Finally, they have to first click on ""Save & Publish"" before then selecting the ""Save"" option. Nevertheless, while very unlikely, this can happen.

CVE-2017-20201	2025-10-08T22:15:30.767	2025-10-09T15:50:04.013	CCleaner v5.33.6162 and CCleaner Cloud v1.07.3191 (32-bit builds) contained a malicious pre-entry-point loader that diverts execution from __scrt_common_main_seh into a custom loader. That loader decodes an embedded blob into shellcode, allocates executable heap memory, resolves Windows API functions at runtime, and transfers execution to an in-memory payload. The payload performs anti-analysis checks, gathers host telemetry, encodes the data with a two-stage obfuscation, and attempts HTTPS exfiltration to hard-coded C2 servers or month-based DGA domains. Potential impacts include remote data collection and exfiltration, stealthy in-memory execution and persistence, and potential lateral movement. CCleaner was developed by Piriform, which was acquired by Avast in July 2017; Avast later merged with NortonLifeLock to form the parent company now known as Gen Digital. According to vendor advisories, the compromised CCleaner build was released on August 15, 2017 and remediated on September 12, 2017 with v5.34; the compromised CCleaner Cloud build was released on August 24, 2017 and remediated on September 15, 2017 with v1.07.3214.

Injected components enumerate common banner sizes for substitution, replace third-party ad calls, and redirect victim traffic to affiliate landing pages. Potential impacts include user-level code execution in the browser context, large-scale ad fraud and traffic hijacking, credential theft, and exposure to additional payloads delivered by the actor. The compromise was reported on by the maintainer of Web Developer for Chrome on August 2, 2017 and remediated in v0.5.0.

tcp: Clear tcp_sk(sk)->fastopen_rsk in tcp_disconnect().

syzbot reported the splat below where a socket had tcp_sk(sk)->fastopen_rsk

syzbot reused the server-side TCP Fast Open socket as a new client before
the TFO socket completes 3WHS:

  1. accept()
  2. connect(AF_UNSPEC)
  3. connect() to another destination

As of accept(), sk->sk_state is TCP_SYN_RECV, and tcp_disconnect() changes
it to TCP_CLOSE and makes connect() possible, which restarts timers.

Since tcp_disconnect() forgot to clear tcp_sk(sk)->fastopen_rsk, the
retransmit timer triggered the warning and the intended packet was not
retransmitted.

Let's call reqsk_fastopen_remove() in tcp_disconnect().

igc: don't fail igc_probe() on LED setup error

When igc_led_setup() fails, igc_probe() fails and triggers kernel panic
in free_netdev() since unregister_netdev() is not called. [1]
This behavior can be tested using fault-injection framework, especially
the failslab feature. [2]

Since LED support is not mandatory, treat LED setup failures as
non-fatal and continue probe with a warning message, consequently
avoiding the kernel panic.

CVE-2025-39958	2025-10-09T10:15:37.867	2025-10-09T15:50:04.013	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/s390: Make attach succeed when the device was surprise removed

When a PCI device is removed with surprise hotplug, there may still be
attempts to attach the device to the default domain as part of tear down
via (__iommu_release_dma_ownership()), or because the removal happens
during probe (__iommu_probe_device()). In both cases zpci_register_ioat()
fails with a cc value indicating that the device handle is invalid. This
is because the device is no longer part of the instance as far as the
hypervisor is concerned.

Currently this leads to an error return and s390_iommu_attach_device()
fails. This triggers the WARN_ON() in __iommu_group_set_domain_nofail()
because attaching to the default domain must never fail.

With the device fenced by the hypervisor no DMAs to or from memory are
possible and the IOMMU translations have no effect. Proceed as if the
registration was successful and let the hotplug event handling clean up
the device.

This is similar to how devices in the error state are handled since
commit 59bbf596791b (""iommu/s390: Make attach succeed even if the device
is in error state"") except that for removal the domain will not be
registered later. This approach was also previously discussed at the
link.

Handle both cases, error state and removal, in a helper which checks if
the error needs to be propagated or ignored. Avoid magic number
condition codes by using the pre-existing, but never used, defines for
PCI load/store condition codes and rename them to reflect that they
apply to all PCI instructions."

iommu/amd/pgtbl: Fix possible race while increase page table level

The AMD IOMMU host page table implementation supports dynamic page table levels
(up to 6 levels), starting with a 3-level configuration that expands based on
IOVA address. The kernel maintains a root pointer and current page table level
to enable proper page table walks in alloc_pte()/fetch_pte() operations.

The IOMMU IOVA allocator initially starts with 32-bit address and onces its
exhuasted it switches to 64-bit address (max address is determined based
on IOMMU and device DMA capability). To support larger IOVA, AMD IOMMU
driver increases page table level.

But in unmap path (iommu_v1_unmap_pages()), fetch_pte() reads
pgtable->[root/mode] without lock. So its possible that in exteme corner case,
when increase_address_space() is updating pgtable->[root/mode], fetch_pte()
reads wrong page table level (pgtable->mode). It does compare the value with
level encoded in page table and returns NULL. This will result is
iommu_unmap ops to fail and upper layer may retry/log WARN_ON.

CVE-2025-59146	2025-10-09T19:15:43.837	2025-10-09T19:15:43.837	New API is a large language mode (LLM) gateway and artificial intelligence (AI) asset management system. An authenticated Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in versions prior to 0.9.0.5. A feature within the application allows authenticated users to submit a URL for the server to process its content. The application fails to properly validate this user-supplied URL before making a server-side request. This vulnerability is not limited to image URLs and can be triggered with any link provided to the vulnerable endpoint. Since user registration is often enabled by default, any registered user can exploit this. By crafting a malicious URL, an attacker can coerce the server to send requests to arbitrary internal or external services. The vulnerability has been patched in version 0.9.0.5. The patch introduces a comprehensive, user-configurable SSRF protection module, which is enabled by default to protect server security. This new feature provides administrators with granular control over outbound requests made by the server. For users who cannot upgrade immediately, some temporary mitigation options are available. Enable new-api image processing worker (new-api-worker) and/or configure egress firewall rules.	8.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N

CVE-2025-61783	2025-10-09T21:15:40.127	2025-10-09T21:15:40.127	Python Social Auth is a social authentication/registration mechanism. In versions prior to 5.6.0, upon authentication, the user could be associated by e-mail even if the `associate_by_email` pipeline was not included. This could lead to account compromise when a third-party authentication service does not validate provided e-mail addresses or doesn't require unique e-mail addresses. Version 5.6.0 contains a patch. As a workaround, review the authentication service policy on e-mail addresses; many will not allow exploiting this vulnerability.					
CVE-2025-62240	2025-10-09T21:15:40.300	2025-10-09T21:15:40.300	Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities with Calendar events in Liferay Portal 7.4.3.35 through 7.4.3.111, and Liferay DXP 2023.Q4.0 through 2023.Q4.5, 2023.Q3.1 through 2023.Q3.7, 7.4 update 35 through update 92, and 7.3 update 25 through update 36 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted payload injected into a user’s (1) First Name, (2) Middle Name or (3) Last Name text field.					
CVE-2025-61926	2025-10-09T22:15:32.630	2025-10-09T22:15:32.630	Allstar is a GitHub App to set and enforce security policies. In versions prior to 4.5, a vulnerability in Allstar’s Reviewbot component caused inbound webhook requests to be validated against a hard-coded, shared secret. The value used for the secret token was compiled into the Allstar binary and could not be configured at runtime. In practice, this meant that every deployment using Reviewbot would validate requests with the same secret unless the operator modified source code and rebuilt the component - an expectation that is not documented and is easy to miss. All Allstar releases prior to v4.5 that include the Reviewbot code path are affected. Deployments on v4.5 and later are not affected. Those who have not enabled or exposed the Reviewbot endpoint are not exposed to this issue.					
CVE-2025-61928	2025-10-09T22:15:32.817	2025-10-10T15:16:06.660	Better Auth is an authentication and authorization library for TypeScript. In versions prior to 1.3.26, unauthenticated attackers can create or modify API keys for any user by passing that user's id in the request body to the `api/auth/api-key/create` route. `session?.user ?? (authRequired ? null : { id: ctx.body.userId })`. When no session exists but `userId` is present in the request body, `authRequired` becomes false and the user object is set to the attacker-controlled ID. Server-only field validation only executes when `authRequired` is true (lines 280-295), allowing attackers to set privileged fields. No additional authentication occurs before the database operation, so the malicious payload is accepted. The same pattern exists in the update endpoint. This is a critical authentication bypass enabling full an unauthenticated attacker can generate an API key for any user and immediately gain complete authenticated access. This allows the attacker to perform any action as the victim user using the api key, potentially compromise the user data and the application depending on the victim's privileges. Version 1.3.26 contains a patch for the issue.

CVE-2025-61780	2025-10-10T17:15:39.557	2025-10-10T17:15:39.557	"Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Prior to versions 2.2.20, 3.1.18, and 3.2.3, a possible information disclosure vulnerability existed in `Rack::Sendfile` when running behind a proxy that supports `x-sendfile` headers (such as Nginx). Specially crafted headers could cause `Rack::Sendfile` to miscommunicate with the proxy and trigger unintended internal requests, potentially bypassing proxy-level access restrictions. When `Rack::Sendfile` received untrusted `x-sendfile-type` or `x-accel-mapping` headers from a client, it would interpret them as proxy configuration directives. This could cause the middleware to send a ""redirect"" response to the proxy, prompting it to reissue a new internal request that was not subject to the proxy's access controls. An attacker could exploit this by setting a crafted `x-sendfile-type: x-accel-redirect` header, setting a crafted `x-accel-mapping` header, and requesting a path that qualifies for proxy-based acceleration. Attackers could bypass proxy-enforced restrictions and access internal endpoints intended to be protected (such as administrative pages). The vulnerability did not allow arbitrary file reads but could expose sensitive application routes. This issue only affected systems meeting all of the following conditions: The application used `Rack::Sendfile` with a proxy that supports `x-accel-redirect` (e.g., Nginx); the proxy did **not** always set or remove the `x-sendfile-type` and `x-accel-mapping` headers; and the application exposed an endpoint that returned a body responding to `.to_path`. Users should upgrade to Rack versions 2.2.20, 3.1.18, or 3.2.3, which require explicit configuration to enable `x-accel-redirect`. Alternatively, configure the proxy to always set or strip the header, or in Rails applications, disable sendfile completely."	5.8	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N

CVE-2025-61919	2025-10-10T20:15:37.730	2025-10-10T20:15:37.730	Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Prior to versions 2.2.20, 3.1.18, and 3.2.3, `Rack::Request#POST` reads the entire request body into memory for `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, calling `rack.input.read(nil)` without enforcing a length or cap. Large request bodies can therefore be buffered completely into process memory before parsing, leading to denial of service (DoS) through memory exhaustion. Users should upgrade to Rack version 2.2.20, 3.1.18, or 3.2.3, anu of which enforces form parameter limits using `query_parser.bytesize_limit`, preventing unbounded reads of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies. Additionally, enforce strict maximum body size at the proxy or web server layer (e.g., Nginx `client_max_body_size`, Apache `LimitRequestBody`).	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2025-61920	2025-10-10T20:15:37.893	2025-10-10T20:15:37.893	Authlib is a Python library which builds OAuth and OpenID Connect servers. Prior to version 1.6.5, Authlib’s JOSE implementation accepts unbounded JWS/JWT header and signature segments. A remote attacker can craft a token whose base64url‑encoded header or signature spans hundreds of megabytes. During verification, Authlib decodes and parses the full input before it is rejected, driving CPU and memory consumption to hostile levels and enabling denial of service. Version 1.6.5 patches the issue. Some temporary workarounds are available. Enforce input size limits before handing tokens to Authlib and/or use application-level throttling to reduce amplification risk.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2025-61921	2025-10-10T20:15:38.067	2025-10-10T20:15:38.067	Sinatra is a domain-specific language for creating web applications in Ruby. In versions prior to 4.2.0, there is a denial of service vulnerability in the `If-Match` and `If-None-Match` header parsing component of Sinatra, if the `etag` method is used when constructing the response. Carefully crafted input can cause `If-Match` and `If-None-Match` header parsing in Sinatra to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a denial of service attack vector. This header is typically involved in generating the `ETag` header value. Any applications that use the `etag` method when generating a response are impacted. Version 4.2.0 fixes the issue.					
CVE-2025-61925	2025-10-10T20:15:38.233	2025-10-10T20:15:38.233	Astro is a web framework. Prior to version 5.14.2, Astro reflects the value in `X-Forwarded-Host` in output when using `Astro.url` without any validation. It is common for web servers such as nginx to route requests via the `Host` header, and forward on other request headers. As such as malicious request can be sent with both a `Host` header and an `X-Forwarded-Host` header where the values do not match and the `X-Forwarded-Host` header is malicious. Astro will then return the malicious value. This could result in any usages of the `Astro.url` value in code being manipulated by a request. For example if a user follows guidance and uses `Astro.url` for a canonical link the canonical link can be manipulated to another site. It is theoretically possible that the value could also be used as a login/registration or other form URL as well, resulting in potential redirecting of login credentials to a malicious party. As this is a per-request attack vector the surface area would only be to the malicious user until one considers that having a caching proxy is a common setup, in which case any page which is cached could persist the malicious value for subsequent users. Many other frameworks have an allowlist of domains to validate against, or do not have a case where the headers are reflected to avoid such issues. This could affect anyone using Astro in an on-demand/dynamic rendering mode behind a caching proxy. Version 5.14.2 contains a fix for the issue.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L		
CVE-2025-61927	2025-10-10T20:15:38.430	2025-10-10T20:15:38.430	Happy DOM is a JavaScript implementation of a web browser without its graphical user interface. Happy DOM v19 and lower contains a security vulnerability that puts the owner system at the risk of RCE (Remote Code Execution) attacks. A Node.js VM Context is not an isolated environment, and if the user runs untrusted JavaScript code within the Happy DOM VM Context, it may escape the VM and get access to process level functionality. It seems like what the attacker can get control over depends on if the process is using ESM or CommonJS. With CommonJS the attacker can get hold of the `require()` function to import modules. Happy DOM has JavaScript evaluation enabled by default. This may not be obvious to the consumer of Happy DOM and can potentially put the user at risk if untrusted code is executed within the environment. Version 20.0.0 patches the issue by changing JavaScript evaluation to be disabled by default.					
CVE-2025-61929	2025-10-10T20:15:38.613	2025-10-10T20:15:38.613	Cherry Studio is a desktop client that supports for multiple LLM providers.

In the files `src/main/services/ProtocolClient.ts` and `src/main/services/urlschema/mcp-install.ts`, when receiving a URL of the `cherrystudio://mcp` type, the `handleMcpProtocolUrl` function is called for processing. If an attacker crafts malicious content and posts it on a website or elsewhere (there are many exploitation methods, such as creating a malicious website with a button containing this malicious content), when the user clicks it, since the pop-up window contains normal content, the direct click is considered a scene action, and the malicious command is directly triggered, leading to the user being compromised.

CVE-2025-61911	2025-10-10T22:15:37.470	2025-10-10T22:15:37.470	python-ldap is a lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) client API for Python. In versions prior to 3.4.5, the sanitization method `ldap.filter.escape_filter_chars` can be tricked to skip escaping of special characters when a crafted `list` or `dict` is supplied as the `assertion_value` parameter, and the non-default `escape_mode=1` is configured. The method `ldap.filter.escape_filter_chars` supports 3 different escaping modes. `escape_mode=0` (default) and `escape_mode=2` happen to raise exceptions when a `list` or `dict` object is supplied as the `assertion_value` parameter. However, `escape_mode=1` computes without performing adequate logic to ensure a fully escaped return value. If an application relies on the vulnerable method in the `python-ldap` library to escape untrusted user input, an attacker might be able to abuse the vulnerability to launch ldap injection attacks which could potentially disclose or manipulate ldap data meant to be inaccessible to them. Version 3.4.5 fixes the issue by adding a type check at the start of the `ldap.filter.escape_filter_chars` method to raise an exception when the supplied `assertion_value` parameter is not of type `str`.					
CVE-2025-61912	2025-10-10T22:15:37.637	2025-10-10T22:15:37.637	python-ldap is a lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) client API for Python. In versions prior to 3.4.5, ldap.dn.escape_dn_chars() escapes \x00 incorrectly by emitting a backslash followed by a literal NUL byte instead of the RFC-4514 hex form \00. Any application that uses this helper to construct DNs from untrusted input can be made to consistently fail before a request is sent to the LDAP server (e.g., AD), resulting in a client-side denial of service. Version 3.4.5 contains a patch for the issue.

CVE-2025-52885	2025-10-10T23:15:36.397	2025-10-10T23:15:36.397	Poppler ia a library for rendering PDF files, and examining or modifying their structure. A use-after-free (write) vulnerability has been detected in versions Poppler prior to 25.10.0 within the StructTreeRoot class. The issue arises from the use of raw pointers to elements of a `std::vector`, which can lead to dangling pointers when the vector is resized. The vulnerability stems from the way that refToParentMap stores references to `std::vector` elements using raw pointers. These pointers may become invalid when the vector is resized. This vulnerability is a common security problem involving the use of raw pointers to `std::vectors`. Internally, `std::vector `stores its elements in a dynamically allocated array. When the array reaches its capacity and a new element is added, the vector reallocates a larger block of memory and moves all the existing elements to the new location. At this point if any pointers to elements are stored before a resize occurs, they become dangling pointers once the reallocation happens. Version 25.10.0 contains a patch for the issue.					
CVE-2025-62159	2025-10-10T23:15:36.560	2025-10-10T23:15:36.560	External Secrets Operator reads information from a third-party service and automatically injects the values as Kubernetes Secrets. A vulnerability was discovered in the BeyondTrust provider implementation for External Secrets Operator versions 0.10.1 through 0.19.2. The provider previously retrieved Kubernetes secrets directly, without validating the namespace context or the type of secret store. This allowed unauthorized cross-namespace secret access, violating security boundaries and potentially exposing sensitive credentials. In version 0.20.0, the provider code was updated to use the `resolvers.SecretKeyRef` utility, which enforces namespace validation and only allows cross-namespace access for `ClusterSecretStore` types. This ensures secrets are only retrieved from the correct namespace, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access. All users should upgrade to the latest version containing this fix. As a workaround, use a policy engine such as Kyverno or OPA to prevent using BeyondTrust provider and/or validate the `(Cluster)SecretStore` and ensure the namespace may only be set when using a `ClusterSecretStore`.
