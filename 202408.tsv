CVE-2024-3056	2024-08-02T21:16:30.950	2024-12-27T16:15:24.437	A flaw was found in Podman. This issue may allow an attacker to create a specially crafted container that, when configured to share the same IPC with at least one other container, can create a large number of IPC resources in /dev/shm. The malicious container will continue to exhaust resources until it is out-of-memory (OOM) killed. While the malicious container's cgroup will be removed, the IPC resources it created are not. Those resources are tied to the IPC namespace that will not be removed until all containers using it are stopped, and one non-malicious container is holding the namespace open. The malicious container is restarted, either automatically or by attacker control, repeating the process and increasing the amount of memory consumed. With a container configured to restart always, such as `podman run --restart=always`, this can result in a memory-based denial of service of the system.	7.7	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-42350	2024-08-05T20:15:36.697	2024-08-06T16:30:24.547	Biscuit is an authorization token with decentralized verification, offline attenuation and strong security policy enforcement based on a logic language. Third-party blocks can be generated without transferring the whole token to the third-party authority. Instead, a `ThirdPartyBlock` request can be sent, providing only the necessary info to generate a third-party block and to sign it: 1. the public key of the previous block (used in the signature), 2. the public keys part of the token symbol table (for public key interning in datalog expressions). A third-part block request forged by a malicious user can trick the third-party authority into generating datalog trusting the wrong keypair. Tokens with third-party blocks containing `trusted` annotations generated through a third party block request. This has been addressed in version 4 of the specification. Users are advised to update their implementations to conform. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	3.0	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N

CVE-2024-23657	2024-08-05T21:15:37.880	2024-09-20T12:49:35.743	Nuxt is a free and open-source framework to create full-stack web applications and websites with Vue.js. Nuxt Devtools is missing authentication on the `getTextAssetContent` RPC function which is vulnerable to path traversal.  Combined with a lack of Origin checks on the WebSocket handler,  an attacker is able to interact with a locally running devtools instance and exfiltrate data abusing this vulnerability. In certain configurations an attacker could leak the devtools authentication token and then abuse other RPC functions to achieve RCE. The `getTextAssetContent` function does not check for path traversals, this could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files over the RPC WebSocket. The WebSocket server does not check the origin of the request leading to cross-site-websocket-hijacking. This may be intentional to allow certain configurations to work correctly. Nuxt Devtools authentication tokens are placed within the home directory of the current user. The malicious webpage can connect to the Devtools WebSocket, perform a directory traversal brute force to find the authentication token, then use the *authenticated* `writeStaticAssets` function to create a new Component, Nitro Handler or `app.vue` file which will run automatically as the file is changed. This vulnerability has been addressed in release version 1.3.9. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2024-34343	2024-08-05T21:15:38.257	2024-09-19T19:57:52.007	"Nuxt is a free and open-source framework to create full-stack web applications and websites with Vue.js. The `navigateTo` function attempts to blockthe `javascript:` protocol, but does not correctly use API's provided by `unjs/ufo`. This library also contains parsing discrepancies.  The function first tests to see if the specified URL has a protocol. This uses the unjs/ufo package for URL parsing. This function works effectively, and returns true for a javascript: protocol. After this, the URL is parsed using the parseURL function. This function will refuse to parse poorly formatted URLs. Parsing javascript:alert(1) returns null/"""" for all values. Next, the protocol of the URL is then checked using the isScriptProtocol function. This function simply checks the input against a list of protocols, and does not perform any parsing. The combination of refusing to parse poorly formatted URLs, and not performing additional parsing means that script checks fail as no protocol can be found. Even if a protocol was identified, whitespace is not stripped in the parseURL implementation, bypassing the isScriptProtocol checks. Certain special protocols are identified at the top of parseURL. Inserting a newline or tab into this sequence will block the special protocol check, and bypass the latter checks. This ONLY has impact after SSR has occured, the `javascript:` protocol within a location header does not trigger XSS. This issue has been addressed in release version 3.12.4 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."	6.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

Due to the insufficient validation of the `path` parameter in the NuxtTestComponentWrapper, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript on the server side, which allows them to execute arbitrary commands. Users who open a malicious web page in the browser while running the test locally are affected by this vulnerability, which results in the remote code execution from the malicious web page. Since web pages can send requests to arbitrary addresses, a malicious web page can repeatedly try to exploit this vulnerability, which then triggers the exploit when the test server starts.	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2024-42352	2024-08-05T21:15:38.913	2024-09-19T20:55:46.543	Nuxt is a free and open-source framework to create full-stack web applications and websites with Vue.js. `nuxt/icon` provides an API to allow client side icon lookup. This endpoint is at `/api/_nuxt_icon/[name]`. The proxied request path is improperly parsed, allowing an attacker to change the scheme and host of the request. This leads to SSRF, and could potentially lead to sensitive data exposure. The `new URL` constructor is used to parse the final path. This constructor can be passed a relative scheme or path in order to change the host the request is sent to. This constructor is also very tolerant of poorly formatted URLs. As a result we can pass a path prefixed with the string `http:`. This has the effect of changing the scheme to HTTP. We can then subsequently pass a new host, for example `http:127.0.0.1:8080`. This would allow us to send requests to a local server. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.4.5 and all users are advised to upgrade.

CVE-2024-42358	2024-08-06T17:15:54.103	2024-08-12T18:50:20.967	PDFio is a simple C library for reading and writing PDF files. There is a denial of service (DOS) vulnerability in the TTF parser. Maliciously crafted TTF files can cause the program to utilize 100% of the Memory and enter an infinite loop. This can also lead to a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability. An infinite loop occurs in the read_camp function by nGroups value. The ttf.h library is vulnerable. A value called nGroups is extracted from the file, and by changing that value, you can cause the program to utilize 100% of the Memory and enter an infinite loop. If the value of nGroups in the file is small, an infinite loop will not occur. This library, whether used as a standalone binary or as part of another application, is vulnerable to DOS attacks when parsing certain types of files. Automated systems, including web servers that use this code to convert PDF submissions into plaintext, can be DOSed if an attacker uploads a malicious TTF file. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.3.1. All users are advised to upgrade.

A potential mutation XSS vulnerability exists in Qwik for versions up to but not including 1.6.0. Qwik improperly escapes HTML on server-side rendering. It converts strings according to the rules found in the `render-ssr.ts` file. It sometimes causes the situation that the final DOM tree rendered on browsers is different from what Qwik expects on server-side rendering. This may be leveraged to perform XSS attacks, and a type of the XSS is known as mXSS (mutation XSS). This has been resolved in qwik version 1.6.0 and @builder.io/qwik version 1.7.3.

libceph: fix race between delayed_work() and ceph_monc_stop()

The way the delayed work is handled in ceph_monc_stop() is prone to
races with mon_fault() and possibly also finish_hunting().  Both of
these can requeue the delayed work which wouldn't be canceled by any of
the following code in case that happens after cancel_delayed_work_sync()
runs -- __close_session() doesn't mess with the delayed work in order
to avoid interfering with the hunting interval logic.  This part was
missed in commit b5d91704f53e (""libceph: behave in mon_fault() if
cur_mon < 0"") and use-after-free can still ensue on monc and objects
that hang off of it, with monc->auth and monc->monmap being
particularly susceptible to quickly being reused.

To fix this:

- clear monc->cur_mon and monc->hunting as part of closing the session
  in ceph_monc_stop()
- bail from delayed_work() if monc->cur_mon is cleared, similar to how
  it's done in mon_fault() and finish_hunting() (based on monc->hunting)

The vmf->ptl in filemap_fault_recheck_pte_none() is still set from

After a pte_unmap(vmf->pte) unmap and rcu_read_unlock(), the page table

table.  Fix this by replacing pte_offset_map() with
pte_offset_map_nolock().

As David said, the PTL pointer might be stale so if we continue to use
it infilemap_fault_recheck_pte_none(), it might trigger UAF.  Also, if

Even on 6.10-rc6, I've been seeing elusive ""Bad page state""s (often on
flags when freeing, yet the flags shown are not bad: PG_locked had been
set and cleared??), and VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(page_ref_count(page) == 0)s from
deferred_split_scan()'s folio_put(), and a variety of other BUG and WARN
symptoms implying double free by deferred split and large folio migration.

6.7 commit 9bcef5973e31 (""mm: memcg: fix split queue list crash when large
folio migration"") was right to fix the memcg-dependent locking broken in
85ce2c517ade (""memcontrol: only transfer the memcg data for migration""),
but missed a subtlety of deferred_split_scan(): it moves folios to its own
local list to work on them without split_queue_lock, during which time
folio->_deferred_list is not empty, but even the ""right"" lock does nothing
to secure the folio and the list it is on.

Fortunately, deferred_split_scan() is careful to use folio_try_get(): so
folio_migrate_mapping() can avoid the race by folio_undo_large_rmappable()
while the old folio's reference count is temporarily frozen to 0 - adding
such a freeze in the !mapping case too (originally, folio lock and
unmapping and no swap cache left an anon folio unreachable, so no freezing
was needed there: but the deferred split queue offers a way to reach it)."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

bpf: Fail bpf_timer_cancel when callback is being cancelled

Given a schedule:

timer1 cb			timer2 cb

bpf_timer_cancel(timer2);	bpf_timer_cancel(timer1);

Both bpf_timer_cancel calls would wait for the other callback to finish
executing, introducing a lockup.

Add an atomic_t count named 'cancelling' in bpf_hrtimer. This keeps
track of all in-flight cancellation requests for a given BPF timer.
Whenever cancelling a BPF timer, we must check if we have outstanding
cancellation requests, and if so, we must fail the operation with an
error (-EDEADLK) since cancellation is synchronous and waits for the
callback to finish executing. This implies that we can enter a deadlock
situation involving two or more timer callbacks executing in parallel
and attempting to cancel one another.

Note that we avoid incrementing the cancelling counter for the target
timer (the one being cancelled) if bpf_timer_cancel is not invoked from
a callback, to avoid spurious errors. The whole point of detecting
cur->cancelling and returning -EDEADLK is to not enter a busy wait loop
(which may or may not lead to a lockup). This does not apply in case the
caller is in a non-callback context, the other side can continue to
cancel as it sees fit without running into errors.

Background on prior attempts:

Earlier versions of this patch used a bool 'cancelling' bit and used the
following pattern under timer->lock to publish cancellation status.

lock(t->lock);
t->cancelling = true;
mb();
if (cur->cancelling)
	return -EDEADLK;
unlock(t->lock);
hrtimer_cancel(t->timer);
t->cancelling = false;

The store outside the critical section could overwrite a parallel
requests t->cancelling assignment to true, to ensure the parallely
executing callback observes its cancellation status.

It would be necessary to clear this cancelling bit once hrtimer_cancel
is done, but lack of serialization introduced races. Another option was
explored where bpf_timer_start would clear the bit when (re)starting the
timer under timer->lock. This would ensure serialized access to the
cancelling bit, but may allow it to be cleared before in-flight
hrtimer_cancel has finished executing, such that lockups can occur
again.

Thus, we choose an atomic counter to keep track of all outstanding
cancellation requests and use it to prevent lockups in case callbacks
attempt to cancel each other while executing in parallel."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

x86/bhi: Avoid warning in #DB handler due to BHI mitigation

When BHI mitigation is enabled, if SYSENTER is invoked with the TF flag set
then entry_SYSENTER_compat() uses CLEAR_BRANCH_HISTORY and calls the
clear_bhb_loop() before the TF flag is cleared. This causes the #DB handler
(exc_debug_kernel()) to issue a warning because single-step is used outside the
entry_SYSENTER_compat() function.

To address this issue, entry_SYSENTER_compat() should use CLEAR_BRANCH_HISTORY
after making sure the TF flag is cleared.

The problem can be reproduced with the following sequence:

  $ cat sysenter_step.c
  int main()
  { asm(""pushf; pop %ax; bts $8,%ax; push %ax; popf; sysenter""); }

  $ gcc -o sysenter_step sysenter_step.c

  $ ./sysenter_step
  Segmentation fault (core dumped)

The program is expected to crash, and the #DB handler will issue a warning.

USB: serial: mos7840: fix crash on resume

Since commit c49cfa917025 (""USB: serial: use generic method if no
alternative is provided in usb serial layer""), USB serial core calls the
generic resume implementation when the driver has not provided one.

This can trigger a crash on resume with mos7840 since support for
multiple read URBs was added back in 2011. Specifically, both port read
URBs are now submitted on resume for open ports, but the context pointer
of the second URB is left set to the core rather than mos7840 port
structure.

Fix this by implementing dedicated suspend and resume functions for
mos7840.

Tested with Delock 87414 USB 2.0 to 4x serial adapter.

This reverts commit b0defa7ae03ecf91b8bfd10ede430cff12fcbd06.

b0defa7ae03ec changed the load balancing logic to ignore env.max_loop if
all tasks examined to that point were pinned. The goal of the patch was
to make it more likely to be able to detach a task buried in a long list
of pinned tasks. However, this has the unfortunate side effect of
creating an O(n) iteration in detach_tasks(), as we now must fully
iterate every task on a cpu if all or most are pinned. Since this load
balance code is done with rq lock held, and often in softirq context, it
is very easy to trigger hard lockups. We observed such hard lockups with
a user who affined O(10k) threads to a single cpu.

When I discussed this with Vincent he initially suggested that we keep
the limit on the number of tasks to detach, but increase the number of
tasks we can search. However, after some back and forth on the mailing
list, he recommended we instead revert the original patch, as it seems

Ensure that `i2c_lock' is held when setting interrupt latch and mask in

The other (non-probe) call site pca953x_gpio_set_multiple() ensures the
lock is held before calling pca953x_write_regs().

The problem occurred when a request raced against irq_bus_sync_unlock()

cifs: Fix server re-repick on subrequest retry

When a subrequest is marked for needing retry, netfs will call
cifs_prepare_write() which will make cifs repick the server for the op
before renegotiating credits; it then calls cifs_issue_write() which
invokes smb2_async_writev() - which re-repicks the server.

If a different server is then selected, this causes the increment of
server->in_flight to happen against one record and the decrement to happen
against another, leading to misaccounting.

Fix this by just removing the repick code in smb2_async_writev().  As this
is only called from netfslib-driven code, cifs_prepare_write() should
always have been called first, and so server should never be NULL and the
preparatory step is repeated in the event that we do a retry.

The problem manifests as a warning looking something like:

CVE-2024-42367	2024-08-12T13:38:34.240	2025-08-19T15:12:45.730	aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. In versions on the 3.10 branch prior to version 3.10.2, static routes which contain files with compressed variants (`.gz` or `.br` extension) are vulnerable to path traversal outside the root directory if those variants are symbolic links. The server protects static routes from path traversal outside the root directory when `follow_symlinks=False` (default).  It does this by resolving the requested URL to an absolute path and then checking that path relative to the root. However, these checks are not performed when looking for compressed variants in the `FileResponse` class, and symbolic links are then automatically followed when performing the `Path.stat()` and `Path.open()` to send the file.

CVE-2024-42467	2024-08-12T13:38:34.740	2024-08-29T16:26:43.947	openHAB, a provider of open-source home automation software, has add-ons including the visualization add-on CometVisu. Prior to version 4.2.1, the proxy endpoint of openHAB's CometVisu add-on can be accessed without authentication. This proxy-feature can be exploited as Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to induce GET HTTP requests to internal-only servers, in case openHAB is exposed in a non-private network. Furthermore, this proxy-feature can also be exploited as a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, as an attacker is able to re-route a request to their server and return a page with malicious JavaScript code. Since the browser receives this data directly from the openHAB CometVisu UI, this JavaScript code will be executed with the origin of the CometVisu UI. This allows an attacker to exploit call endpoints on an openHAB server even if the openHAB server is located in a private network. (e.g. by sending an openHAB admin a link that proxies malicious JavaScript.) This issue may lead up to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when chained with other vulnerabilities. Users should upgrade to version 4.2.1 of the CometVisu add-on of openHAB to receive a patch.	10.0	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N

CVE-2024-42368	2024-08-13T20:15:08.447	2024-08-14T02:07:05.410	OpenTelemetry, also known as OTel, is a vendor-neutral open source Observability framework for instrumenting, generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. The bearertokenauth extension's server authenticator performs a simple, non-constant time string comparison of the received & configured bearer tokens. This impacts anyone using the `bearertokenauth` server authenticator. Malicious clients with network access to the collector may perform a timing attack against a collector with this authenticator to guess the configured token, by iteratively sending tokens and comparing the response time. This would allow an attacker to introduce fabricated or bad data into the collector's telemetry pipeline. The observable timing vulnerability was fixed by using constant-time comparison in  0.107.0	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L

This vulnerability is a bypass of the fix put in place for GHSA-qjqp-xr96-cj99. In pull request 1149, sanitation was added for Trix attachments with a `text/html` content type. However, Trix only checks the content type on the paste event's `dataTransfer` object. As long as the `dataTransfer` has a content type of `text/html`, Trix parses its contents and creates an `Attachment` with them, even if the attachment itself doesn't have a `text/html` content type. Trix then uses the attachment content to set the attachment element's `innerHTML`. An attacker could trick a user to copy and paste malicious code that would execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's session, potentially leading to unauthorized actions being performed or sensitive information being disclosed.

CVE-2024-42472	2024-08-15T19:15:19.233	2025-08-19T15:21:28.073	"Flatpak is a Linux application sandboxing and distribution framework. Prior to versions 1.14.0 and 1.15.10, a malicious or compromised Flatpak app using persistent directories could access and write files outside of what it would otherwise have access to, which is an attack on integrity and confidentiality.

When `persistent=subdir` is used in the application permissions (represented as `--persist=subdir` in the command-line interface), that means that an application which otherwise doesn't have access to the real user home directory will see an empty home directory with a writeable subdirectory `subdir`. Behind the scenes, this directory is actually a bind mount and the data is stored in the per-application directory as `~/.var/app/$APPID/subdir`. This allows existing apps that are not aware of the per-application directory to still work as intended without general home directory access.

However, the application does have write access to the application directory `~/.var/app/$APPID` where this directory is stored. If the source directory for the `persistent`/`--persist` option is replaced by a symlink, then the next time the application is started, the bind mount will follow the symlink and mount whatever it points to into the sandbox.

Partial protection against this vulnerability can be provided by patching Flatpak using the patches in commits ceec2ffc and 98f79773. However, this leaves a race condition that could be exploited by two instances of a malicious app running in parallel. Closing the race condition requires updating or patching the version of bubblewrap that is used by Flatpak to add the new `--bind-fd` option using the patch and then patching Flatpak to use it. If Flatpak has been configured at build-time with `-Dsystem_bubblewrap=bwrap` (1.15.x) or `--with-system-bubblewrap=bwrap` (1.14.x or older), or a similar option, then the version of bubblewrap that needs to be patched is a system copy that is distributed separately, typically `/usr/bin/bwrap`. This configuration is the one that is typically used in Linux distributions. If Flatpak has been configured at build-time with `-Dsystem_bubblewrap=` (1.15.x) or with `--without-system-bubblewrap` (1.14.x or older), then it is the bundled version of bubblewrap that is included with Flatpak that must be patched. This is typically installed as `/usr/libexec/flatpak-bwrap`. This configuration is the default when building from source code.

For the 1.14.x stable branch, these changes are included in Flatpak 1.14.10. The bundled version of bubblewrap included in this release has been updated to 0.6.3. For the 1.15.x development branch, these changes are included in Flatpak 1.15.10. The bundled version of bubblewrap in this release is a Meson ""wrap"" subproject, which has been updated to 0.10.0. The 1.12.x and 1.10.x branches will not be updated for this vulnerability. Long-term support OS distributions should backport the individual changes into their versions of Flatpak and bubblewrap, or update to newer versions if their stability policy allows it. As a workaround, avoid using applications using the `persistent` (`--persist`) permission."	10.0	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2024-42475	2024-08-15T19:15:19.520	2024-08-19T13:00:23.117	In the OAuth library for nim prior to version 0.11, the `state` values generated by the `generateState` function do not have sufficient entropy. These can be successfully guessed by an attacker allowing them to perform a CSRF vs a user, associating the user's session with the attacker's protected resources. While `state` isn't exactly a cryptographic value, it should be generated in a cryptographically secure way. `generateState` should be using a CSPRNG. Version 0.11 modifies the `generateState` function to generate `state` values of at least 128 bits of entropy while using a CSPRNG.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

When this project is compiled with certain compiler flags set, it is possible that the `state` parameter will not be checked at all, creating a CSRF vulnerability. Version 0.11 checks the `state` parameter using a regular `if` statement or `doAssert` instead of relying on a plain `assert`. `doAssert` will achieve the desired behavior even if `-d:danger` or `--assertions:off` is set.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVE-2024-43357	2024-08-15T19:15:20.107	2024-08-19T13:00:23.117	"ECMA-262 is the language specification for the scripting language ECMAScript. A problem in the ECMAScript (JavaScript) specification of async generators, introduced by a May 2021 spec refactor, may lead to mis-implementation in a way that could present as a security vulnerability, such as type confusion and pointer dereference.

The internal async generator machinery calls regular promise resolver functions on IteratorResult (`{ done, value }`) objects that it creates, assuming that the IteratorResult objects will not be then-ables. Unfortunately, these IteratorResult objects inherit from `Object.prototype`, so these IteratorResult objects can be made then-able, triggering arbitrary behaviour, including re-entering the async generator machinery in a way that violates some internal invariants.

The ECMAScript specification is a living standard and the issue has been addressed at the time of this advisory's public disclosure. JavaScript engine implementors should refer to the latest specification and update their implementations to comply with the `AsyncGenerator` section.

CVE-2024-43367	2024-08-15T21:15:17.777	2024-08-19T13:00:23.117	Boa is an embeddable and experimental Javascript engine written in Rust. Starting in version 0.16 and prior to version 0.19.0, a wrong assumption made when handling ECMAScript's `AsyncGenerator` operations can cause an uncaught exception on certain scripts. Boa's implementation of `AsyncGenerator` makes the assumption that the state of an `AsyncGenerator` object cannot change while resolving a promise created by methods of `AsyncGenerator` such as `%AsyncGeneratorPrototype%.next`, `%AsyncGeneratorPrototype%.return`, or `%AsyncGeneratorPrototype%.throw`. However, a carefully constructed code could trigger a state transition from a getter method for the promise's `then` property, which causes the engine to fail an assertion of this assumption, causing an uncaught exception. This could be used to create a Denial Of Service attack in applications that run arbitrary ECMAScript code provided by an external user. Version 0.19.0 is patched to correctly handle this case. Users unable to upgrade to the patched version would want to use `std::panic::catch_unwind` to ensure any exceptions caused by the engine don't impact the availability of the main application.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-43374	2024-08-16T02:15:17.687	2025-08-25T13:51:58.377	The UNIX editor Vim prior to version 9.1.0678 has a use-after-free error in argument list handling. When adding a new file to the argument list, this triggers `Buf*` autocommands. If in such an autocommand the buffer that was just opened is closed (including the window where it is shown), this causes the window structure to be freed which contains a reference to the argument list that we are actually modifying. Once the autocommands are completed, the references to the window and argument list are no longer valid and as such cause an use-after-free. Impact is low since the user must either intentionally add some unusual autocommands that wipe a buffer during creation (either manually or by sourcing a malicious plugin), but it will crash Vim. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0678.	4.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L		
CVE-2024-43378	2024-08-16T02:15:17.877	2024-08-19T13:00:23.117	calamares-nixos-extensions provides Calamares branding and modules for NixOS, a distribution of GNU/Linux. Users who installed NixOS through the graphical installer who used manual disk partitioning to create a setup where the system was booted via legacy BIOS rather than UEFI; some disk partitions are encrypted; but the partitions containing either `/` or `/boot` are unencrypted; have their LUKS disk encryption key file in plain text either in `/crypto_keyfile.bin`, or in a CPIO archive attached to their NixOS initrd. `nixos-install` is not affected, nor are UEFI installations, nor was the default automatic partitioning configuration on legacy BIOS systems. The problem has been fixed in calamares-nixos-extensions 0.3.17, which was included in NixOS. The current installer images for the NixOS 24.05 and unstable (24.11) channels are unaffected. The fix reached 24.05 at 2024-08-13 20:06:59 UTC, and unstable at 2024-08-15 09:00:20 UTC. Installer images downloaded before those times may be vulnerable. The best solution for affected users is probably to back up their data and do a complete reinstallation. However, the mitigation procedure in GHSA-3rvf-24q2-24ww should work solely for the case where `/` is encrypted but `/boot` is not. If `/` is unencrypted, then the `/crypto_keyfile.bin` file will need to be deleted in addition to the remediation steps in the previous advisory. This issue is a partial regression of CVE-2023-36476 / GHSA-3rvf-24q2-24ww, which was more severe as it applied to the default configuration on BIOS systems.	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N

In versions on the 1.15.x branch prior to 1.15.8 and the 1.16.x branch prior to 1.16.1, ReferenceGrant changes are not correctly propagated in Cilium's GatewayAPI controller, which could lead to Gateway resources being able to access secrets for longer than intended, or to Routes having the ability to forward traffic to backends in other namespaces for longer than intended. This issue has been patched in Cilium v1.15.8 and v1.16.1. As a workaround, any modification of a related Gateway/HTTPRoute/GRPCRoute/TCPRoute CRD (for example, adding any label to any of these resources) will trigger a reconciliation of ReferenceGrants on an affected cluster.	5.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N		
CVE-2024-43381	2024-08-16T15:15:29.000	2024-09-11T13:02:26.053	reNgine is an automated reconnaissance framework for web applications. Versions 2.1.2 and prior are susceptible to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This vulnerability occurs when scanning a domain, and if the target domain's DNS record contains an XSS payload, it leads to the execution of malicious scripts in the reNgine's dashboard view when any user views the scan results. The XSS payload is directly fetched from the DNS record of the remote target domain. Consequently, an attacker can execute the attack without requiring any additional input from the target or the reNgine user. A patch is available and expected to be part of version 2.1.3.	5.0	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

The problem is that iptable_nat_table_init() is exposed to user space

Note that bh_lock_sock() is not serializing the tasklet context against
process context, because the check for sock_owned_by_user() and
corresponding handling is missing.

Ideas for a future clean-up patch:
A) Correct usage of bh_lock_sock() in tasklet context, as described in
Re-enqueue, if needed. This may require adding return values to the
tasklet functions and thus changes to all users of iucv.

B) Change iucv tasklet into worker and use only lock_sock() in af_iucv."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

arm64: mm: Fix lockless walks with static and dynamic page-table folding

Lina reports random oopsen originating from the fast GUP code when
16K pages are used with 4-level page-tables, the fourth level being
folded at runtime due to lack of LPA2.

In this configuration, the generic implementation of
p4d_offset_lockless() will return a 'p4d_t *' corresponding to the
'pgd_t' allocated on the stack of the caller, gup_fast_pgd_range().
This is normally fine, but when the fourth level of page-table is folded
at runtime, pud_offset_lockless() will offset from the address of the
'p4d_t' to calculate the address of the PUD in the same page-table page.
This results in a stray stack read when the 'p4d_t' has been allocated
on the stack and can send the walker into the weeds.

Fix the problem by providing our own definition of p4d_offset_lockless()
when CONFIG_PGTABLE_LEVELS <= 4 which returns the real page-table

PCI/DPC: Fix use-after-free on concurrent DPC and hot-removal

Keith reports a use-after-free when a DPC event occurs concurrently to
hot-removal of the same portion of the hierarchy:

The dpc_handler() awaits readiness of the secondary bus below the
Downstream Port where the DPC event occurred.  To do so, it polls the
config space of the first child device on the secondary bus.  If that
child device is concurrently removed, accesses to its struct pci_dev
cause the kernel to oops.

That's because pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus() neglects to hold a
reference on the child device.  Before v6.3, the function was only
called on resume from system sleep or on runtime resume.  Holding a
reference wasn't necessary back then because the pciehp IRQ thread
could never run concurrently.  (On resume from system sleep, IRQs are
not enabled until after the resume_noirq phase.  And runtime resume is
always awaited before a PCI device is removed.)

However starting with v6.3, pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus() is also
called on a DPC event.  Commit 53b54ad074de (""PCI/DPC: Await readiness
of secondary bus after reset""), which introduced that, failed to
appreciate that pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus() now needs to hold a
reference on the child device because dpc_handler() and pciehp may
indeed run concurrently.  The commit was backported to v5.10+ stable
kernels, so that's the oldest one affected.

Add the missing reference acquisition.

[...]
============================================

The immediate cause of this problem is that there is only one valid dentry
for the block to be split during do_split, so split==0 results in out of
bounds accesses to the map triggering the issue.

    do_split
      unsigned split
      dx_make_map
       count = 1
      split = count/2 = 0;
      continued = hash2 == map[split - 1].hash;
       ---> map[4294967295]

The maximum length of a filename is 255 and the minimum block size is 1024,
so it is always guaranteed that the number of entries is greater than or
equal to 2 when do_split() is called.

But syzbot's crafted image has no dot and dotdot in dir, and the dentry
distribution in dirblock is as follows:

  bus     dentry1          hole           dentry2           free
|xx--|xx-------------|...............|xx-------------|...............|
0   12 (8+248)=256  268     256     524 (8+256)=264 788     236     1024

So when renaming dentry1 increases its name_len length by 1, neither hole
nor free is sufficient to hold the new dentry, and make_indexed_dir() is
called.

In make_indexed_dir() it is assumed that the first two entries of the
dirblock must be dot and dotdot, so bus and dentry1 are left in dx_root
because they are treated as dot and dotdot, and only dentry2 is moved
to the new leaf block. That's why count is equal to 1.

Therefore add the ext4_check_dx_root() helper function to add more sanity
checks to dot and dotdot before starting the conversion to avoid the above
issue."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

evict_folios() uses a second pass to reclaim folios that have gone through
page writeback and become clean before it finishes the first pass, since
folio_rotate_reclaimable() cannot handle those folios due to the
isolation.

The second pass tries to avoid potential double counting by deducting
scan_control->nr_scanned.  However, this can result in underflow of
nr_scanned, under a condition where shrink_folio_list() does not increment
nr_scanned, i.e., when folio_trylock() fails.

The underflow can cause the divisor, i.e., scale=scanned+reclaimed in

landlock: Don't lose track of restrictions on cred_transfer

When a process' cred struct is replaced, this _almost_ always invokes
the cred_prepare LSM hook; but in one special case (when
KEYCTL_SESSION_TO_PARENT updates the parent's credentials), the
cred_transfer LSM hook is used instead.  Landlock only implements the
cred_prepare hook, not cred_transfer, so KEYCTL_SESSION_TO_PARENT causes
all information on Landlock restrictions to be lost.

This basically means that a process with the ability to use the fork()
and keyctl() syscalls can get rid of all Landlock restrictions on
itself.

Fix it by adding a cred_transfer hook that does the same thing as the
existing cred_prepare hook. (Implemented by having hook_cred_prepare()
call hook_cred_transfer() so that the two functions are less likely to
accidentally diverge in the future.)"	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

mailbox: mtk-cmdq: Move devm_mbox_controller_register() after devm_pm_runtime_enable()

When mtk-cmdq unbinds, a WARN_ON message with condition

According to the call tracei below:
  cmdq_mbox_shutdown
  mbox_free_channel
  mbox_controller_unregister
  __devm_mbox_controller_unregister
  ...

The root cause can be deduced to be calling pm_runtime_get_sync() after
calling pm_runtime_disable() as observed below:
1. CMDQ driver uses devm_mbox_controller_register() in cmdq_probe()
   to bind the cmdq device to the mbox_controller, so
   devm_mbox_controller_unregister() will automatically unregister
   the device bound to the mailbox controller when the device-managed
   resource is removed. That means devm_mbox_controller_unregister()
   and cmdq_mbox_shoutdown() will be called after cmdq_remove().
2. CMDQ driver also uses devm_pm_runtime_enable() in cmdq_probe() after
   devm_mbox_controller_register(), so that devm_pm_runtime_disable()
   will be called after cmdq_remove(), but before
   devm_mbox_controller_unregister().

To fix this problem, cmdq_probe() needs to move
devm_mbox_controller_register() after devm_pm_runtime_enable() to make
devm_pm_runtime_disable() be called after
devm_mbox_controller_unregister()."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

iio: Fix the sorting functionality in iio_gts_build_avail_time_table

The sorting in iio_gts_build_avail_time_table is not working as intended.
It could result in an out-of-bounds access when the time is zero.

Here are more details:

1. When the gts->itime_table[i].time_us is zero, e.g., the time
sequence is `3, 0, 1`, the inner for-loop will not terminate and do
out-of-bound writes. This is because once `times[j] > new`, the value
`new` will be added in the current position and the `times[j]` will be
moved to `j+1` position, which makes the if-condition always hold.
Meanwhile, idx will be added one, making the loop keep running without
termination and out-of-bound write.
2. If none of the gts->itime_table[i].time_us is zero, the elements
will just be copied without being sorted as described in the comment
""Sort times from all tables to one and remove duplicates"".

xdp: fix invalid wait context of page_pool_destroy()

If the driver uses a page pool, it creates a page pool with
page_pool_create().
The reference count of page pool is 1 as default.
A page pool will be destroyed only when a reference count reaches 0.
page_pool_destroy() is used to destroy page pool, it decreases a
reference count.
When a page pool is destroyed, ->disconnect() is called, which is
mem_allocator_disconnect().
This function internally acquires mutex_lock().

If the driver uses XDP, it registers a memory model with
xdp_rxq_info_reg_mem_model().
The xdp_rxq_info_reg_mem_model() internally increases a page pool
reference count if a memory model is a page pool.
Now the reference count is 2.

To destroy a page pool, the driver should call both page_pool_destroy()
and xdp_unreg_mem_model().
The xdp_unreg_mem_model() internally calls page_pool_destroy().
Only page_pool_destroy() decreases a reference count.

If a driver calls page_pool_destroy() then xdp_unreg_mem_model(), we
will face an invalid wait context warning.
Because xdp_unreg_mem_model() calls page_pool_destroy() with
rcu_read_lock().
The page_pool_destroy() internally acquires mutex_lock().

To fix this problem, it uses rhashtable_lookup_fast() instead of
rhashtable_lookup() with rcu_read_lock().
Using xa without rcu_read_lock() here is safe.
xa is freed by __xdp_mem_allocator_rcu_free() and this is called by
call_rcu() of mem_xa_remove().
The mem_xa_remove() is called by page_pool_destroy() if a reference
count reaches 0.
The xa is already protected by the reference count mechanism well in the
control plane.

One way to fix it is by forcing `attach_prog_fd` non-empty when
bpf_prog_load(). But this will lead to `libbpf_probe_bpf_prog_type`
API broken which use verifier log to probe prog type and will log
nothing if we reject invalid EXT prog before bpf_check().

Another way is by adding null check in resolve_prog_type().

The issue was introduced by commit 4a9c7bbe2ed4 (""bpf: Resolve to
prog->aux->dst_prog->type only for BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT"") which wanted
to correct type resolution for BPF_PROG_TYPE_TRACING programs. Before
that, the type resolution of BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT prog actually follows
the logic below:

  prog->aux->dst_prog ? prog->aux->dst_prog->type : prog->type;

It implies that when EXT program is not yet attached to `dst_prog`,
the prog type should be EXT itself. This code worked fine in the past.
So just keep using it.

Fix this by returning `prog->type` for BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT if `dst_prog`
is not present in resolve_prog_type()."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

lib: objagg: Fix general protection fault

The library supports aggregation of objects into other objects only if
the parent object does not have a parent itself. That is, nesting is not
supported.

Aggregation happens in two cases: Without and with hints, where hints
are a pre-computed recommendation on how to aggregate the provided
objects.

Nesting is not possible in the first case due to a check that prevents
it, but in the second case there is no check because the assumption is
that nesting cannot happen when creating objects based on hints. The
violation of this assumption leads to various warnings and eventually to
a general protection fault [1].

Before fixing the root cause, error out when nesting happens and warn.

cgroup/cpuset: Prevent UAF in proc_cpuset_show()

An UAF can happen when /proc/cpuset is read as reported in [1].

This can be reproduced by the following methods:
1.add an mdelay(1000) before acquiring the cgroup_lock In the
 cgroup_path_ns function.
2.$cat /proc/<pid>/cpuset   repeatly.
3.$mount -t cgroup -o cpuset cpuset /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/
$umount /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/   repeatly.

The race that cause this bug can be shown as below:

(umount)		|	(cat /proc/<pid>/cpuset)
css_release		|	proc_cpuset_show
css_release_work_fn	|	css = task_get_css(tsk, cpuset_cgrp_id);
css_free_rwork_fn	|	cgroup_path_ns(css->cgroup, ...);
cgroup_destroy_root	|	mutex_lock(&cgroup_mutex);
rebind_subsystems	|
cgroup_free_root 	|
			|	// cgrp was freed, UAF
			|	cgroup_path_ns_locked(cgrp,..);

When the cpuset is initialized, the root node top_cpuset.css.cgrp
will point to &cgrp_dfl_root.cgrp. In cgroup v1, the mount operation will
allocate cgroup_root, and top_cpuset.css.cgrp will point to the allocated
&cgroup_root.cgrp. When the umount operation is executed,
top_cpuset.css.cgrp will be rebound to &cgrp_dfl_root.cgrp.

The problem is that when rebinding to cgrp_dfl_root, there are cases
where the cgroup_root allocated by setting up the root for cgroup v1
is cached. This could lead to a Use-After-Free (UAF) if it is
subsequently freed. The descendant cgroups of cgroup v1 can only be
freed after the css is released. However, the css of the root will never
be released, yet the cgroup_root should be freed when it is unmounted.
This means that obtaining a reference to the css of the root does
not guarantee that css.cgrp->root will not be freed.

Fix this problem by using rcu_read_lock in proc_cpuset_show().
As cgroup_root is kfree_rcu after commit d23b5c577715
(""cgroup: Make operations on the cgroup root_list RCU safe""),
css->cgroup won't be freed during the critical section.
To call cgroup_path_ns_locked, css_set_lock is needed, so it is safe to
replace task_get_css with task_css.

md: fix deadlock between mddev_suspend and flush bio

Deadlock occurs when mddev is being suspended while some flush bio is in
progress. It is a complex issue.

T1. the first flush is at the ending stage, it clears 'mddev->flush_bio'
    and tries to submit data, but is blocked because mddev is suspended
    by T4.
T2. the second flush sets 'mddev->flush_bio', and attempts to queue
    md_submit_flush_data(), which is already running (T1) and won't
    execute again if on the same CPU as T1.
T3. the third flush inc active_io and tries to flush, but is blocked because
    'mddev->flush_bio' is not NULL (set by T2).
T4. mddev_suspend() is called and waits for active_io dec to 0 which is inc
    by T3.

  T1		T2		T3		T4
  (flush 1)	(flush 2)	(third 3)	(suspend)
  md_submit_flush_data
   mddev->flush_bio = NULL;
   .
   .	 	md_flush_request
   .	  	 mddev->flush_bio = bio
   .	  	 queue submit_flushes

   .		 .		md_handle_request

   .		 queue_work md_submit_flush_data
   .		 //md_submit_flush_data is already running (T1)
   .
   md_handle_request
    wait resume

The root issue is non-atomic inc/dec of active_io during flush process.
active_io is dec before md_submit_flush_data is queued, and inc soon
after md_submit_flush_data() run.
  md_flush_request
    active_io + 1
    submit_flushes
      active_io - 1

        md_handle_request
        active_io + 1
          make_request
        active_io - 1

If active_io is dec after md_handle_request() instead of within
submit_flushes(), make_request() can be called directly intead of
md_handle_request() in md_submit_flush_data(), and active_io will
only inc and dec once in the whole flush process. Deadlock will be
fixed.

Additionally, the only difference between fixing the issue and before is
that there is no return error handling of make_request(). But after
previous patch cleaned md_write_start(), make_requst() only return error
in raid5_make_request() by dm-raid, see commit 41425f96d7aa (""dm-raid456,
md/raid456: fix a deadlock for dm-raid456 while io concurrent with
reshape)"". Since dm always splits data and flush operation into two
separate io, io size of flush submitted by dm always is 0, make_request()
will not be called in md_submit_flush_data(). To prevent future
modifications from introducing issues, add WARN_ON to ensure
make_request() no error is returned in this context."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

dma: fix call order in dmam_free_coherent

dmam_free_coherent() frees a DMA allocation, which makes the
freed vaddr available for reuse, then calls devres_destroy()
to remove and free the data structure used to track the DMA
allocation. Between the two calls, it is possible for a
concurrent task to make an allocation with the same vaddr

If this happens, there will be two entries in the devres list

Fix by destroying the devres entry before freeing the DMA
allocation.

remoteproc: imx_rproc: Skip over memory region when node value is NULL

In imx_rproc_addr_init() ""nph = of_count_phandle_with_args()"" just counts
number of phandles. But phandles may be empty. So of_parse_phandle() in
the parsing loop (0 < a < nph) may return NULL which is later dereferenced.
Adjust this issue by adding NULL-return check.

Introduce a version of the fence ops that on release doesn't remove

vmwgfx overwrites the wait callback to iterate over the list of all
fences and update their status, to do that it holds a lock to prevent
the list modifcations from other threads. The fence destroy callback
both deletes the fence and removes it from the list of pending
fences, for which it holds a lock.

dma buf polling cb unrefs a fence after it's been signaled: so the poll
calls the wait, which signals the fences, which are being destroyed.
The destruction tries to acquire the lock on the pending fences list
which it can never get because it's held by the wait from which it
was called.

PCI: rcar: Demote WARN() to dev_warn_ratelimited() in rcar_pcie_wakeup()

Avoid large backtrace, it is sufficient to warn the user that there has
been a link problem. Either the link has failed and the system is in need
of maintenance, or the link continues to work and user has been informed.
The message from the warning can be looked up in the sources.

This makes an actual link issue less verbose.

First of all, this controller has a limitation in that the controller
driver has to assist the hardware with transition to L1 link state by
writing L1IATN to PMCTRL register, the L1 and L0 link state switching
is not fully automatic on this controller.

In case of an ASMedia ASM1062 PCIe SATA controller which does not support
ASPM, on entry to suspend or during platform pm_test, the SATA controller
enters D3hot state and the link enters L1 state. If the SATA controller
wakes up before rcar_pcie_wakeup() was called and returns to D0, the link
returns to L0 before the controller driver even started its transition to
L1 link state. At this point, the SATA controller did send an PM_ENTER_L1
DLLP to the PCIe controller and the PCIe controller received it, and the
PCIe controller did set PMSR PMEL1RX bit.

Once rcar_pcie_wakeup() is called, if the link is already back in L0 state
and PMEL1RX bit is set, the controller driver has no way to determine if
it should perform the link transition to L1 state, or treat the link as if
it is in L0 state. Currently the driver attempts to perform the transition
to L1 link state unconditionally, which in this specific case fails with a
PMSR L1FAEG poll timeout, however the link still works as it is already
back in L0 state.

Reduce this warning verbosity. In case the link is really broken, the
rcar_pcie_config_access() would fail, otherwise it will succeed and any
system with this controller and ASM1062 can suspend without generating
a backtrace."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

mlxsw: spectrum_acl_erp: Fix object nesting warning

ACLs in Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs can reside in the algorithmic TCAM
(A-TCAM) or in the ordinary circuit TCAM (C-TCAM). The former can
contain more ACLs (i.e., tc filters), but the number of masks in each
region (i.e., tc chain) is limited.

In order to mitigate the effects of the above limitation, the device
allows filters to share a single mask if their masks only differ in up
to 8 consecutive bits. For example, dst_ip/25 can be represented using
dst_ip/24 with a delta of 1 bit. The C-TCAM does not have a limit on the
number of masks being used (and therefore does not support mask
aggregation), but can contain a limited number of filters.

The driver uses the ""objagg"" library to perform the mask aggregation by
passing it objects that consist of the filter's mask and whether the
filter is to be inserted into the A-TCAM or the C-TCAM since filters in
different TCAMs cannot share a mask.

The set of created objects is dependent on the insertion order of the
filters and is not necessarily optimal. Therefore, the driver will
periodically ask the library to compute a more optimal set (""hints"") by
looking at all the existing objects.

When the library asks the driver whether two objects can be aggregated
the driver only compares the provided masks and ignores the A-TCAM /
C-TCAM indication. This is the right thing to do since the goal is to
move as many filters as possible to the A-TCAM. The driver also forbids
two identical masks from being aggregated since this can only happen if
one was intentionally put in the C-TCAM to avoid a conflict in the
A-TCAM.

The above can result in the following set of hints:

H1: {mask X, A-TCAM} -> H2: {mask Y, A-TCAM} // X is Y + delta
H3: {mask Y, C-TCAM} -> H4: {mask Z, A-TCAM} // Y is Z + delta

After getting the hints from the library the driver will start migrating
filters from one region to another while consulting the computed hints
and instructing the device to perform a lookup in both regions during
the transition.

Assuming a filter with mask X is being migrated into the A-TCAM in the
new region, the hints lookup will return H1. Since H2 is the parent of
H1, the library will try to find the object associated with it and
create it if necessary in which case another hints lookup (recursive)
will be performed. This hints lookup for {mask Y, A-TCAM} will either
return H2 or H3 since the driver passes the library an object comparison
function that ignores the A-TCAM / C-TCAM indication.

This can eventually lead to nested objects which are not supported by
the library [1].

Fix by removing the object comparison function from both the driver and
the library as the driver was the only user. That way the lookup will
only return exact matches.

I do not have a reliable reproducer that can reproduce the issue in a
timely manner, but before the fix the issue would reproduce in several
minutes and with the fix it does not reproduce in over an hour.

Note that the current usefulness of the hints is limited because they
include the C-TCAM indication and represent aggregation that cannot
actually happen. This will be addressed in net-next.

wifi: ath12k: change DMA direction while mapping reinjected packets

For fragmented packets, ath12k reassembles each fragment as a normal
packet and then reinjects it into HW ring. In this case, the DMA
direction should be DMA_TO_DEVICE, not DMA_FROM_DEVICE. Otherwise,
an invalid payload may be reinjected into the HW and
subsequently delivered to the host.

Given that arbitrary memory can be allocated to the skb buffer,
knowledge about the data contained in the reinjected buffer is lacking.
Consequently, there’s a risk of private information being leaked.

CVE-2024-43882	2024-08-21T01:15:12.340	2024-12-10T19:15:26.840	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exec: Fix ToCToU between perm check and set-uid/gid usage

When opening a file for exec via do_filp_open(), permission checking is
done against the file's metadata at that moment, and on success, a file
pointer is passed back. Much later in the execve() code path, the file
metadata (specifically mode, uid, and gid) is used to determine if/how
to set the uid and gid. However, those values may have changed since the
permissions check, meaning the execution may gain unintended privileges.

For example, if a file could change permissions from executable and not
set-id:

---------x 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

to set-id and non-executable:

---S------ 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

it is possible to gain root privileges when execution should have been
disallowed.

While this race condition is rare in real-world scenarios, it has been
observed (and proven exploitable) when package managers are updating
the setuid bits of installed programs. Such files start with being
world-executable but then are adjusted to be group-exec with a set-uid
bit. For example, ""chmod o-x,u+s target"" makes ""target"" executable only
by uid ""root"" and gid ""cdrom"", while also becoming setuid-root:

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

becomes:

-rwsr-xr-- 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target

But racing the chmod means users without group ""cdrom"" membership can
get the permission to execute ""target"" just before the chmod, and when
the chmod finishes, the exec reaches brpm_fill_uid(), and performs the
setuid to root, violating the expressed authorization of ""only cdrom
group members can setuid to root"".

Re-check that we still have execute permissions in case the metadata
has changed. It would be better to keep a copy from the perm-check time,
but until we can do that refactoring, the least-bad option is to do a
full inode_permission() call (under inode lock). It is understood that
this is safe against dead-locks, but hardly optimal."	7.0	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

dmaengine: idxd: Let probe fail when workqueue cannot be enabled

The workqueue is enabled when the appropriate driver is loaded and
disabled when the driver is removed. When the driver is removed it
assumes that the workqueue was enabled successfully and proceeds to
free allocations made during workqueue enabling.

Failure during workqueue enabling does not prevent the driver from
being loaded. This is because the error path within drv_enable_wq()
returns success unless a second failure is encountered
during the error path. By returning success it is possible to load
the driver even if the workqueue cannot be enabled and
allocations that do not exist are attempted to be freed during
driver remove.

Some examples of problematic flows:
(a)

 idxd_dmaengine_drv_probe() -> drv_enable_wq() -> idxd_wq_request_irq():
 In above flow, if idxd_wq_request_irq() fails then
 idxd_wq_unmap_portal() is called on error exit path, but
 drv_enable_wq() returns 0 because idxd_wq_disable() succeeds. The
 driver is thus loaded successfully.

 idxd_dmaengine_drv_remove()->drv_disable_wq()->idxd_wq_unmap_portal()
 Above flow on driver unload triggers the WARN in devm_iounmap() because
 the device resource has already been removed during error path of
 drv_enable_wq().

(b)

 idxd_dmaengine_drv_probe() -> drv_enable_wq() -> idxd_wq_request_irq():
 In above flow, if idxd_wq_request_irq() fails then
 idxd_wq_init_percpu_ref() is never called to initialize the percpu

misc: fastrpc: Fix use-after-free race condition for maps

It is possible that in between calling fastrpc_map_get() until
map->fl->lock is taken in fastrpc_free_map(), another thread can call
fastrpc_map_lookup() and get a reference to a map that is about to be
deleted.

Rewrite fastrpc_map_get() to only increase the reference count of a map
if it's non-zero. Propagate this to callers so they can know if a map is
about to be deleted.

channel index is used to access the child's channel_stats. So the array
has to be at least as large as the parent's rx queue size for the
counting to work correctly and to prevent out of bound accesses.

net/mlx5: Fix command stats access after free

Command may fail while driver is reloading and can't accept FW commands
till command interface is reinitialized. Such command failure is being
logged to command stats. This results in NULL pointer access as command
stats structure is being freed and reallocated during mlx5 devlink
reload (see kernel log below).

Fix it by making command stats statically allocated on driver probe.

sched/core: Fix use-after-free bug in dup_user_cpus_ptr()

Since commit 07ec77a1d4e8 (""sched: Allow task CPU affinity to be
restricted on asymmetric systems""), the setting and clearing of
user_cpus_ptr are done under pi_lock for arm64 architecture. However,
dup_user_cpus_ptr() accesses user_cpus_ptr without any lock
protection. Since sched_setaffinity() can be invoked from another
process, the process being modified may be undergoing fork() at
the same time.  When racing with the clearing of user_cpus_ptr in
__set_cpus_allowed_ptr_locked(), it can lead to user-after-free and
possibly double-free in arm64 kernel.

Commit 8f9ea86fdf99 (""sched: Always preserve the user requested
cpumask"") fixes this problem as user_cpus_ptr, once set, will never
be cleared in a task's lifetime. However, this bug was re-introduced
in commit 851a723e45d1 (""sched: Always clear user_cpus_ptr in
do_set_cpus_allowed()"") which allows the clearing of user_cpus_ptr in
do_set_cpus_allowed(). This time, it will affect all arches.

Fix this bug by always clearing the user_cpus_ptr of the newly
cloned/forked task before the copying process starts and check the
user_cpus_ptr state of the source task under pi_lock.

Note to stable, this patch won't be applicable to stable releases.

There are 3 possible interrupt sources are handled by DP controller,

At every irq, DP controller have to check isr status of every interrupt
sources and service the interrupt if its isr status bits shows interrupts
are pending. There is potential race condition may happen at current aux
isr handler implementation since it is always complete dp_aux_cmd_fifo_tx()
even irq is not for aux read or write transaction. This may cause aux read
transaction return premature if host aux data read is in the middle of
waiting for sink to complete transferring data to host while irq happen.
This will cause host's receiving buffer contains unexpected data. This
patch fixes this problem by checking aux isr and return immediately at
aux isr handler if there are no any isr status bits set.

Current there is a bug report regrading eDP edid corruption happen during
system booting up. After lengthy debugging to found that VIDEO_READY
interrupt was continuously firing during system booting up which cause
dp_aux_isr() to complete dp_aux_cmd_fifo_tx() prematurely to retrieve data

usb: gadget: f_ncm: fix potential NULL ptr deref in ncm_bitrate()

In Google internal bug 265639009 we've received an (as yet) unreproducible
crash report from an aarch64 GKI 5.10.149-android13 running device.

AFAICT the source code is at:
  https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/refs/tags/ASB-2022-12-05_13-5.10

The call stack is:
  ncm_close() -> ncm_notify() -> ncm_do_notify()
with the crash at:
  ncm_do_notify+0x98/0x270
Code: 79000d0b b9000a6c f940012a f9400269 (b9405d4b)

Which I believe disassembles to (I don't know ARM assembly, but it looks sane enough to me...):

  // halfword (16-bit) store presumably to event->wLength (at offset 6 of struct usb_cdc_notification)
  0B 0D 00 79    strh w11, [x8, #6]

  // word (32-bit) store presumably to req->Length (at offset 8 of struct usb_request)
  6C 0A 00 B9    str  w12, [x19, #8]

  // x10 (NULL) was read here from offset 0 of valid pointer x9
  // IMHO we're reading 'cdev->gadget' and getting NULL
  // gadget is indeed at offset 0 of struct usb_composite_dev
  2A 01 40 F9    ldr  x10, [x9]

  // loading req->buf pointer, which is at offset 0 of struct usb_request
  69 02 40 F9    ldr  x9, [x19]

  // x10 is null, crash, appears to be attempt to read cdev->gadget->max_speed
  4B 5D 40 B9    ldr  w11, [x10, #0x5c]

which seems to line up with ncm_do_notify() case NCM_NOTIFY_SPEED code fragment:

  event->wLength = cpu_to_le16(8);
  req->length = NCM_STATUS_BYTECOUNT;

  /* SPEED_CHANGE data is up/down speeds in bits/sec */
  data = req->buf + sizeof *event;
  data[0] = cpu_to_le32(ncm_bitrate(cdev->gadget));

My analysis of registers and NULL ptr deref crash offset
  (Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 000000000000005c)
heavily suggests that the crash is due to 'cdev->gadget' being NULL when executing:
  data[0] = cpu_to_le32(ncm_bitrate(cdev->gadget));
which calls:
  ncm_bitrate(NULL)
which then calls:
  gadget_is_superspeed(NULL)
which reads
  ((struct usb_gadget *)NULL)->max_speed
and hits a panic.

AFAICT, if I'm counting right, the offset of max_speed is indeed 0x5C.
(remember there's a GKI KABI reservation of 16 bytes in struct work_struct)

It's not at all clear to me how this is all supposed to work...
but returning 0 seems much better than panic-ing..."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

io_uring/poll: don't reissue in case of poll race on multishot request

A previous commit fixed a poll race that can occur, but it's only
applicable for multishot requests. For a multishot request, we can safely
ignore a spurious wakeup, as we never leave the waitqueue to begin with.

A blunt reissue of a multishot armed request can cause us to leak a
buffer, if they are ring provided. While this seems like a bug in itself,
it's not really defined behavior to reissue a multishot request directly.
It's less efficient to do so as well, and not required to rearm anything
like it is for singleshot poll requests."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

btrfs: fix race between quota rescan and disable leading to NULL pointer deref

If we have one task trying to start the quota rescan worker while another
one is trying to disable quotas, we can end up hitting a race that results
in the quota rescan worker doing a NULL pointer dereference. The steps for
this are the following:

1) Quotas are enabled;

2) Task A calls the quota rescan ioctl and enters btrfs_qgroup_rescan().
   It calls qgroup_rescan_init() which returns 0 (success) and then joins a
   transaction and commits it;

3) Task B calls the quota disable ioctl and enters btrfs_quota_disable().
   It clears the bit BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED from fs_info->flags and calls
   btrfs_qgroup_wait_for_completion(), which returns immediately since the
   rescan worker is not yet running.
   Then it starts a transaction and locks fs_info->qgroup_ioctl_lock;

4) Task A queues the rescan worker, by calling btrfs_queue_work();

5) The rescan worker starts, and calls rescan_should_stop() at the start
   of its while loop, which results in 0 iterations of the loop, since
   the flag BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED was cleared from fs_info->flags by
   task B at step 3);

6) Task B sets fs_info->quota_root to NULL;

7) The rescan worker tries to start a transaction and uses
   fs_info->quota_root as the root argument for btrfs_start_transaction().
   This results in a NULL pointer dereference down the call chain of
   btrfs_start_transaction(). The stack trace is something like the one
   reported in Link tag below:

[CAUSE]
Since commit e15e9f43c7ca (""btrfs: introduce
BTRFS_QGROUP_RUNTIME_FLAG_NO_ACCOUNTING to skip qgroup accounting""), if
our qgroup is already in inconsistent state, we will no longer do the
time-consuming backref walk.

This can leave some qgroup records without a valid old_roots ulist.
Normally this is fine, as btrfs_qgroup_account_extents() would also skip
those records if we have NO_ACCOUNTING flag set.

But there is a small window, if we have NO_ACCOUNTING flag set, and
inserted some qgroup_record without a old_roots ulist, but then the user
triggered a qgroup rescan.

During btrfs_qgroup_rescan(), we firstly clear NO_ACCOUNTING flag, then
commit current transaction.

And since we have a qgroup_record with old_roots = NULL, we trigger the
WARN_ON() during btrfs_qgroup_account_extents().

[FIX]
Unfortunately due to the introduction of NO_ACCOUNTING flag, the
assumption that every qgroup_record would have its old_roots populated
is no longer correct.

Fix the false alerts and drop the WARN_ON()."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

This patch fixes the root cause of this problem by replacing the error
code that __nilfs_btree_get_block() returns on block address conversion
failure from -ENOENT to another internal code -EINVAL which means that the
b-tree metadata is corrupted.

By returning -EINVAL, it propagates without glitches, and for all relevant
b-tree operations, functions in the upper bmap layer output an error
message indicating corrupted b-tree metadata via
nilfs_bmap_convert_error(), and code -EIO will be eventually returned as
it should be."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

net/sched: act_mpls: Fix warning during failed attribute validation

The 'TCA_MPLS_LABEL' attribute is of 'NLA_U32' type, but has a
validation type of 'NLA_VALIDATE_FUNCTION'. This is an invalid
combination according to the comment above 'struct nla_policy':

""
Meaning of `validate' field, use via NLA_POLICY_VALIDATE_FN:
   NLA_BINARY           Validation function called for the attribute.
   All other            Unused - but note that it's a union
""

This can trigger the warning [1] in nla_get_range_unsigned() when
validation of the attribute fails. Despite being of 'NLA_U32' type, the
associated 'min'/'max' fields in the policy are negative as they are
aliased by the 'validate' field.

Fix by changing the attribute type to 'NLA_BINARY' which is consistent
with the above comment and all other users of NLA_POLICY_VALIDATE_FN().
As a result, move the length validation to the validation function.

nfsd: fix handling of cached open files in nfsd4_open codepath

Commit fb70bf124b05 (""NFSD: Instantiate a struct file when creating a
regular NFSv4 file"") added the ability to cache an open fd over a
compound. There are a couple of problems with the way this currently
works:

It's racy, as a newly-created nfsd_file can end up with its PENDING bit
cleared while the nf is hashed, and the nf_file pointer is still zeroed
out. Other tasks can find it in this state and they expect to see a
valid nf_file, and can oops if nf_file is NULL.

Also, there is no guarantee that we'll end up creating a new nfsd_file
if one is already in the hash. If an extant entry is in the hash with a
valid nf_file, nfs4_get_vfs_file will clobber its nf_file pointer with
the value of op_file and the old nf_file will leak.

Fix both issues by making a new nfsd_file_acquirei_opened variant that
takes an optional file pointer. If one is present when this is called,
we'll take a new reference to it instead of trying to open the file. If
the nfsd_file already has a valid nf_file, we'll just ignore the
optional file and pass the nfsd_file back as-is.

Also rework the tracepoints a bit to allow for an ""opened"" variant and
don't try to avoid counting acquisitions in the case where we already
have a cached open file."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

iommu/iova: Fix alloc iova overflows issue

In __alloc_and_insert_iova_range, there is an issue that retry_pfn
overflows. The value of iovad->anchor.pfn_hi is ~0UL, then when
iovad->cached_node is iovad->anchor, curr_iova->pfn_hi + 1 will
overflow. As a result, if the retry logic is executed, low_pfn is
updated to 0, and then new_pfn < low_pfn returns false to make the
allocation successful.

This issue occurs in the following two situations:
1. The first iova size exceeds the domain size. When initializing
iova domain, iovad->cached_node is assigned as iovad->anchor. For
example, the iova domain size is 10M, start_pfn is 0x1_F000_0000,
and the iova size allocated for the first time is 11M. The
following is the log information, new->pfn_lo is smaller than
iovad->cached_node.

Example log as follows:
[  223.798112][T1705487] sh: [name:iova&]__alloc_and_insert_iova_range
start_pfn:0x1f0000,retry_pfn:0x0,size:0xb00,limit_pfn:0x1f0a00
[  223.799590][T1705487] sh: [name:iova&]__alloc_and_insert_iova_range
success start_pfn:0x1f0000,new->pfn_lo:0x1efe00,new->pfn_hi:0x1f08ff

2. The node with the largest iova->pfn_lo value in the iova domain
is deleted, iovad->cached_node will be updated to iovad->anchor,
and then the alloc iova size exceeds the maximum iova size that can
be allocated in the domain.

After judging that retry_pfn is less than limit_pfn, call retry_pfn+1
to fix the overflow issue."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

There are a number of CKAN plugins, including XLoader, DataPusher, Resource proxy and ckanext-archiver, that work by downloading the contents of local or remote files in order to perform some actions with their contents (e.g. pushing to the DataStore, streaming contents or saving a local copy). All of them use the resource URL, and there are currently no checks to limit what URLs can be requested. This means that a malicious (or unaware) user can create a resource with a URL pointing to a place where they should not have access in order for one of the previous tools to retrieve it (known as a Server Side Request Forgery). Users wanting to protect against these kinds of attacks can use one or a combination of the following approaches: (1) Use a separate HTTP proxy like Squid that can be used to allow / disallow IPs, domains etc as needed, and make CKAN extensions aware of this setting via the ckan.download_proxy config option. (2) Implement custom firewall rules to prevent access to restricted resources. (3) Use custom validators on the resource url field to block/allow certain domains or IPs. All latest versions of the plugins listed above support the ckan.download_proxy settings. Support for this setting in the Resource Proxy plugin was included in CKAN 2.10.5 and 2.11.0.	4.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

A potential vulnerability has been discovered in CKEditor 4 Code Snippet GeSHi plugin. The vulnerability allowed a reflected XSS attack by exploiting a flaw in the GeSHi syntax highlighter library hosted by the victim. The GeSHi library was included as a vendor dependency in CKEditor 4 source files. In a specific scenario, an attacker could craft a malicious script that could be executed by sending a request to the GeSHi library hosted on a PHP web server. The GeSHi library is no longer actively maintained. Due to the lack of ongoing support and updates, potential security vulnerabilities have been identified with its continued use. To mitigate these risks and enhance the overall security of the CKEditor 4, we have decided to completely remove the GeSHi library as a dependency. This change aims to maintain a secure environment and reduce the risk of any security incidents related to outdated or unsupported software. The fix is be available in version 4.25.0-lts.	6.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

But this length is entirely untrusted and can be set to any value by the client, causing this much memory to be allocated, which will cause the process to OOM within a few such requests.

which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference on failure of
kzalloc().

Fix this bug by adding a check of tmpbuf.

This bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysis employs
differential checking to identify inconsistent security operations
(e.g., checks or kfrees) between two code paths and confirms that the
inconsistent operations are not recovered in the current function or
the callers, so they constitute bugs.

Note that, as a bug found by static analysis, it can be a false

Normally snapshot deletion and relocation are excluded from running at
the same time by the fs_info->cleaner_mutex.  However if we had a
pending balance waiting to get the ->cleaner_mutex, and a snapshot
deletion was running, and then the box crashed, we would come up in a
state where we have a half deleted snapshot.

Again, in the normal case the snapshot deletion needs to complete before
relocation can start, but in this case relocation could very well start
before the snapshot deletion completes, as we simply add the root to the
dead roots list and wait for the next time the cleaner runs to clean up
the snapshot.

Fix this by setting a bit on the fs_info if we have any DEAD_ROOT's that
had a pending drop_progress key.  If they do then we know we were in the
middle of the drop operation and set a flag on the fs_info.  Then
balance can wait until this flag is cleared to start up again.

If there are DEAD_ROOT's that don't have a drop_progress set then we're
safe to start balance right away as we'll be properly protected by the
cleaner_mutex."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

This was partially fixed by c2e39305299f01 (""btrfs: clear extent buffer
uptodate when we fail to write it""), however all that fix did was keep
us from finding extent buffers after a failed writeout.  It didn't keep
us from continuing to use a buffer that we already had found.

In this case we're searching the commit root to cache the block group,
so we can start committing the transaction and switch the commit root
and then start writing.  After the switch we can look up an extent
buffer that hasn't been written yet and start processing that block
group.  Then we fail to write that block out and clear Uptodate on the
page, and then we start spewing these errors.

Normally we're protected by the tree lock to a certain degree here.  If
we read a block we have that block read locked, and we block the writer
from locking the block before we submit it for the write.  However this
isn't necessarily fool proof because the read could happen before we do
the submit_bio and after we locked and unlocked the extent buffer.

Also in this particular case we have path->skip_locking set, so that
won't save us here.  We'll simply get a block that was valid when we
read it, but became invalid while we were using it.

What we really want is to catch the case where we've ""read"" a block but
it's not marked Uptodate.  On read we ClearPageError(), so if we're
!Uptodate and !Error we know we didn't do the right thing for reading
the page.

Fix this by checking !Uptodate && !Error, this way we will not complain
if our buffer gets invalidated while we're using it, and we'll maintain
the spirit of the check which is to make sure we have a fully in-cache
block while we're messing with it."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

net/smc: fix connection leak

There's a potential leak issue under following execution sequence :

smc_release  				smc_connect_work

					send_clc_confirim
	tcp_abort();
					...

Unfortunately, tcp_abort() may discard CLC CONFIRM messages that are
still in the tcp send buffer, in which case our connection token cannot
be delivered to the server side, which means that we cannot get a
passive close message at all. Therefore, it is impossible for the to be
disconnected at all.

This patch tries a very simple way to avoid this issue, once the state
has changed to SMC_ACTIVE after tcp_abort(), we can actively abort the
smc connection, considering that the state is SMC_INIT before
tcp_abort(), abandoning the complete disconnection process should not
cause too much problem.

In fact, this problem may exist as long as the CLC CONFIRM message is
not received by the server. Whether a timer should be added after
smc_close_final() needs to be discussed in the future. But even so, this
patch provides a faster release for connection in above case, it should

net: ipv6: ensure we call ipv6_mc_down() at most once

There are two reasons for addrconf_notify() to be called with NETDEV_DOWN:
either the network device is actually going down, or IPv6 was disabled
on the interface.

If either of them stays down while the other is toggled, we repeatedly
call the code for NETDEV_DOWN, including ipv6_mc_down(), while never
calling the corresponding ipv6_mc_up() in between. This will cause a
new entry in idev->mc_tomb to be allocated for each multicast group
the interface is subscribed to, which in turn leaks one struct ifmcaddr6
per nontrivial multicast group the interface is subscribed to.

The following reproducer will leak at least $n objects:

ip addr add ff2e::4242/32 dev eth0 autojoin
sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.eth0.disable_ipv6=1
for i in $(seq 1 $n); do
	ip link set up eth0; ip link set down eth0
done

Joining groups with IPV6_ADD_MEMBERSHIP (unprivileged) or setting the
sysctl net.ipv6.conf.eth0.forwarding to 1 (=> subscribing to ff02::2)
can also be used to create a nontrivial idev->mc_list, which will the
leak objects with the right up-down-sequence.

Based on both sources for NETDEV_DOWN events the interface IPv6 state
should be considered:

 - not ready if the network interface is not ready OR IPv6 is disabled
   for it
 - ready if the network interface is ready AND IPv6 is enabled for it

The functions ipv6_mc_up() and ipv6_down() should only be run when this
state changes.

Implement this by remembering when the IPv6 state is ready, and only
run ipv6_mc_down() if it actually changed from ready to not ready.

The other direction (not ready -> ready) already works correctly, as:

 - the interface notification triggered codepath for NETDEV_UP /
   NETDEV_CHANGE returns early if ipv6 is disabled, and
 - the disable_ipv6=0 triggered codepath skips fully initializing the
   interface as long as addrconf_link_ready(dev) returns false
 - calling ipv6_mc_up() repeatedly does not leak anything"	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

won't remove those files. What's worse, the following UAF can be

xen/netfront: destroy queues before real_num_tx_queues is zeroed

xennet_destroy_queues() relies on info->netdev->real_num_tx_queues to
delete queues. Since d7dac083414eb5bb99a6d2ed53dc2c1b405224e5
(""net-sysfs: update the queue counts in the unregistration path""),
unregister_netdev() indirectly sets real_num_tx_queues to 0. Those two
facts together means, that xennet_destroy_queues() called from
xennet_remove() cannot do its job, because it's called after
unregister_netdev(). This results in kfree-ing queues that are still
linked in napi, which ultimately crashes:

Fix this by calling xennet_destroy_queues() from xennet_uninit(),
when real_num_tx_queues is still available. This ensures that queues are
destroyed when real_num_tx_queues is set to 0, regardless of how
unregister_netdev() was called.

This is because we started using writeback_inodes_sb() to flush delalloc
when committing a transaction (when using -o flushoncommit), in order to
avoid deadlocks with filesystem freeze operations. This change was made
by commit ce8ea7cc6eb313 (""btrfs: don't call btrfs_start_delalloc_roots
in flushoncommit""). After that change we started producing that warning,
and every now and then a user reports this since the warning happens too
often, it spams dmesg/syslog, and a user is unsure if this reflects any
problem that might compromise the filesystem's reliability.

We can not just lock the sb->s_umount semaphore before calling
writeback_inodes_sb(), because that would at least deadlock with
filesystem freezing, since at fs/super.c:freeze_super() sync_filesystem()
is called while we are holding that semaphore in write mode, and that can
trigger a transaction commit, resulting in a deadlock. It would also
trigger the same type of deadlock in the unmount path. Possibly, it could
also introduce some other locking dependencies that lockdep would report.

To fix this call try_to_writeback_inodes_sb() instead of
writeback_inodes_sb(), because that will try to read lock sb->s_umount
and then will only call writeback_inodes_sb() if it was able to lock it.
This is fine because the cases where it can't read lock sb->s_umount
are during a filesystem unmount or during a filesystem freeze - in those
cases sb->s_umount is write locked and sync_filesystem() is called, which
calls writeback_inodes_sb(). In other words, in all cases where we can't
take a read lock on sb->s_umount, writeback is already being triggered
elsewhere.

An alternative would be to call btrfs_start_delalloc_roots() with a
number of pages different from LONG_MAX, for example matching the number
of delalloc bytes we currently have, in

CVE-2022-48921	2024-08-22T02:15:08.197	2024-09-12T12:58:50.660	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched/fair: Fix fault in reweight_entity

Syzbot found a GPF in reweight_entity. This has been bisected to
commit 4ef0c5c6b5ba (""kernel/sched: Fix sched_fork() access an invalid
sched_task_group"")

There is a race between sched_post_fork() and setpriority(PRIO_PGRP)
within a thread group that causes a null-ptr-deref in
reweight_entity() in CFS. The scenario is that the main process spawns
number of new threads, which then call setpriority(PRIO_PGRP, 0, -20),
wait, and exit.  For each of the new threads the copy_process() gets
invoked, which adds the new task_struct and calls sched_post_fork()
for it.

In the above scenario there is a possibility that
setpriority(PRIO_PGRP) and set_one_prio() will be called for a thread
in the group that is just being created by copy_process(), and for
which the sched_post_fork() has not been executed yet. This will
trigger a null pointer dereference in reweight_entity(), as it will
try to access the run queue pointer, which hasn't been set.

Before the mentioned change the cfs_rq pointer for the task  has been
set in sched_fork(), which is called much earlier in copy_process(),
before the new task is added to the thread_group.  Now it is done in
the sched_post_fork(), which is called after that.  To fix the issue
the remove the update_load param from the update_load param() function
and call reweight_task() only if the task flag doesn't have the
TASK_NEW flag set."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

RDMA/cma: Do not change route.addr.src_addr outside state checks

If the state is not idle then resolve_prepare_src() should immediately
fail and no change to global state should happen. However, it
unconditionally overwrites the src_addr trying to build a temporary any
address.

For instance if the state is already RDMA_CM_LISTEN then this will corrupt
the src_addr and would cause the test in cma_cancel_operation():

           if (cma_any_addr(cma_src_addr(id_priv)) && !id_priv->cma_dev)

cma_cancel_listens().

Instead of trying to re-use the src_addr memory to indirectly create an
any address derived from the dst build one explicitly on the stack and
bind to that as any other normal flow would do. rdma_bind_addr() will copy
it over the src_addr once it knows the state is valid.

stateful objects can be updated from the control plane.

nft_obj_destroy does this, but it also decrements the module refcount,

ice: fix concurrent reset and removal of VFs

Commit c503e63200c6 (""ice: Stop processing VF messages during teardown"")
introduced a driver state flag, ICE_VF_DEINIT_IN_PROGRESS, which is
intended to prevent some issues with concurrently handling messages from
VFs while tearing down the VFs.

This change was motivated by crashes caused while tearing down and
bringing up VFs in rapid succession.

It turns out that the fix actually introduces issues with the VF driver
caused because the PF no longer responds to any messages sent by the VF
during its .remove routine. This results in the VF potentially removing
its DMA memory before the PF has shut down the device queues.

Additionally, the fix doesn't actually resolve concurrency issues within
the ice driver. It is possible for a VF to initiate a reset just prior
to the ice driver removing VFs. This can result in the remove task
concurrently operating while the VF is being reset. This results in
similar memory corruption and panics purportedly fixed by that commit.

Fix this concurrency at its root by protecting both the reset and
removal flows using the existing VF cfg_lock. This ensures that we
cannot remove the VF while any outstanding critical tasks such as a
virtchnl message or a reset are occurring.

This locking change also fixes the root cause originally fixed by commit
c503e63200c6 (""ice: Stop processing VF messages during teardown""), so we
can simply revert it.

Note that I kept these two changes together because simply reverting the
original commit alone would leave the driver vulnerable to worse race
conditions."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2022-48943	2024-08-22T04:15:19.027	2024-08-22T18:27:42.807	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86/mmu: make apf token non-zero to fix bug

In current async pagefault logic, when a page is ready, KVM relies on
kvm_arch_can_dequeue_async_page_present() to determine whether to deliver
a READY event to the Guest. This function test token value of struct
kvm_vcpu_pv_apf_data, which must be reset to zero by Guest kernel when a
READY event is finished by Guest. If value is zero meaning that a READY
event is done, so the KVM can deliver another.
But the kvm_arch_setup_async_pf() may produce a valid token with zero
value, which is confused with previous mention and may lead the loss of
this READY event.

This bug may cause task blocked forever in Guest:

CVE-2024-43790	2024-08-22T22:15:05.317	2025-08-18T17:08:16.193	Vim is an open source command line text editor. When performing a search and displaying the search-count message is disabled (:set shm+=S), the search pattern is displayed at the bottom of the screen in a buffer (msgbuf). When right-left mode (:set rl) is enabled, the search pattern is reversed. This happens by allocating a new buffer. If the search pattern contains some ASCII NUL characters, the buffer allocated will be smaller than the original allocated buffer (because for allocating the reversed buffer, the strlen() function is called, which only counts until it notices an ASCII NUL byte ) and thus the original length indicator is wrong. This causes an overflow when accessing characters inside the msgbuf by the previously (now wrong) length of the msgbuf.

The default setup of homepage 0.9.1 is vulnerable to DNS rebinding. Homepage is setup without certificate and authentication by default, leaving it to vulnerable to DNS rebinding. In this attack, an attacker will ask a user to visit his/her website. The attacker website will then change the DNS records of their domain from their IP address to the internal IP address of the homepage instance. To tell which IP addresses are valid, we can rebind a subdomain to each IP address we want to check, and see if there is a response. Once potential candidates have been found, the attacker can launch the attack by reading the response of the webserver after the IP address has changed. When the attacker domain is fetched, the response will be from the homepage instance, not the attacker website, because the IP address has been changed. Due to a lack of authentication, a user’s private information such as API keys (fixed after first report) and other private information can then be extracted by the attacker website.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

net/tcp: Disable TCP-AO static key after RCU grace period

The lifetime of TCP-AO static_key is the same as the last
tcp_ao_info. On the socket destruction tcp_ao_info ceases to be
with RCU grace period, while tcp-ao static branch is currently deferred
destructed. The static key definition is
: DEFINE_STATIC_KEY_DEFERRED_FALSE(tcp_ao_needed, HZ);

which means that if RCU grace period is delayed by more than a second
and tcp_ao_needed is in the process of disablement, other CPUs may
yet see tcp_ao_info which atent dead, but soon-to-be.
And that breaks the assumption of static_key_fast_inc_not_disabled().

See the comment near the definition:
> * The caller must make sure that the static key can't get disabled while
> * in this function. It doesn't patch jump labels, only adds a user to
> * an already enabled static key.

Originally it was introduced in commit eb8c507296f6 (""jump_label:
Prevent key->enabled int overflow""), which is needed for the atomic
contexts, one of which would be the creation of a full socket from a
request socket. In that atomic context, it's known by the presence
of the key (md5/ao) that the static branch is already enabled.
So, the ref counter for that static branch is just incremented
instead of holding the proper mutex.
static_key_fast_inc_not_disabled() is just a helper for such usage
case. But it must not be used if the static branch could get disabled
in parallel as it's not protected by jump_label_mutex and as a result,
races with jump_label_update() implementation details.

Happened on netdev test-bot[1], so not a theoretical issue:

tracing: Have format file honor EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED

When eventfs was introduced, special care had to be done to coordinate the
freeing of the file meta data with the files that are exposed to user
space. The file meta data would have a ref count that is set when the file
is created and would be decremented and freed after the last user that
opened the file closed it. When the file meta data was to be freed, it
would set a flag (EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED) to denote that the file is freed,
and any new references made (like new opens or reads) would fail as it is
marked freed. This allowed other meta data to be freed after this flag was
set (under the event_mutex).

All the files that were dynamically created in the events directory had a
pointer to the file meta data and would call event_release() when the last
reference to the user space file was closed. This would be the time that it
is safe to free the file meta data.

A shortcut was made for the ""format"" file. It's i_private would point to
the ""call"" entry directly and not point to the file's meta data. This is
because all format files are the same for the same ""call"", so it was
thought there was no reason to differentiate them.  The other files
maintain state (like the ""enable"", ""trigger"", etc). But this meant if the
file were to disappear, the ""format"" file would be unaware of it.

This caused a race that could be trigger via the user_events test (that
would create dynamic events and free them), and running a loop that would
read the user_events format files:

In one console run:

 # cd tools/testing/selftests/user_events
 # while true; do ./ftrace_test; done

And in another console run:

 # cd /sys/kernel/tracing/
 # while true; do cat events/user_events/__test_event/format; done 2>/dev/null

With KASAN memory checking, it would trigger a use-after-free bug report
(which was a real bug). This was because the format file was not checking
the file's meta data flag ""EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED"", so it would access the
event that the file meta data pointed to after the event was freed.

After inspection, there are other locations that were found to not check
the EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED flag when accessing the trace_event_file. Add a
new helper function: event_file_file() that will make sure that the
event_mutex is held, and will return NULL if the trace_event_file has the
EVENT_FILE_FL_FREED flag set. Have the first reference of the struct file
pointer use event_file_file() and check for NULL. Later uses can still use
the event_file_data() helper function if the event_mutex is still held and
was not released since the event_file_file() call."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

many small jobs"") decoupled the memcg IDs from the CSS ID space to fix the
cgroup creation failures.  It introduced IDR to maintain the memcg ID
space.  The IDR depends on external synchronization mechanisms for
modifications.  For the mem_cgroup_idr, the idr_alloc() and idr_replace()
happen within css callback and thus are protected through cgroup_mutex
from concurrent modifications.  However idr_remove() for mem_cgroup_idr
was not protected against concurrency and can be run concurrently for
different memcgs when they hit their refcnt to zero.  Fix that.

We have been seeing list_lru based kernel crashes at a low frequency in
our fleet for a long time.  These crashes were in different part of
list_lru code including list_lru_add(), list_lru_del() and reparenting
code.  Upon further inspection, it looked like for a given object (dentry
and inode), the super_block's list_lru didn't have list_lru_one for the
memcg of that object.  The initial suspicions were either the object is
not allocated through kmem_cache_alloc_lru() or somehow
memcg_list_lru_alloc() failed to allocate list_lru_one() for a memcg but
returned success.  No evidence were found for these cases.

Looking more deeply, we started seeing situations where valid memcg's id
is not present in mem_cgroup_idr and in some cases multiple valid memcgs
have same id and mem_cgroup_idr is pointing to one of them.  So, the most
reasonable explanation is that these situations can happen due to race
between multiple idr_remove() calls or race between
idr_alloc()/idr_replace() and idr_remove().  These races are causing
multiple memcgs to acquire the same ID and then offlining of one of them
would cleanup list_lrus on the system for all of them.  Later access from
other memcgs to the list_lru cause crashes due to missing list_lru_one."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

uartclk being zero in uart_set_info() needs to be done
before other settings are made as subsequent calls to

Mitigate with stricter input validation.

csum_offset: for GSO packets, deduce the correct value from gso_type.
This is already done for USO. Extend it to TSO. Let UFO be:
udp[46]_ufo_fragment ignores these fields and always computes the
checksum in software.

csum_start: finding the real offset requires parsing to the transport
header. Do not add a parser, use existing segmentation parsing. Thanks
to SKB_GSO_DODGY, that also catches bad packets that are hw offloaded.
Again test both TSO and USO. Do not test UFO for the above reason, and
do not test UDP tunnel offload.

GSO packet are almost always CHECKSUM_PARTIAL. USO packets may be
CHECKSUM_NONE since commit 10154dbded6d6 (""udp: Allow GSO transmit
from devices with no checksum offload""), but then still these fields
are initialized correctly in udp4_hwcsum/udp6_hwcsum_outgoing. So no
need to test for ip_summed == CHECKSUM_PARTIAL first.

This revises an existing fix mentioned in the Fixes tag, which broke
small packets with GSO offload, as detected by kselftests."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

media: xc2028: avoid use-after-free in load_firmware_cb()

syzkaller reported use-after-free in load_firmware_cb() [1].
The reason is because the module allocated a struct tuner in tuner_probe(),
and then the module initialization failed, the struct tuner was released.
A worker which created during module initialization accesses this struct
tuner later, it caused use-after-free.

The process is as follows:

task-6504           worker_thread
tuner_probe                             <= alloc dvb_frontend [2]

...
                    request_firmware_work_func  <= the firmware is ready
                    load_firmware_cb    <= but now the dvb_frontend has been freed

To fix the issue, check the dvd_frontend in load_firmware_cb(), if it is
null, report a warning and just return.

information from DCN401 which is not initialized in the dcn401_dpp_funcs

drm/amd/display: Add null checks for 'stream' and 'plane' before dereferencing

This commit adds null checks for the 'stream' and 'plane' variables in
the dcn30_apply_idle_power_optimizations function. These variables were
previously assumed to be null at line 922, but they were used later in
the code without checking if they were null. This could potentially lead
to a null pointer dereference, which would cause a crash.

The null checks ensure that 'stream' and 'plane' are not null before
they are used, preventing potential crashes.

Fixes the below static smatch checker:

bpf: add missing check_func_arg_reg_off() to prevent out-of-bounds memory accesses

Currently, it's possible to pass in a modified CONST_PTR_TO_DYNPTR to
a global function as an argument. The adverse effects of this is that
BPF helpers can continue to make use of this modified
CONST_PTR_TO_DYNPTR from within the context of the global function,
which can unintentionally result in out-of-bounds memory accesses and
therefore compromise overall system stability i.e.

Fix this panic the easy way first, by converting the BUG_ON() to
WARN_ON(), and stop the reshape if checkings fail.

bnxt_en : Fix memory out-of-bounds in bnxt_fill_hw_rss_tbl()

A recent commit has modified the code in __bnxt_reserve_rings() to
set the default RSS indirection table to default only when the number
of RX rings is changing.  While this works for newer firmware that
requires RX ring reservations, it causes the regression on older
firmware not requiring RX ring resrvations (BNXT_NEW_RM() returns
false).

With older firmware, RX ring reservations are not required and so
hw_resc->resv_rx_rings is not always set to the proper value.  The
comparison:

if (old_rx_rings != bp->hw_resc.resv_rx_rings)

in __bnxt_reserve_rings() may be false even when the RX rings are
changing.  This will cause __bnxt_reserve_rings() to skip setting
the default RSS indirection table to default to match the current
number of RX rings.  This may later cause bnxt_fill_hw_rss_tbl() to
use an out-of-range index.

We already have bnxt_check_rss_tbl_no_rmgr() to handle exactly this
scenario.  We just need to move it up in bnxt_need_reserve_rings()
to be called unconditionally when using older firmware.  Without the
fix, if the TX rings are changing, we'll skip the
bnxt_check_rss_tbl_no_rmgr() call and __bnxt_reserve_rings() may also
skip the bnxt_set_dflt_rss_indir_tbl() call for the reason explained
in the last paragraph.  Without setting the default RSS indirection
table to default, it causes the regression:

sctp: Fix null-ptr-deref in reuseport_add_sock().

syzbot reported a null-ptr-deref while accessing sk2->sk_reuseport_cb in
reuseport_add_sock(). [0]

The repro first creates a listener with SO_REUSEPORT.  Then, it creates
another listener on the same port and concurrently closes the first
listener.

The second listen() calls reuseport_add_sock() with the first listener as
sk2, where sk2->sk_reuseport_cb is not expected to be cleared concurrently,
but the close() does clear it by reuseport_detach_sock().

The problem is SCTP does not properly synchronise reuseport_alloc(),
reuseport_add_sock(), and reuseport_detach_sock().

The caller of reuseport_alloc() and reuseport_{add,detach}_sock() must
provide synchronisation for sockets that are classified into the same
reuseport group.

Otherwise, such sockets form multiple identical reuseport groups, and
all groups except one would be silently dead.

  1. Two sockets call listen() concurrently
  2. No socket in the same group found in sctp_ep_hashtable[]
  3. Two sockets call reuseport_alloc() and form two reuseport groups
  4. Only one group hit first in __sctp_rcv_lookup_endpoint() receives
      incoming packets

Also, the reported null-ptr-deref could occur.

TCP/UDP guarantees that would not happen by holding the hash bucket lock.

Let's apply the locking strategy to __sctp_hash_endpoint() and
__sctp_unhash_endpoint().

previously true judgment ""p->header.flag & BT-LEAF"" to change to no after writing
the name operation, this leads to entering an incorrect branch and accessing the

CVE-2024-43802	2024-08-26T19:15:07.943	2024-11-21T09:35:53.910	Vim is an improved version of the unix vi text editor. When flushing the typeahead buffer, Vim moves the current position in the typeahead buffer but does not check whether there is enough space left in the buffer to handle the next characters.  So this may lead to the tb_off position within the typebuf variable to point outside of the valid buffer size, which can then later lead to a heap-buffer overflow in e.g. ins_typebuf(). Therefore, when flushing the typeahead buffer, check if there is enough space left before advancing the off position. If not, fall back to flush current typebuf contents. It's not quite clear yet, what can lead to this situation. It seems to happen when error messages occur (which will cause Vim to flush the typeahead buffer) in comnination with several long mappgins and so it may eventually move the off position out of a valid buffer size. Impact is low since it is not easily reproducible and requires to have several mappings active and run into some error condition. But when this happens, this will cause a crash. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0697. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.	4.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L		
CVE-2024-43806	2024-08-26T19:15:08.190	2024-08-27T13:02:05.683	"Rustix is a set of safe Rust bindings to POSIX-ish APIs. When using `rustix::fs::Dir` using the `linux_raw` backend, it's possible for the iterator to ""get stuck"" when an IO error is encountered. Combined with a memory over-allocation issue in `rustix::fs::Dir::read_more`, this can cause quick and unbounded memory explosion (gigabytes in a few seconds if used on a hot path) and eventually lead to an OOM crash of the application. The symptoms were initially discovered in https://github.com/imsnif/bandwhich/issues/284. That post has lots of details of our investigation. Full details can be read on the GHSA-c827-hfw6-qwvm repo advisory. If a program tries to access a directory with its file descriptor after the file has been unlinked (or any other action that leaves the `Dir` iterator in the stuck state), and the implementation does not break after seeing an error, it can cause a memory explosion. As an example, Linux's various virtual file systems (e.g. `/proc`, `/sys`) can contain directories that spontaneously pop in and out of existence. Attempting to iterate over them using `rustix::fs::Dir` directly or indirectly (e.g. with the `procfs` crate) can trigger this fault condition if the implementation decides to continue on errors. An attacker knowledgeable about the implementation details of a vulnerable target can therefore try to trigger this fault condition via any one or a combination of several available APIs. If successful, the application host will quickly run out of memory, after which the application will likely be terminated by an OOM killer, leading to denial of service. This issue has been addressed in release versions 0.35.15, 0.36.16, 0.37.25, and 0.38.19. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-43798	2024-08-26T23:15:04.160	2024-08-27T13:01:37.913	Chisel is a fast TCP/UDP tunnel, transported over HTTP, secured via SSH. The Chisel server doesn't ever read the documented `AUTH` environment variable used to set credentials, which allows any unauthenticated user to connect, even if credentials were set. Anyone running the Chisel server that is using the `AUTH` environment variable to specify credentials to authenticate against is affected by this vulnerability. Chisel is often used to provide an entrypoint to a private network, which means services that are gated by Chisel may be affected. Additionally, Chisel is often used for exposing services to the internet. An attacker could MITM requests by connecting to a Chisel server and requesting to forward traffic from a remote port. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.10.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	8.6	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2024-45036	2024-08-26T23:15:04.637	2024-08-27T13:01:37.913	Tophat is a mobile applications testing harness. An Improper Access Control vulnerability can expose the `TOPHAT_APP_TOKEN` token stored in `~/.tophatrc` through use of a malicious Tophat URL controlled by the attacker. The vulnerability allows Tophat to send this token to the attacker's server without any checks to ensure that the server is trusted. This token can then be used to access internal build artifacts, for mobile applications, not intended to be public. The issue has been patched as of version 1.10.0.  The ability to request artifacts using a Tophat API has been deprecated as this flow was inherently insecure.  Systems that have implemented this kind of endpoint should cease use and invalidate the token immediately. There are no workarounds and all users should update as soon as possible.

CVE-2024-43788	2024-08-27T17:15:07.967	2024-09-03T15:15:15.937	Webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset. The webpack developers have discovered a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Webpack’s `AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule`. The DOM Clobbering gadget in the module can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an `img` tag with an unsanitized `name` attribute) are present. Real-world exploitation of this gadget has been observed in the Canvas LMS which allows a XSS attack to happen through a javascript code compiled by Webpack (the vulnerable part is from Webpack). DOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces of js code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into executable code.

CVE-2024-43414	2024-08-27T18:15:15.083	2024-09-12T21:33:40.887	"Apollo Federation is an architecture for declaratively composing APIs into a unified graph. Each team can own their slice of the graph independently, empowering them to deliver autonomously and incrementally. Instances of @apollo/query-planner >=2.0.0 and <2.8.5 are impacted by a denial-of-service vulnerability. @apollo/gateway versions >=2.0.0 and < 2.8.5 and Apollo Router <1.52.1 are also impacted through their use of @apollo/query-panner. If @apollo/query-planner is asked to plan a sufficiently complex query, it may loop infinitely and never complete. This results in unbounded memory consumption and either a crash or out-of-memory (OOM) termination. This issue can be triggered if you have at least one non-@key field that can be resolved by multiple subgraphs. To identify these shared fields, the schema for each subgraph must be reviewed. The mechanism to identify shared fields varies based on the version of Federation your subgraphs are using. You can check if your subgraphs are using Federation 1 or Federation 2 by reviewing their schemas. Federation 2 subgraph schemas will contain a @link directive referencing the version of Federation being used while Federation 1 subgraphs will not. For example, in a Federation 2 subgraph, you will find a line like @link(url: ""https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0""). If a similar @link directive is not present in your subgraph schema, it is using Federation 1. Note that a supergraph can contain a mix of Federation 1 and Federation 2 subgraphs. This issue results from the Apollo query planner attempting to use a Number exceeding Javascript’s Number.MAX_VALUE in some cases. In Javascript, Number.MAX_VALUE is (2^1024 - 2^971). When the query planner receives an inbound graphql request, it breaks the query into pieces and for each piece, generates a list of potential execution steps to solve the piece. These candidates represent the steps that the query planner will take to satisfy the pieces of the larger query. As part of normal operations, the query planner requires and calculates the number of possible query plans for the total query. That is, it needs the product of the number of query plan candidates for each piece of the query. Under normal circumstances, after generating all query plan candidates and calculating the number of all permutations, the query planner moves on to stack rank candidates and prune less-than-optimal options. In particularly complex queries, especially those where fields can be solved through multiple subgraphs, this can cause the number of all query plan permutations to balloon. In worst-case scenarios, this can end up being a number larger than Number.MAX_VALUE. In Javascript, if Number.MAX_VALUE is exceeded, Javascript represents the value as “infinity”. If the count of candidates is evaluated as infinity, the component of the query planner responsible for pruning less-than-optimal query plans does not actually prune candidates, causing the query planner to evaluate many orders of magnitude more query plan candidates than necessary. This issue has been addressed in @apollo/query-planner v2.8.5, @apollo/gateway v2.8.5, and Apollo Router v1.52.1. Users are advised to upgrade. This issue can be avoided by ensuring there are no fields resolvable from multiple subgraphs. If all subgraphs are using Federation 2, you can confirm that you are not impacted by ensuring that none of your subgraph schemas use the @shareable directive. If you are using Federation 1 subgraphs, you will need to validate that there are no fields resolvable by multiple subgraphs."	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2024-43783	2024-08-27T18:15:15.403	2024-09-12T21:33:56.637	The Apollo Router Core is a configurable, high-performance graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation 2. Instances of the Apollo Router running versions >=1.21.0 and < 1.52.1 are impacted by a denial of service vulnerability if _all_ of the following are true: 1. The Apollo Router has been configured to support [External Coprocessing](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/customizations/coprocessor). 2. The Apollo Router has been configured to send request bodies to coprocessors. This is a non-default configuration and must be configured intentionally by administrators. Instances of the Apollo Router running versions >=1.7.0 and <1.52.1 are impacted by a denial-of-service vulnerability if all of the following are true: 1. Router has been configured to use a custom-developed Native Rust Plugin. 2. The plugin accesses Request.router_request in the RouterService layer. 3. You are accumulating the body from Request.router_request into memory. If using an impacted configuration, the Router will load entire HTTP request bodies into memory without respect to other HTTP request size-limiting configurations like limits.http_max_request_bytes. This can cause the Router to be out-of-memory (OOM) terminated if a sufficiently large request is sent to the Router. By default, the Router sets limits.http_max_request_bytes to 2 MB. If you have an impacted configuration as defined above, please upgrade to at least Apollo Router 1.52.1. If you cannot upgrade, you can mitigate the denial-of-service opportunity impacting External Coprocessors by setting the coprocessor.router.request.body configuration option to false. Please note that changing this configuration option will change the information sent to any coprocessors you have configured and may impact functionality implemented by those coprocessors. If you have developed a Native Rust Plugin and cannot upgrade, you can update your plugin to either not accumulate the request body or enforce a maximum body size limit. You can also mitigate this issue by limiting HTTP body payload sizes prior to the Router (e.g., in a proxy or web application firewall appliance).	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Per the analysis done by yangge, when starting the SEV virtual machine, it
will call pin_user_pages_fast(..., FOLL_LONGTERM, ...) to pin the memory. 
But the page is in CMA area, so fast GUP will fail then fallback to the
slow path due to the longterm pinnalbe check in try_grab_folio().

The slow path will try to pin the pages then migrate them out of CMA area.
But the slow path also uses try_grab_folio() to pin the page, it will
also fail due to the same check then the above warning is triggered.

In addition, the try_grab_folio() is supposed to be used in fast path and
it elevates folio refcount by using add ref unless zero.  We are guaranteed
to have at least one stable reference in slow path, so the simple atomic add
could be used.  The performance difference should be trivial, but the
misuse may be confusing and misleading.

Redefined try_grab_folio() to try_grab_folio_fast(), and try_grab_page()
to try_grab_folio(), and use them in the proper paths.  This solves both
the abuse and the kernel warning.

The proper naming makes their usecase more clear and should prevent from
abusing in the future.

OpenTelemetry Collector can be configured to receive CloudWatch metrics via an AWS Firehose Stream. Firehose sets the header `X-Amz-Firehose-Access-Key` with an arbitrary configured string. The OpenTelemetry Collector awsfirehosereceiver can optionally be configured to require this key on incoming requests.

Users of that role can only perform permitted actions. Permissions for creating and deleting languages have already existed and could be configured, but were not enforced by Kirby's frontend or backend code. A permission for updating existing languages has not existed before the patched versions. So disabling the languages.* wildcard permission for a role could not have prohibited updates to existing language definitions. The missing permission checks allowed attackers with Panel access to manipulate the language definitions.

An OS Command Injection vulnerability allows any authenticated user on the application to execute arbitrary code on the web application server via port scanning functionality. User-supplied input is used without validation when constructing and executing an OS command. User supplied JSON POST data is parsed and if ""id"" JSON key does not exist, JSON value supplied via ""ip"" JSON key is assigned to the ""ip"" variable. Later on, ""ip"" variable which can be controlled by the attacker is used when constructing the cmd and cmd1 strings without any extra validation. Then, server_mod.subprocess_execute function is called on both cmd1 and cmd2. When the definition of the server_mod.subprocess_execute() function is analyzed, it can be seen that subprocess.Popen() is called on the input parameter with shell=True which results in OS Command Injection.

CVE-2024-45045	2024-08-29T17:15:08.977	2024-09-03T15:13:16.580	Collabora Online is a collaborative online office suite based on LibreOffice technology. In the mobile (Android/iOS) device variants of Collabora Online it was possible to inject JavaScript via url encoded values in links contained in documents. Since the Android JavaScript interface allows access to internal functions, the likelihood that the app could be compromised via this vulnerability is considered high. Non-mobile variants are not affected. Mobile variants should update to the latest version provided by the platform appstore. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	6.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L		
CVE-2024-45056	2024-08-29T17:15:09.173	2024-09-03T15:14:54.877	zksolc is a Solidity compiler for ZKsync. All LLVM versions since 2015 fold `(xor (shl 1, x), -1)` to `(rotl ~1, x)` if run with optimizations enabled. Here `~1` is generated as an unsigned 64 bits number (`2^64-1`). This number is zero-extended to 256 bits on EraVM target while it should have been sign-extended. Thus instead of producing `roti 2^256 - 1, x` the compiler produces `rotl 2^64 - 1, x`. Analysis has shown that no contracts were affected by the date of publishing this advisory. This issue has been addressed in version 1.5.3. Users are advised to upgrade and redeploy all contracts. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	5.9	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

CVE-2024-45302	2024-08-29T22:15:05.377	2024-10-01T20:05:07.857	RestSharp is a Simple REST and HTTP API Client for .NET. The second argument to `RestRequest.AddHeader` (the header value) is vulnerable to CRLF injection. The same applies to `RestRequest.AddOrUpdateHeader` and `RestClient.AddDefaultHeader`. The way HTTP headers are added to a request is via the `HttpHeaders.TryAddWithoutValidation` method which does not check for CRLF characters in the header value. This means that any headers from a `RestSharp.RequestHeaders` object are added to the request in such a way that they are vulnerable to CRLF-injection. In general, CRLF-injection into a HTTP header (when using HTTP/1.1) means that one can inject additional HTTP headers or smuggle whole HTTP requests. If an application using the RestSharp library passes a user-controllable value through to a header, then that application becomes vulnerable to CRLF-injection. This is not necessarily a security issue for a command line application like the one above, but if such code were present in a web application then it becomes vulnerable to request splitting (as shown in the PoC) and thus Server Side Request Forgery. Strictly speaking this is a potential vulnerability in applications using RestSharp, not in RestSharp itself, but I would argue that at the very least there needs to be a warning about this behaviour in the RestSharp documentation. RestSharp has addressed this issue in version 112.0.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	6.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H

Svelte improperly escapes HTML on server-side rendering. The assumption is that attributes will always stay as such, but in some situation the final DOM tree rendered on browsers is different from what Svelte expects on server-side rendering. This may be leveraged to perform XSS attacks, and a type of the XSS is known as mXSS (mutation XSS). More specifically, this can occur when injecting malicious content into an attribute within a `noscript` tag. This issue has been addressed in release version 4.2.19. Users are advised to upgrade.

CVE-2024-44946	2024-08-31T14:15:04.320	2024-09-04T12:15:05.150	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

kcm: Serialise kcm_sendmsg() for the same socket.

syzkaller reported UAF in kcm_release(). [0]

The scenario is

  1. Thread A builds a skb with MSG_MORE and sets kcm->seq_skb.

  2. Thread A resumes building skb from kcm->seq_skb but is blocked
     by sk_stream_wait_memory()

  3. Thread B calls sendmsg() concurrently, finishes building kcm->seq_skb
     and puts the skb to the write queue

  4. Thread A faces an error and finally frees skb that is already in the
     write queue

  5. kcm_release() does double-free the skb in the write queue

When a thread is building a MSG_MORE skb, another thread must not touch it.

Let's add a per-sk mutex and serialise kcm_sendmsg().
