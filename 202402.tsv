When Bref is used with the Event-Driven Function runtime and the handler is a `RequestHandlerInterface`, then the Lambda event is converted to a PSR7 object. During the conversion process, if the request is a MultiPart, each part is parsed and for each which contains a file, it is extracted and saved in `/tmp` with a random filename starting with `bref_upload_`. The flow mimics what plain PHP does but it does not delete the temporary files when the request has been processed. An attacker could fill the Lambda instance disk by performing multiple MultiPart requests containing files. This vulnerability is patched in 2.1.13.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2024-24753	2024-02-01T16:17:14.690	2024-11-21T08:59:37.730	Bref enable serverless PHP on AWS Lambda. When Bref is used in combination with an API Gateway with the v2 format, it does not handle multiple values headers. If PHP generates a response with two headers having the same key but different values only the latest one is kept. If an application relies on multiple headers with the same key being set for security reasons, then Bref would lower the application security. For example, if an application sets multiple `Content-Security-Policy` headers, then Bref would just reflect the latest one. This vulnerability is patched in 2.1.13.	4.8	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

When Bref is used with the Event-Driven Function runtime and the handler is a `RequestHandlerInterface`, then the Lambda event is converted to a PSR7 object. During the conversion process, if the request is a MultiPart, each part is parsed and its content added in the `$files` or `$parsedBody` arrays. The conversion process produces a different output compared to the one of plain PHP when keys ending with and open square bracket ([) are used. Based on the application logic the difference in the body parsing might lead to vulnerabilities and/or undefined behaviors.

CVE-2024-24557	2024-02-01T17:15:10.953	2024-11-21T08:59:24.603	Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software containerization. The classic builder cache system is prone to cache poisoning if the image is built FROM scratch. Also, changes to some instructions (most important being HEALTHCHECK and ONBUILD) would not cause a cache miss. An attacker with the knowledge of the Dockerfile someone is using could poison their cache by making them pull a specially crafted image that would be considered as a valid cache candidate for some build steps. 23.0+ users are only affected if they explicitly opted out of Buildkit (DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 environment variable) or are using the /build API endpoint. All users on versions older than 23.0 could be impacted. Image build API endpoint (/build) and ImageBuild function from github.com/docker/docker/client is also affected as it the uses classic builder by default. Patches are included in 24.0.9 and 25.0.2 releases.	6.9	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:L

CVE-2023-52138	2024-02-05T15:15:08.393	2025-02-13T18:15:54.117	Engrampa is an archive manager for the MATE environment. Engrampa is found to be vulnerable to a Path Traversal vulnerability that can be leveraged to achieve full Remote Command Execution (RCE) on the target. While handling CPIO archives, the Engrampa Archive manager follows symlink, cpio by default will follow stored symlinks while extracting and the Archiver will not check the symlink location, which leads to arbitrary file writes to unintended locations. When the victim extracts the archive, the attacker can craft a malicious cpio or ISO archive to achieve RCE on the target system. This vulnerability was fixed in commit 63d5dfa.	8.2	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N

Using well-crafted inputs to `git_revparse_single` can cause the function to enter an infinite loop, potentially causing a Denial of Service attack in the calling application. The revparse function in `src/libgit2/revparse.c` uses a loop to parse the user-provided spec string. There is an edge-case during parsing that allows a bad actor to force the loop conditions to access arbitrary memory. Potentially, this could also leak memory if the extracted rev spec is reflected back to the attacker. As such, libgit2 versions before 1.4.0 are not affected. Users should upgrade to version 1.6.5 or 1.7.2.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Three mitigating factors to help prevent exploitation include: the usual login page (at `/admin/login/`) does not fully log in the user until the second factor was succesfully provided; the additional non-MFA protected login page at `/api/v2/api-authlogin/` was misconfigured and could not be used to log in; and there are no additional ways to log in. This also requires credentials of a superuser to be compromised to be exploitable. Versions 2.2.9, 2.3.7, 2.4.5, and 2.5.2 contain the following patches to address these weaknesses: Move and only enable the API auth endpoints (`/api/v2/api-auth/login/`) with `settings.DEBUG = True`. `settings.DEBUG = True` is insecure and should never be applied in production settings. Additionally, apply a custom permission check to the hijack flow to only allow second-factor-verified superusers to perform user hijacking.	7.7	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N

Arrays can be keyed by a signed integer, while they are defined for unsigned integers only. The typechecker doesn't throw when spotting the usage of an `int` as an index for an array. The typechecker allows the usage of signed integers to be used as indexes to arrays. The vulnerability is present in different forms in all versions, including `0.3.10`. For ints, the 2's complement representation is used. Because the array was declared very large, the bounds checking will pass Negative values will simply be represented as very large numbers. As of time of publication, a fixed version does not exist.

There are three potential vulnerability classes: unpredictable behavior, accessing inaccessible elements and denial of service. Class 1: If it is possible to index an array with a negative integer without reverting, this is most likely not anticipated by the developer and such accesses can cause unpredictable behavior for the contract. Class 2: If a contract has an invariant in the form `assert index < x`, the developer will suppose that no elements on indexes `y | y >= x` are accessible. However, by using negative indexes, this can be bypassed. Class 3: If the index is dependent on the state of the contract, this poses a risk of denial of service. If the state of the contract can be manipulated in such way that the index will be forced to be negative, the array access can always revert (because most likely the array won't be declared extremely large). However, all these the scenarios are highly unlikely. Most likely behavior is a revert on the bounds check."	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Starting in version 4.3.0 and prior to versions 5.1.11 and 5.2.4, reauthenticating with an existing session cookie would re-use that session id, even if for different user credentials. In this case, the pre-existing session could be used to gain elevated access to an existing Graylog login session, provided the malicious user could successfully inject their session cookie into someone else's browser. The complexity of such an attack is high, because it requires presenting a spoofed login screen and injection of a session cookie into an existing browser, potentially through a cross-site scripting attack. No such attack has been discovered. Graylog 5.1.11 and 5.2.4, and any versions of the 6.0 development branch, contain patches to not re-use sessions under any circumstances. Some workarounds are available. Using short session expiration and explicit log outs of unused sessions can help limiting the attack vector. Unpatched this vulnerability exists, but is relatively hard to exploit.

If a user with the appropriate permissions performs the request, arbitrary classes with 1-arg String constructors can be instantiated. This will execute arbitrary code that is run during class instantiation. In the specific use case of `java.io.File`, the behavior of the internal web-server stack will lead to information exposure by including the entire file content in the response to the REST request.

CVE-2024-24806	2024-02-07T22:15:10.173	2024-11-21T08:59:45.137	libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O. The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to 256 characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to create addresses like `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. The vulnerability arises due to how the `hostname_ascii` variable (with a length of 256 bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and subsequently in `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites (similar to MySpace) that allows users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.48.0.

Vulnerability Cause Description：

The http_parser does not comply with the RFC-7230 HTTP 1.1 specification.

Attack scenario:
If a message is received with both a Transfer-Encoding and a Content-Length header field, such a message might indicate an attempt to perform request smuggling or response splitting.
One particular attack scenario is that a bRPC made http server on the backend receiving requests in one persistent connection from frontend server that uses TE to parse request with the logic that 'chunk' is contained in the TE field. in that case an attacker can smuggle a request into the connection to the backend server. 

Solution:
You can choose one solution from below:
1. Upgrade bRPC to version 1.8.0, which fixes this issue. Download link:  https://github.com/apache/brpc/releases/tag/1.8.0
 2. Apply this patch:  https://github.com/apache/brpc/pull/2518"	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

A regular user can manipulate the payload to assign root-level privileges. This vulnerability leads to Unauthorized Privilege Escalation and significantly compromises the application's role-based access control system. It allows unauthorized control over application resources and poses a risk to data security. All users, particularly those in administrative roles, are impacted.

A critical vulnerability has been identified in the ""/api/{org_id}/users/{email_id}"" endpoint. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user within an organization to remove any other user from that same organization, irrespective of their respective roles. This includes the ability to remove users with ""Admin"" and ""Root"" roles. By enabling any organizational member to unilaterally alter the user base, it opens the door to unauthorized access and can cause considerable disruptions in operations. The core of the vulnerability lies in the `remove_user_from_org` function in the user management system. This function is designed to allow organizational users to remove members from their organization. The function does not check if the user initiating the request has the appropriate administrative privileges to remove a user. Any user who is part of the organization, irrespective of their role, can remove any other user, including those with higher privileges. This vulnerability is categorized as an Authorization issue leading to Unauthorized User Removal. The impact is severe, as it compromises the integrity of user management within organizations. By exploiting this vulnerability, any user within an organization, without the need for administrative privileges, can remove critical users, including ""Admins"" and ""Root"" users. This could result in unauthorized system access, administrative lockout, or operational disruptions. Given that user accounts are typically created by ""Admins"" or ""Root"" users, this vulnerability can be exploited by any user who has been granted access to an organization, thereby posing a critical risk to the security and operational stability of the application. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.8.0. Users are advised to upgrade."	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L

Enabled but unsecured management endpoints are susceptible to drive-by localhost attacks. While not typical of a production application, these attacks may have more impact on a development environment where such endpoints may be flipped on without much thought. A malicious/compromised website can make HTTP requests to `localhost`. Normally, such requests would trigger a CORS preflight check which would prevent the request; however, some requests are ""simple"" and do not require a preflight check. These endpoints, if enabled and not secured, are vulnerable to being triggered. Production environments typically disable unused endpoints and secure/restrict access to needed endpoints. A more likely victim is the developer in their local development host, who has enabled endpoints without security for the sake of easing development. This issue has been addressed in version 3.8.3. Users are advised to upgrade."	5.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L		
CVE-2024-24819	2024-02-09T01:15:10.080	2024-11-21T08:59:46.900	icingaweb2-module-incubator is a working project of bleeding edge Icinga Web 2 libraries. In affected versions the class `gipfl\Web\Form` is the base for various concrete form implementations [1] and provides protection against cross site request forgery (CSRF) by default. This is done by automatically adding an element with a CSRF token to any form, unless explicitly disabled, but even if enabled, the CSRF token (sent during a client's submission of a form relying on it) is not validated. This enables attackers to perform changes on behalf of a user which, unknowingly, interacts with a prepared link or website. The version 0.22.0 is available to remedy this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L

This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0.
One of the two endpoints that publishes the Solr process' Java system properties, /admin/info/properties, was only setup to hide system properties that had ""password"" contained in the name.
There are a number of sensitive system properties, such as ""basicauth"" and ""aws.secretKey"" do not contain ""password"", thus their values were published via the ""/admin/info/properties"" endpoint.
This endpoint populates the list of System Properties on the home screen of the Solr Admin page, making the exposed credentials visible in the UI.

This /admin/info/properties endpoint is protected under the ""config-read"" permission.
Therefore, Solr Clouds with Authorization enabled will only be vulnerable through logged-in users that have the ""config-read"" permission.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0 or 8.11.3, which fixes the issue.
A single option now controls hiding Java system property for all endpoints, ""-Dsolr.hiddenSysProps"".
By default all known sensitive properties are hidden (including ""-Dbasicauth""), as well as any property with a name containing ""secret"" or ""password"".

Users who cannot upgrade can also use the following Java system property to fix the issue:

In the affected versions, Solr ConfigSets accepted Java jar and class files to be uploaded through the ConfigSets API.

Any native code packages built by `pkg` are written to a hardcoded directory. On unix systems, this is `/tmp/pkg/*` which is a shared directory for all users on the same local system. There is no uniqueness to the package names within this directory, they are predictable. An attacker who has access to the same local system has the ability to replace the genuine executables in the shared directory with malicious executables of the same name. A user may then run the malicious executable without realising it has been modified. This package is deprecated. Therefore, there will not be a patch provided for this vulnerability. To check if your executable build by pkg depends on native code and is vulnerable, run the executable and check if `/tmp/pkg/` was created. Users should transition to actively maintained alternatives. We would recommend investigating Node.js 21’s support for single executable applications. Given the decision to deprecate the pkg package, there are no official workarounds or remediations provided by our team.

In affected versions missing input validation on mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie value makes the server vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. An internal security audit has been conducted and the reviewers found that if they manipulated the value of the mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie to a very large integer, like 99999999, the server struggles with the request for a long time and finally gets back with a 500 error. Making a few requests of this kind caused our server to become unresponsive. Attackers can craft requests that would make the server work very hard (and possibly become unresponsive) and/or crash with minimal effort. This issue has been addressed in version 2.4.15.2.

If this plugin was configured to send requests to a bare host with no path (e.g.  https://www.example.com/ https://www.example.com/` ), requests to an endpoint other than the one configured by the administrator could be triggered by a specially crafted request from any user, resulting in an SSRF vector.

Due to inadequate sanitization of the dashboard-supplied path parameter, it was possible to include path traversal characters (../) in the path parameter and send requests to paths on the configured endpoint outside the configured sub-path. 





    
    
            






    
    
            This means that if the datasource was configured by an administrator to point at some sub-path of a domain (e.g.  https://example.com/api/some_safe_api/ ), it was possible for an editor to create a dashboard referencing the datasource which issues queries containing path traversal characters, which would in turn cause the datasource to instead query arbitrary subpaths on the configured domain (e.g.  https://example.com/api/admin_api/) .

In the rare case that this plugin is configured by an administrator to point back at the Grafana instance itself, this vulnerability becomes considerably more severe, as an administrator browsing a maliciously configured panel could be compelled to make requests to Grafana administrative API endpoints with their credentials, resulting in the potential for privilege escalation, hence the high score for this vulnerability."	8.0	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Due to a Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value bug ,Squid may be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against HTTP header parsing. This problem allows a remote client or a remote server to perform Denial of Service when sending oversized headers in HTTP messages. In versions of Squid prior to 6.5 this can be achieved if the request_header_max_size or reply_header_max_size settings are unchanged from the default. In Squid version 6.5 and later, the default setting of these parameters is safe. Squid will emit a critical warning in cache.log if the administrator is setting these parameters to unsafe values. Squid will not at this time prevent these settings from being changed to unsafe values. Users are advised to upgrade to version 6.5. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

CVE-2024-25618	2024-02-14T21:15:08.410	2024-12-18T22:27:39.050	Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. Mastodon allows new identities from configured authentication providers (CAS, SAML, OIDC) to attach to existing local users with the same e-mail address. This results in a possible account takeover if the authentication provider allows changing the e-mail address or multiple authentication providers are configured. When a user logs in through an external authentication provider for the first time, Mastodon checks the e-mail address passed by the provider to find an existing account. However, using the e-mail address alone means that if the authentication provider allows changing the e-mail address of an account, the Mastodon account can immediately be hijacked. All users logging in through external authentication providers are affected. The severity is medium, as it also requires the external authentication provider to misbehave. However, some well-known OIDC providers (like Microsoft Azure) make it very easy to accidentally allow unverified e-mail changes. Moreover, OpenID Connect also allows dynamic client registration. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.2.6, 4.1.14, 4.0.14, and 3.5.18. Users are advised to upgrade.

When an OAuth Application is destroyed, the streaming server wasn't being informed that the Access Tokens had also been destroyed, this could have posed security risks to users by allowing an application to continue listening to streaming after the application had been destroyed. Essentially this comes down to the fact that when Doorkeeper sets up the relationship between Applications and Access Tokens, it uses a `dependent: delete_all` configuration, which means the `after_commit` callback setup on `AccessTokenExtension` didn't actually fire, since `delete_all` doesn't trigger ActiveRecord callbacks. To mitigate, we need to add a `before_destroy` callback to `ApplicationExtension` which announces to streaming that all the Application's Access Tokens are being ""killed"". Impact should be negligible given the affected application had to be owned by the user. None the less this issue has been addressed in versions 4.2.6, 4.1.14, 4.0.14, and 3.5.18.

In (D)TLS 1.3 the handshake is encrypted after the ServerHello but a wolfSSL client would accept an unencrypted flight from the server.

CVE-2024-25123	2024-02-15T22:15:48.060	2025-01-09T14:30:38.743	MSS (Mission Support System) is an open source package designed for planning atmospheric research flights. In file: `index.py`, there is a method that is vulnerable to path manipulation attack. By modifying file paths, an attacker can acquire sensitive information from different resources. The `filename` variable is joined with other variables to form a file path in `_file`. However, `filename` is a route parameter that can capture path type values i.e. values including slashes (\). So it is possible for an attacker to manipulate the file being read by assigning a value containing ../ to `filename` and so the attacker may be able to gain access to other files on the host filesystem. This issue has been addressed in MSS version 8.3.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	7.3	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

Prior to versions 4.2.7, 4.1.15, 4.0.15, and 3.5.19, when fetching remote statuses, Mastodon doesn't check that the response from the remote server has a `Content-Type` header value of the Activity Streams media type, which allows a threat actor to upload a crafted Activity Streams document to a remote server and make a Mastodon server fetch it, if the remote server accepts arbitrary user uploads. The vulnerability allows a threat actor to impersonate an account on a remote server that satisfies all of the following properties: allows the attacker to register an account; accepts arbitrary user-uploaded documents and places them on the same domain as the ActivityPub actors; and serves user-uploaded document in response to requests with an `Accept` header value of the Activity Streams media type.

CVE-2024-25625	2024-02-19T16:15:52.060	2025-04-01T15:38:06.277	Pimcore's Admin Classic Bundle provides a Backend UI for Pimcore. A potential security vulnerability has been discovered in `pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle` prior to version 1.3.4. The vulnerability involves a Host Header Injection in the `invitationLinkAction` function of the UserController, specifically in the way `$loginUrl` trusts user input.  The host header from incoming HTTP requests is used unsafely when generating URLs. An attacker can manipulate the HTTP host header in requests to the /admin/user/invitationlink endpoint, resulting in the generation of URLs with the attacker's domain. In fact, if a host header is injected in the POST request, the $loginURL parameter is constructed with this unvalidated host header. It is then used to send an invitation email to the provided user. This vulnerability can be used to perform phishing attacks by making the URLs in the invitation links emails point to an attacker-controlled domain. Version 1.3.4 contains a patch for the vulnerability. The maintainers recommend validating the host header and ensuring it matches the application's domain. It would also be beneficial to use a default trusted host or hostname if the incoming host header is not recognized or is absent.	8.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N

Even with the application of SROS2, due to the issue where the data (`p[UD]`) and `guid` values used to disconnect between nodes are not encrypted, a vulnerability has been discovered where a malicious attacker can forcibly disconnect a Subscriber and can deny a Subscriber attempting to connect. Afterwards, if the attacker sends the packet for disconnecting, which is data (`p[UD]`), to the Global Data Space (`239.255.0.1:7400`) using the said Publisher ID, all the Subscribers (Listeners) connected to the Publisher (Talker) will not receive any data and their connection will be disconnected. Moreover, if this disconnection packet is sent continuously, the Subscribers (Listeners) trying to connect will not be able to do so.

This connection is unaware of the outermost layer when closing the connection during the connection opening procedure. Hence, the Undertow WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit is not notified of the closed connection in this scenario. Because WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit creates a timeout task, the whole dependency tree leaks via that task, which is added to XNIO WorkerThread. So, the workerThread points to the Undertow conduit, which contains the connections and causes the leak."	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Starting in version 0.23.0 and prior to versions 0.27.5 and 0.28.0, the CSRF authenticity token check is disabled for the questionnaire templates preview. The issue does not imply a serious security thread as you need to have access also to the session cookie in order to see this resource. This URL does not allow modifying the resource but it may allow attackers to gain access to information which was not meant to be public. The issue is fixed in version 0.27.5 and 0.28.0. As a workaround, disable the templates functionality or remove all available templates.	4.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2023-48220	2024-02-20T18:15:50.350	2024-12-16T21:46:47.680	Decidim is a participatory democracy framework. Starting in version 0.4.rc3 and prior to version 2.0.9 of the `devise_invitable` gem, the invites feature allows users to accept the invitation for an unlimited amount of time through the password reset functionality. This issue creates vulnerable dependencies starting in version 0.0.1.alpha3 and prior to versions 0.26.9, 0.27.5, and 0.28.0 of the `decidim,` `decidim-admin`, and `decidim-system` gems. When using the password reset functionality, the `devise_invitable` gem always accepts the pending invitation if the user has been invited. The only check done is if the user has been invited but the code does not ensure that the pending invitation is still valid as defined by the `invite_for` expiry period. Decidim sets this configuration to `2.weeks` so this configuration should be respected. The bug is in the `devise_invitable` gem and should be fixed there and the dependency should be upgraded in Decidim once the fix becomes available. `devise_invitable` to version `2.0.9` and above fix this issue. Versions 0.26.9, 0.27.5, and 0.28.0 of the `decidim,` `decidim-admin`, and `decidim-system` gems contain this fix. As a workaround, invitations can be cancelled directly from the database.	5.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2023-51447	2024-02-20T18:15:50.547	2024-12-16T22:43:27.217	Decidim is a participatory democracy framework. Starting in version 0.27.0 and prior to versions 0.27.5 and 0.28.0, the dynamic file upload feature is subject to potential cross-site scripting attacks in case the attacker manages to modify the file names of the records being uploaded to the server. This appears in sections where the user controls the file upload dialogs themselves and has the technical knowledge to change the file names through the dynamic upload endpoint. Therefore I believe it would require the attacker to control the whole session of the particular user but in any case, this needs to be fixed. Successful exploit of this vulnerability would require the user to have successfully uploaded a file blob to the server with a malicious file name and then have the possibility to direct the other user to the edit page of the record where the attachment is attached. The users are able to craft the direct upload requests themselves controlling the file name that gets stored to the database. The attacker is able to change the filename e.g. to `<svg onload=alert('XSS')>` if they know how to craft these requests themselves. And then enter the returned blob ID to the form inputs manually by modifying the edit page source. Versions 0.27.5 and 0.28.0 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, disable dynamic uploads for the instance, e.g. from proposals.	6.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N

computation in skb_segment() can reach it quite easily :

CVE-2024-26135	2024-02-20T20:15:08.560	2025-01-16T19:24:58.253	MeshCentral is a full computer management web site. Versions prior to 1.1.21 a cross-site websocket hijacking (CSWSH) vulnerability within the control.ashx endpoint. This component is the primary mechanism used within MeshCentral to perform administrative actions on the server. The vulnerability is exploitable when an attacker is able to convince a victim end-user to click on a malicious link to a page hosting an attacker-controlled site. The attacker can then originate a cross-site websocket connection using client-side JavaScript code to connect to `control.ashx` as the victim user within MeshCentral. Version 1.1.21 contains a patch for this issue.	8.3	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

binder: fix use-after-free in shinker's callback

The mmap read lock is used during the shrinker's callback, which means
that using alloc->vma pointer isn't safe as it can race with munmap().
As of commit dd2283f2605e (""mm: mmap: zap pages with read mmap_sem in
munmap"") the mmap lock is downgraded after the vma has been isolated.

I was able to reproduce this issue by manually adding some delays and
triggering page reclaiming through the shrinker's debug sysfs. The
following KASAN report confirms the UAF:

Fix this issue by performing instead a vma_lookup() which will fail to
find the vma that was isolated before the mmap lock downgrade. Note that
this option has better performance than upgrading to a mmap write lock
which would increase contention. Plus, mmap_write_trylock() has been
recently removed anyway."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2024-1631	2024-02-21T03:15:08.747	2024-11-21T08:50:57.763	"Impact: The library offers a function to generate an ed25519 key pair via Ed25519KeyIdentity.generate with an optional param to provide a 32 byte seed value, which will then be used as the secret key. When no seed value is provided, it is expected that the library generates the secret key using secure randomness. However, a recent change broke this guarantee and uses an insecure seed for key pair generation. Since the private key of this identity (535yc-uxytb-gfk7h-tny7p-vjkoe-i4krp-3qmcl-uqfgr-cpgej-yqtjq-rqe) is compromised, one could lose funds associated with the principal on ledgers or lose access to a canister where this principal is the controller.

 -EBUSY instead of -EINPROGRESS in valid situations. For example, when
the cryptd queue for AESNI is full (easy to trigger with an
artificially low cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen), requests will be enqueued
to the backlog but still processed. In that case, the async callback
will also be called twice: first with err == -EINPROGRESS, which it
seems we can just ignore, then with err == 0.

On sites with the `discourse-microsoft-auth` plugin enabled, an attack can potentially take control of a victim's Discourse account. Sites that have configured their application's account type to any options other than `Accounts in this organizational directory only (O365 only - Single tenant)` are vulnerable. This vulnerability has been patched in commit c40665f44509724b64938c85def9fb2e79f62ec8 of `discourse-microsoft-auth`. A `microsoft_auth:revoke` rake task has also been added which will deactivate and log out all users that have connected their accounts to Microsoft. User API keys as well as API keys created by those users will also be revoked. The rake task will also remove the connection records to Microsoft for those users. This will allow affected users to re-verify their account emails as well as reconnect their Discourse account to Microsoft for authentication. As a workaround, disable the `discourse-microsoft-auth` plugin by setting the `microsoft_auth_enabled` site setting to `false`. Run the `microsoft_auth:log_out_users` rake task to log out all users with associated Microsoft accounts.

CVE-2024-25117	2024-02-21T17:15:09.617	2025-02-05T22:09:42.130	php-svg-lib is a scalable vector graphics (SVG) file parsing/rendering library. Prior to version 0.5.2, php-svg-lib fails to validate that font-family doesn't contain a PHAR url, which might leads to RCE on PHP < 8.0, and doesn't validate if external references are allowed. This might leads to bypass of restrictions or RCE on projects that are using it, if they do not strictly revalidate the fontName that is passed by php-svg-lib. The `Style::fromAttributes(`), or the `Style::parseCssStyle()` should check the content of the `font-family` and prevents it to use a PHAR url, to avoid passing an invalid and dangerous `fontName` value to other libraries. The same check as done in the `Style::fromStyleSheets` might be reused. Libraries using this library as a dependency might be vulnerable to some bypass of restrictions, or even remote code execution, if they do not double check the value of the `fontName` that is passed by php-svg-lib. Version 0.5.2 contains a fix for this issue.	6.8	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L

Only database instances that use custom projections are affected by this vulnerability. User passwords may become accessible to those who have access to the chunk files on disk, and users who have read access to system streams. Only users in the `$admins` group can access system streams by default. ESDB 23.10.1, 22.10.5, 21.10.11, and 20.10.6 contain a patch for this issue. Users should upgrade EventStoreDB, reset the passwords for current and previous members of `$admins` and `$ops` groups, and, if a password was reused in any other system, reset it in those systems to a unique password to follow best practices. If an upgrade cannot be done immediately, reset the passwords for current and previous members of `$admins` and `$ops` groups. Avoid creating custom projections until the patch has been applied.	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L

The impact of this misconfiguration is high as it can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive user data and expose the system to various types of attacks listed in the PortSwigger article linked in the references. Version 2.52.1 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, users may manually validate the CORS configurations in their implementation to ensure that they do not allow a wildcard origin when credentials are enabled. The browser fetch api, as well as browsers and utilities that enforce CORS policies, are not affected by this.	9.4	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L

CVE-2024-26147	2024-02-21T23:15:08.763	2025-01-09T14:40:25.983	Helm is a package manager for Charts for Kubernetes. Versions prior to 3.14.2 contain an uninitialized variable vulnerability when Helm parses index and plugin yaml files missing expected content. When either an `index.yaml` file or a plugins `plugin.yaml` file were missing all metadata a panic would occur in Helm. In the Helm SDK, this is found when using the `LoadIndexFile` or `DownloadIndexFile` functions in the `repo` package or the `LoadDir` function in the `plugin` package. For the Helm client this impacts functions around adding a repository and all Helm functions if a malicious plugin is added as Helm inspects all known plugins on each invocation. This issue has been resolved in Helm v3.14.2. If a malicious plugin has been added which is causing all Helm client commands to panic, the malicious plugin can be manually removed from the filesystem. If using Helm SDK versions prior to 3.14.2, calls to affected functions can use `recover` to catch the panic.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2024-26148	2024-02-21T23:15:08.970	2025-02-05T22:02:41.717	Querybook is a user interface for querying big data. Prior to version 3.31.1, there is a vulnerability in Querybook's rich text editor that enables users to input arbitrary URLs without undergoing necessary validation. This particular security flaw allows the use of `javascript:` protocol which can potentially trigger arbitrary client-side execution. The most extreme exploit of this flaw could occur when an admin user unknowingly clicks on a cross-site scripting URL, thereby unintentionally compromising admin role access to the attacker. A patch to rectify this issue has been introduced in Querybook version `3.31.1`. The fix is backward compatible and automatically fixes existing DataDocs. There are no known workarounds for this issue, except for manually checking each URL prior to clicking on them.	6.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

apparmor: avoid crash when parsed profile name is empty

When processing a packed profile in unpack_profile() described like

 ""profile :ns::samba-dcerpcd /usr/lib*/samba/{,samba/}samba-dcerpcd {...}""

a string "":samba-dcerpcd"" is unpacked as a fully-qualified name and then
passed to aa_splitn_fqname().

aa_splitn_fqname() treats "":samba-dcerpcd"" as only containing a namespace.
Thus it returns NULL for tmpname, meanwhile tmpns is non-NULL. Later
aa_alloc_profile() crashes as the new profile name is NULL now.

It seems such behaviour of aa_splitn_fqname() is expected and checked in
other places where it is called (e.g. aa_remove_profiles). Well, there
is an explicit comment ""a ns name without a following profile is allowed""
inside.

AFAICS, nothing can prevent unpacked ""name"" to be in form like
"":samba-dcerpcd"" - it is passed from userspace.

Deny the whole profile set replacement in such case and inform user with
EPROTO and an explaining message.

bpf: Defer the free of inner map when necessary

When updating or deleting an inner map in map array or map htab, the map
may still be accessed by non-sleepable program or sleepable program.
However bpf_map_fd_put_ptr() decreases the ref-counter of the inner map
directly through bpf_map_put(), if the ref-counter is the last one
(which is true for most cases), the inner map will be freed by
ops->map_free() in a kworker. But for now, most .map_free() callbacks
don't use synchronize_rcu() or its variants to wait for the elapse of a
RCU grace period, so after the invocation of ops->map_free completes,
the bpf program which is accessing the inner map may incur
use-after-free problem.

Fix the free of inner map by invoking bpf_map_free_deferred() after both
one RCU grace period and one tasks trace RCU grace period if the inner
map has been removed from the outer map before. The deferment is
accomplished by using call_rcu() or call_rcu_tasks_trace() when
releasing the last ref-counter of bpf map. The newly-added rcu_head
field in bpf_map shares the same storage space with work field to
reduce the size of bpf_map."	6.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

The solution for the gluebi module is to run jffs2 on the UBI

creating the mtdblock device after creating mtd partition of the

bpf: Fix accesses to uninit stack slots

Privileged programs are supposed to be able to read uninitialized stack
memory (ever since 6715df8d5) but, before this patch, these accesses
were permitted inconsistently. In particular, accesses were permitted
above state->allocated_stack, but not below it. In other words, if the
stack was already ""large enough"", the access was permitted, but
otherwise the access was rejected instead of being allowed to ""grow the
stack"". This undesired rejection was happening in two places:
- in check_stack_slot_within_bounds()
- in check_stack_range_initialized()
This patch arranges for these accesses to be permitted. A bunch of tests
that were relying on the old rejection had to change; all of them were
changed to add also run unprivileged, in which case the old behavior
persists. One tests couldn't be updated - global_func16 - because it
can't run unprivileged for other reasons.

This patch also fixes the tracking of the stack size for variable-offset
reads. This second fix is bundled in the same commit as the first one
because they're inter-related. Before this patch, writes to the stack
using registers containing a variable offset (as opposed to registers
with fixed, known values) were not properly contributing to the
function's needed stack size. As a result, it was possible for a program
to verify, but then to attempt to read out-of-bounds data at runtime
because a too small stack had been allocated for it.

Each function tracks the size of the stack it needs in
bpf_subprog_info.stack_depth, which is maintained by
update_stack_depth(). For regular memory accesses, check_mem_access()
was calling update_state_depth() but it was passing in only the fixed
part of the offset register, ignoring the variable offset. This was
incorrect; the minimum possible value of that register should be used
instead.

This tracking is now fixed by centralizing the tracking of stack size in
grow_stack_state(), and by lifting the calls to grow_stack_state() to
check_stack_access_within_bounds() as suggested by Andrii. The code is
now simpler and more convincingly tracks the correct maximum stack size.
check_stack_range_initialized() can now rely on enough stack having been
allocated for the access; this helps with the fix for the first issue.

A few tests were changed to also check the stack depth computation. The
one that fails without this patch is verifier_var_off:stack_write_priv_vs_unpriv."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix stack corruption

When tc filters are first added to a net device, the corresponding local
port gets bound to an ACL group in the device. The group contains a list
of ACLs. In turn, each ACL points to a different TCAM region where the
filters are stored. During forwarding, the ACLs are sequentially
evaluated until a match is found.

One reason to place filters in different regions is when they are added
with decreasing priorities and in an alternating order so that two
consecutive filters can never fit in the same region because of their
key usage.

In Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs the firmware started to report that the
maximum number of ACLs in a group is more than 16, but the layout of the
register that configures ACL groups (PAGT) was not updated to account
for that. It is therefore possible to hit stack corruption [1] in the
rare case where more than 16 ACLs in a group are required.

Fix by limiting the maximum ACL group size to the minimum between what
the firmware reports and the maximum ACLs that fit in the PAGT register.

Add a test case to make sure the machine does not crash when this
condition is hit.

Prior to version 2.16.3, an XML parser used by the CodeQL CLI to read various auxiliary files is vulnerable to an XML External Entity attack. If a vulnerable version of the CLI is used to process either a maliciously modified CodeQL database, or a specially prepared set of QL query sources, the CLI can be made to make an outgoing HTTP request to an URL that contains material read from a local file chosen by the attacker. This may result in a loss of privacy of exfiltration of secrets. Security researchers and QL authors who receive databases or QL source files from untrusted sources may be impacted. A single untrusted `.ql` or `.qll` file cannot be affected, but a zip archive or tarball containing QL sources may unpack auxiliary files that will trigger an attack when CodeQL sees them in the file system. Those using CodeQL for routine analysis of source trees with a preselected set of trusted queries are not affected. In particular, extracting XML files from a source tree into the CodeQL database does not make one vulnerable. The problem is fixed in release 2.16.3 of the CodeQL CLI. Other than upgrading, workarounds include not accepting CodeQL databases or queries from untrusted sources, or only processing such material on a machine without an Internet connection. Customers who use older releases of CodeQL for security scanning in an automated CI system and cannot upgrade for compliance reasons can continue using that version. That use case is safe. If such customers have a private query pack and use the `codeql pack create` command to precompile them before using them in the CI system, they should be using the production CodeQL release to run `codeql pack create`. That command is safe as long as the QL source it precompiled is trusted. All other development of the query pack should use an upgraded CLI.	2.7	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N

serial: imx: fix tx statemachine deadlock

When using the serial port as RS485 port, the tx statemachine is used to
control the RTS pin to drive the RS485 transceiver TX_EN pin. When the
TTY port is closed in the middle of a transmission (for instance during
userland application crash), imx_uart_shutdown disables the interface
and disables the Transmission Complete interrupt. afer that,
imx_uart_stop_tx bails on an incomplete transmission, to be retriggered
by the TC interrupt. This interrupt is disabled and therefore the tx
statemachine never transitions out of SEND. The statemachine is in
deadlock now, and the TX_EN remains low, making the interface useless.

imx_uart_stop_tx now checks for incomplete transmission AND whether TC
interrupts are enabled before bailing to be retriggered. This makes sure
the state machine handling is reached, and is properly set to
WAIT_AFTER_SEND."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Apparently the author of this driver expected strncat() to behave the
way that strlcat() does, which uses the size of the destination buffer
as its third argument rather than the length of the source buffer. The
result is that there is no check on the size of the allocated buffer.

Change it to strlcat().

net: dsa: fix netdev_priv() dereference before check on non-DSA netdevice events

After the blamed commit, we started doing this dereference for every
NETDEV_CHANGEUPPER and NETDEV_PRECHANGEUPPER event in the system.

static inline struct dsa_port *dsa_user_to_port(const struct net_device *dev)
{
	struct dsa_user_priv *p = netdev_priv(dev);

Which is obviously bogus, because not all net_devices have a netdev_priv()
of type struct dsa_user_priv. But struct dsa_user_priv is fairly small,
and p->dp means dereferencing 8 bytes starting with offset 16. Most
drivers allocate that much private memory anyway, making our access not
fault, and we discard the bogus data quickly afterwards, so this wasn't
caught.

But the dummy interface is somewhat special in that it calls
alloc_netdev() with a priv size of 0. So every netdev_priv() dereference
is invalid, and we get this when we emit a NETDEV_PRECHANGEUPPER event

Multiple ttys try to claim the same the minor number causing a double
unregistration of the same device. The first unregistration succeeds
but the next one results in a null-ptr-deref.

The get_free_serial_index() function returns an available minor number
but doesn't assign it immediately. The assignment is done by the caller
later. But before this assignment, calls to get_free_serial_index()
would return the same minor number.

Fix this by modifying get_free_serial_index to assign the minor number
immediately after one is found to be and rename it to obtain_minor()
to better reflect what it does. Similary, rename set_serial_by_index()
to release_minor() and modify it to free up the minor number of the

it prints a invalid-access bug report.

x86/fpu: Stop relying on userspace for info to fault in xsave buffer

Before this change, the expected size of the user space buffer was
taken from fx_sw->xstate_size. fx_sw->xstate_size can be changed
from user-space, so it is possible construct a sigreturn frame where:

 * fx_sw->xstate_size is smaller than the size required by valid bits in
   fx_sw->xfeatures.
 * user-space unmaps parts of the sigrame fpu buffer so that not all of
   the buffer required by xrstor is accessible.

In this case, xrstor tries to restore and accesses the unmapped area
which results in a fault. But fault_in_readable succeeds because buf +
fx_sw->xstate_size is within the still mapped area, so it goes back and
tries xrstor again. It will spin in this loop forever.

Instead, fault in the maximum size which can be touched by XRSTOR (taken
from fpstate->user_size).

IB/hfi1: Fix bugs with non-PAGE_SIZE-end multi-iovec user SDMA requests

hfi1 user SDMA request processing has two bugs that can cause data
corruption for user SDMA requests that have multiple payload iovecs
where an iovec other than the tail iovec does not run up to the page
boundary for the buffer pointed to by that iovec.a

Here are the specific bugs:
1. user_sdma_txadd() does not use struct user_sdma_iovec->iov.iov_len.
   Rather, user_sdma_txadd() will add up to PAGE_SIZE bytes from iovec
   to the packet, even if some of those bytes are past
   iovec->iov.iov_len and are thus not intended to be in the packet.
2. user_sdma_txadd() and user_sdma_send_pkts() fail to advance to the
   next iovec in user_sdma_request->iovs when the current iovec
   is not PAGE_SIZE and does not contain enough data to complete the
   packet. The transmitted packet will contain the wrong data from the
   iovec pages.

This has not been an issue with SDMA packets from hfi1 Verbs or PSM2
because they only produce iovecs that end short of PAGE_SIZE as the tail
iovec of an SDMA request.

Fixing these bugs exposes other bugs with the SDMA pin cache
(struct mmu_rb_handler) that get in way of supporting user SDMA requests
with multiple payload iovecs whose buffers do not end at PAGE_SIZE. So
this commit fixes those issues as well.

Here are the mmu_rb_handler bugs that non-PAGE_SIZE-end multi-iovec
payload user SDMA requests can hit:
1. Overlapping memory ranges in mmu_rb_handler will result in duplicate
   pinnings.
2. When extending an existing mmu_rb_handler entry (struct mmu_rb_node),
   the mmu_rb code (1) removes the existing entry under a lock, (2)
   releases that lock, pins the new pages, (3) then reacquires the lock
   to insert the extended mmu_rb_node.

   If someone else comes in and inserts an overlapping entry between (2)
   and (3), insert in (3) will fail.

   The failure path code in this case unpins _all_ pages in either the
   original mmu_rb_node or the new mmu_rb_node that was inserted between
   (2) and (3).
3. In hfi1_mmu_rb_remove_unless_exact(), mmu_rb_node->refcount is
   incremented outside of mmu_rb_handler->lock. As a result, mmu_rb_node
   could be evicted by another thread that gets mmu_rb_handler->lock and
   checks mmu_rb_node->refcount before mmu_rb_node->refcount is
   incremented.
4. Related to #2 above, SDMA request submission failure path does not
   check mmu_rb_node->refcount before freeing mmu_rb_node object.

   If there are other SDMA requests in progress whose iovecs have
   pointers to the now-freed mmu_rb_node(s), those pointers to the
   now-freed mmu_rb nodes will be dereferenced when those SDMA requests
   complete."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

In version 0.0.31 and earlier, it is possible for an attacker to register a repository with a invalid or differing upstream ID, which causes Minder to report the repository as registered, but not remediate any future changes which conflict with policy (because the webhooks for the repo do not match any known repository in the database).  When attempting to register a repo with a different repo ID, the registered provider must have admin on the named repo, or a 404 error will result.  Similarly, if the stored provider token does not have repo access, then the remediations will not apply successfully.  Lastly, it appears that reconciliation actions do not execute against repos with this type of mismatch. This appears to primarily be a potential denial-of-service vulnerability.

ARM: 9063/1: mm: reduce maximum number of CPUs if DEBUG_KMAP_LOCAL is enabled

The debugging code for kmap_local() doubles the number of per-CPU fixmap
slots allocated for kmap_local(), in order to use half of them as guard
regions. This causes the fixmap region to grow downwards beyond the start
of its reserved window if the supported number of CPUs is large, and collide
with the newly added virtual DT mapping right below it, which is obviously
not good.

One manifestation of this is EFI boot on a kernel built with NR_CPUS=32
and CONFIG_DEBUG_KMAP_LOCAL=y, which may pass the FDT in highmem, resulting
in block entries below the fixmap region that the fixmap code misidentifies
as fixmap table entries, and subsequently tries to dereference using a
phys-to-virt translation that is only valid for lowmem. This results in a
cryptic splat such as the one below.

net: Make tcp_allowed_congestion_control readonly in non-init netns

Currently, tcp_allowed_congestion_control is global and writable;
writing to it in any net namespace will leak into all other net
namespaces.

tcp_available_congestion_control and tcp_allowed_congestion_control are
the only sysctls in ipv4_net_table (the per-netns sysctl table) with a
NULL data pointer; their handlers (proc_tcp_available_congestion_control
and proc_allowed_congestion_control) have no other way of referencing a
struct net. Thus, they operate globally.

Because ipv4_net_table does not use designated initializers, there is no
easy way to fix up this one ""bad"" table entry. However, the data pointer
updating logic shouldn't be applied to NULL pointers anyway, so we
instead force these entries to be read-only.

These sysctls used to exist in ipv4_table (init-net only), but they were
moved to the per-net ipv4_net_table, presumably without realizing that
tcp_allowed_congestion_control was writable and thus introduced a leak.

Because the intent of that commit was only to know (i.e. read) ""which
congestion algorithms are available or allowed"", this read-only solution
should be sufficient.

The logic added in recent commit
31c4d2f160eb: (""net: Ensure net namespace isolation of sysctls"")
does not and cannot check for NULL data pointers, because
other table entries (e.g. /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_log/) have
.data=NULL but use other methods (.extra2) to access the struct net."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

locking/qrwlock: Fix ordering in queued_write_lock_slowpath()

While this code is executed with the wait_lock held, a reader can
acquire the lock without holding wait_lock.  The writer side loops
checking the value with the atomic_cond_read_acquire(), but only truly
acquires the lock when the compare-and-exchange is completed
successfully which isn’t ordered. This exposes the window between the
acquire and the cmpxchg to an A-B-A problem which allows reads
following the lock acquisition to observe values speculatively before
the write lock is truly acquired.

We've seen a problem in epoll where the reader does a xchg while
holding the read lock, but the writer can see a value change out from
under it.

A core can order the read of the ovflist ahead of the
atomic_cmpxchg_relaxed(). Switching the cmpxchg to use acquire
semantics addresses this issue at which point the atomic_cond_read can
be switched to use relaxed semantics.

To make sure we won't receive any CDC messages after we free the
smc_sock, add a refcount on the smc_connection for inflight CDC
message(posted to the QP but haven't received related CQE), and
don't release the smc_connection until all the inflight CDC messages
haven been done, for both success or failed ones.

Using refcount on CDC messages brings another problem: when the link
is going to be destroyed, smcr_link_clear() will reset the QP, which
then remove all the pending CQEs related to the QP in the CQ. To make
sure all the CQEs will always come back so the refcount on the
smc_connection can always reach 0, smc_ib_modify_qp_reset() was replaced
by smc_ib_modify_qp_error().
And remove the timeout in smc_wr_tx_wait_no_pending_sends() since we
need to wait for all pending WQEs done, or we may encounter use-after-
free when handling CQEs.

For IB device removal routine, we need to wait for all the QPs on that
device been destroyed before we can destroy CQs on the device, or
the refcount on smc_connection won't reach 0 and smc_sock cannot be
released."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

This issue occurs when asoc is peeled off and the old sk is freed after
getting it by asoc->base.sk and before calling lock_sock(sk).

To prevent the sk free, as a holder of the sk, ep should be alive when
calling lock_sock(). This patch uses call_rcu() and moves sock_put and
ep free into sctp_endpoint_destroy_rcu(), so that it's safe to try to
hold the ep under rcu_read_lock in sctp_transport_traverse_process().

If sctp_endpoint_hold() returns true, it means this ep is still alive
and we have held it and can continue to dump it; If it returns false,
it means this ep is dead and can be freed after rcu_read_unlock, and
we should skip it.

In sctp_sock_dump(), after locking the sk, if this ep is different from
tsp->asoc->ep, it means during this dumping, this asoc was peeled off
before calling lock_sock(), and the sk should be skipped; If this ep is
the same with tsp->asoc->ep, it means no peeloff happens on this asoc,
and due to lock_sock, no peeloff will happen either until release_sock.

Note that delaying endpoint free won't delay the port release, as the
port release happens in sctp_endpoint_destroy() before calling call_rcu().
Also, freeing endpoint by call_rcu() makes it safe to access the sk by
asoc->base.sk in sctp_assocs_seq_show() and sctp_rcv().

Thanks Jones to bring this issue up.

v1->v2:
  - improve the changelog.
  - add kfree(ep) into sctp_endpoint_destroy_rcu(), as Jakub noticed."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

usb: gadget: f_fs: Clear ffs_eventfd in ffs_data_clear.

ffs_data_clear is indirectly called from both ffs_fs_kill_sb and
ffs_ep0_release, so it ends up being called twice when userland closes ep0
and then unmounts f_fs.
If userland provided an eventfd along with function's USB descriptors, it
ends up calling eventfd_ctx_put as many times, causing a refcount
underflow.
NULL-ify ffs_eventfd to prevent these extraneous eventfd_ctx_put calls.

Also, set epfiles to NULL right after de-allocating it, for readability.

For completeness, ffs_data_clear actually ends up being called thrice, the
last call being before the whole ffs structure gets freed, so when this
specific sequence happens there is a second underflow happening (but not
being reported):

binder: fix async_free_space accounting for empty parcels

In 4.13, commit 74310e06be4d (""android: binder: Move buffer out of area shared with user space"")
fixed a kernel structure visibility issue. As part of that patch,
sizeof(void *) was used as the buffer size for 0-length data payloads so
the driver could detect abusive clients sending 0-length asynchronous
transactions to a server by enforcing limits on async_free_size.

Unfortunately, on the ""free"" side, the accounting of async_free_space
did not add the sizeof(void *) back. The result was that up to 8-bytes of
async_free_space were leaked on every async transaction of 8-bytes or
less.  These small transactions are uncommon, so this accounting issue
has gone undetected for several years.

The fix is to use ""buffer_size"" (the allocated buffer size) instead of
""size"" (the logical buffer size) when updating the async_free_space
during the free operation. These are the same except for this
corner case of asynchronous transactions with payloads < 8 bytes."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

This issue was also reported since 2017 in the thread [1],
unfortunately, the issue was still can be reproduced after fixing
DCCP.

The ipv4_mib_exit_net is called before tcp_sk_exit_batch when a net
namespace is destroyed since tcp_sk_ops is registered befrore
ipv4_mib_ops, which means tcp_sk_ops is in the front of ipv4_mib_ops
in the list of pernet_list. There will be a use-after-free on
net->mib.net_statistics in tw_timer_handler after ipv4_mib_exit_net
if there are some inflight time-wait timers.

This bug is not introduced by commit f2bf415cfed7 (""mib: add net to
NET_ADD_STATS_BH"") since the net_statistics is a global variable
instead of dynamic allocation and freeing. Actually, commit
61a7e26028b9 (""mib: put net statistics on struct net"") introduces
the bug since it put net statistics on struct net and free it when
net namespace is destroyed.

Moving init_ipv4_mibs() to the front of tcp_init() to fix this bug
and replace pr_crit() with panic() since continuing is meaningless
when init_ipv4_mibs() fails.

With the following RIP:

RIP: 0010:native_queued_spin_lock_slowpath+0x69/0x200

Since the fix to the recursion detection would allow a single recursion to
happen while tracing, this lead to the trace_clock_global() taking a spin
lock and then trying to take it again:

ring_buffer_lock_reserve() {
  trace_clock_global() {
    arch_spin_lock() {
      queued_spin_lock_slowpath() {
        /* lock taken */
        (something else gets traced by function graph tracer)
          ring_buffer_lock_reserve() {
            trace_clock_global() {
              arch_spin_lock() {
                queued_spin_lock_slowpath() {
                /* DEAD LOCK! */

Tracing should *never* block, as it can lead to strange lockups like the
above.

Restructure the trace_clock_global() code to instead of simply taking a
lock to update the recorded ""prev_time"" simply use it, as two events
happening on two different CPUs that calls this at the same time, really
doesn't matter which one goes first. Use a trylock to grab the lock for
updating the prev_time, and if it fails, simply try again the next time.
If it failed to be taken, that means something else is already updating
it.

tools/power turbostat: Fix offset overflow issue in index converting

The idx_to_offset() function returns type int (32-bit signed), but
MSR_PKG_ENERGY_STAT is u32 and would be interpreted as a negative number.
The end result is that it hits the if (offset < 0) check in update_msr_sum()
which prevents the timer callback from updating the stat in the background when
long durations are used. The similar issue exists in offset_to_idx() and
update_msr_sum(). Fix this issue by converting the 'int' to 'off_t' accordingly."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

usb: dwc3: core: Do core softreset when switch mode


According to the programming guide, to switch mode for DRD controller,
the driver needs to do the following.

To switch from device to host:
1. Reset controller with GCTL.CoreSoftReset
2. Set GCTL.PrtCapDir(host mode)
3. Reset the host with USBCMD.HCRESET
4. Then follow up with the initializing host registers sequence

To switch from host to device:
1. Reset controller with GCTL.CoreSoftReset
2. Set GCTL.PrtCapDir(device mode)
3. Reset the device with DCTL.CSftRst
4. Then follow up with the initializing registers sequence

Currently we're missing step 1) to do GCTL.CoreSoftReset and step 3) of
switching from host to device. John Stult reported a lockup issue seen
with HiKey960 platform without these steps[1]. Similar issue is observed
with Ferry's testing platform[2].

So, apply the required steps along with some fixes to Yu Chen's and John
Stultz's version. The main fixes to their versions are the missing wait
for clocks synchronization before clearing GCTL.CoreSoftReset and only
apply DCTL.CSftRst when switching from host to device.

Here's what happens to hit that BUG_ON():

1) After installing kprobe at entry of sys_read, the first instruction
   is replaced by 'ebreak' instruction on riscv64 platform.

2) Once kernel reach the 'ebreak' instruction at the entry of sys_read,
   it trap into the riscv breakpoint handler, where it do something to
   setup for coming single-step of origin instruction, including backup
   the 'sstatus' in pt_regs, followed by disable interrupt during single
   stepping via clear 'SIE' bit of 'sstatus' in pt_regs.

3) Then kernel restore to the instruction slot contains two instructions,
   one is original instruction at entry of sys_read, the other is 'ebreak'.
   Here it trigger a 'Instruction page fault' exception (value at 'scause'
   is '0xc'), if PF is not filled into PageTabe for that slot yet.

4) Again kernel trap into page fault exception handler, where it choose
   different policy according to the state of running kprobe. Because
   afte 2) the state is KPROBE_HIT_SS, so kernel reset the current kp

which is cause by a 'BUG_ON(in_nmi())' in nmi_enter().

From the call trace, we can find three interrupts (noted A, B, C above):
interrupt (A) is preempted by (B), which is further interrupted by (C).

Subsequent investigations show that (B) results in nmi_enter() being
called, but that it actually is a spurious interrupt. Furthermore,
interrupts are reenabled in the context of (B), and (C) fires with
NMI priority. We end-up with a nested NMI situation, something
we definitely do not want to (and cannot) handle.

The bug here is that spurious interrupts should never result in any
state change, and we should just return to the interrupted context.
Moving the handling of spurious interrupts as early as possible in
the GICv3 handler fixes this issue.

scsi: qla2xxx: Reserve extra IRQ vectors

Commit a6dcfe08487e (""scsi: qla2xxx: Limit interrupt vectors to number of
CPUs"") lowers the number of allocated MSI-X vectors to the number of CPUs.

That breaks vector allocation assumptions in qla83xx_iospace_config(),
qla24xx_enable_msix() and qla2x00_iospace_config(). Either of the functions
computes maximum number of qpairs as:

  ha->max_qpairs = ha->msix_count - 1 (MB interrupt) - 1 (default
                   response queue) - 1 (ATIO, in dual or pure target mode)

max_qpairs is set to zero in case of two CPUs and initiator mode. The
number is then used to allocate ha->queue_pair_map inside
qla2x00_alloc_queues(). No allocation happens and ha->queue_pair_map is
left NULL but the driver thinks there are queue pairs available.

qla2xxx_queuecommand() tries to find a qpair in the map and crashes:

  if (ha->mqenable) {
          uint32_t tag;
          uint16_t hwq;

          qpair = ha->queue_pair_map[hwq]; # <- HERE

          if (qpair)

bus: mhi: core: Fix invalid error returning in mhi_queue

mhi_queue returns an error when the doorbell is not accessible in
the current state. This can happen when the device is in non M0
state, like M3, and needs to be waken-up prior ringing the DB. This
case is managed earlier by triggering an asynchronous M3 exit via
controller resume/suspend callbacks, that in turn will cause M0
transition and DB update.

So, since it's not an error but just delaying of doorbell update, there
is no reason to return an error.

bus: mhi: pci_generic: Remove WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag from state workqueue

A recent change created a dedicated workqueue for the state-change work
with WQ_HIGHPRI (no strong reason for that) and WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flags,
but the state-change work (mhi_pm_st_worker) does not guarantee forward
progress under memory pressure, and will even wait on various memory
allocations when e.g. creating devices, loading firmware, etc... The
work is then not part of a memory reclaim path...

perf/core: Fix unconditional security_locked_down() call

Currently, the lockdown state is queried unconditionally, even though
its result is used only if the PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_INTR bit is set in
attr.sample_type. While that doesn't matter in case of the Lockdown LSM,
it causes trouble with the SELinux's lockdown hook implementation.

SELinux implements the locked_down hook with a check whether the current
task's type has the corresponding ""lockdown"" class permission
(""integrity"" or ""confidentiality"") allowed in the policy. This means
that calling the hook when the access control decision would be ignored
generates a bogus permission check and audit record.

Fix this by checking sample_type first and only calling the hook when
its result would be honored."	3.3	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

media: aspeed: fix clock handling logic

Video engine uses eclk and vclk for its clock sources and its reset
control is coupled with eclk so the current clock enabling sequence works
like below.

 Enable eclk
 De-assert Video Engine reset
 10ms delay
 Enable vclk

It introduces improper reset on the Video Engine hardware and eventually
the hardware generates unexpected DMA memory transfers that can corrupt
memory region in random and sporadic patterns. This issue is observed
very rarely on some specific AST2500 SoCs but it causes a critical
kernel panic with making a various shape of signature so it's extremely
hard to debug. Moreover, the issue is observed even when the video
engine is not actively used because udevd turns on the video engine
hardware for a short time to make a query in every boot.

To fix this issue, this commit changes the clock handling logic to make
the reset de-assertion triggered after enabling both eclk and vclk. Also,
it adds clk_unprepare call for a case when probe fails.

clk: ast2600: fix reset settings for eclk and vclk
Video engine reset setting should be coupled with eclk to match it
with the setting for previous Aspeed SoCs which is defined in
clk-aspeed.c since all Aspeed SoCs are sharing a single video engine
driver. Also, reset bit 6 is defined as 'Video Engine' reset in
datasheet so it should be de-asserted when eclk is enabled. This
commit fixes the setting."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

KVM: nVMX: Always make an attempt to map eVMCS after migration

When enlightened VMCS is in use and nested state is migrated with
vmx_get_nested_state()/vmx_set_nested_state() KVM can't map evmcs
page right away: evmcs gpa is not 'struct kvm_vmx_nested_state_hdr'
and we can't read it from VP assist page because userspace may decide
to restore HV_X64_MSR_VP_ASSIST_PAGE after restoring nested state
(and QEMU, for example, does exactly that). To make sure eVMCS is
mapped /vmx_set_nested_state() raises KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES
request.

Commit f2c7ef3ba955 (""KVM: nSVM: cancel KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES
on nested vmexit"") added KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES clearing to
nested_vmx_vmexit() to make sure MSR permission bitmap is not switched
when an immediate exit from L2 to L1 happens right after migration (caused
by a pending event, for example). Unfortunately, in the exact same
situation we still need to have eVMCS mapped so
nested_sync_vmcs12_to_shadow() reflects changes in VMCS12 to eVMCS.

As a band-aid, restore nested_get_evmcs_page() when clearing
KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES in nested_vmx_vmexit(). The 'fix' is far
from being ideal as we can't easily propagate possible failures and even if
we could, this is most likely already too late to do so. The whole
'KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES' idea for mapping eVMCS after migration
seems to be fragile as we diverge too much from the 'native' path when
vmptr loading happens on vmx_set_nested_state()."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

usb: typec: ucsi: Retrieve all the PDOs instead of just the first 4

commit 4dbc6a4ef06d (""usb: typec: ucsi: save power data objects
in PD mode"") introduced retrieval of the PDOs when connected to a
PD-capable source. But only the first 4 PDOs are received since
that is the maximum number that can be fetched at a time given the
MESSAGE_IN length limitation (16 bytes). However, as per the PD spec
a connected source may advertise up to a maximum of 7 PDOs.

If such a source is connected it's possible the PPM could have
negotiated a power contract with one of the PDOs at index greater
than 4, and would be reflected in the request data object's (RDO)
object position field. This would result in an out-of-bounds access
when the rdo_index() is used to index into the src_pdos array in
ucsi_psy_get_voltage_now().

With the help of the UBSAN -fsanitize=array-bounds checker enabled
this exact issue is revealed when connecting to a PD source adapter
that advertise 5 PDOs and the PPM enters a contract having selected
the 5th one.

__blk_mq_sched_bio_merge() gets the ctx and hctx for the current CPU and

for the current CPU again and uses that to get the corresponding Kyber
context in the passed hctx. However, the thread may be preempted between
the two calls to blk_mq_get_ctx(), and the ctx returned the second time

most of the time, but it can cause us to read garbage if the second ctx

usb: dwc3: gadget: Free gadget structure only after freeing endpoints

As part of commit e81a7018d93a (""usb: dwc3: allocate gadget structure
dynamically"") the dwc3_gadget_release() was added which will free
the dwc->gadget structure upon the device's removal when
usb_del_gadget_udc() is called in dwc3_gadget_exit().

However, simply freeing the gadget results a dangling pointer
situation: the endpoints created in dwc3_gadget_init_endpoints()
have their dep->endpoint.ep_list members chained off the list_head
anchored at dwc->gadget->ep_list.  Thus when dwc->gadget is freed,
the first dwc3_ep in the list now has a dangling prev pointer and
likewise for the next pointer of the dwc3_ep at the tail of the list.
The dwc3_gadget_free_endpoints() that follows will result in a
use-after-free when it calls list_del().

This was caught by enabling KASAN and performing a driver unbind.
The recent commit 568262bf5492 (""usb: dwc3: core: Add shutdown
callback for dwc3"") also exposes this as a panic during shutdown.

There are a few possibilities to fix this.  One could be to perform
a list_del() of the gadget->ep_list itself which removes it from
the rest of the dwc3_ep chain.

Another approach is what this patch does, by splitting up the
usb_del_gadget_udc() call into its separate ""del"" and ""put""
components.  This allows dwc3_gadget_free_endpoints() to be
called before the gadget is finally freed with usb_put_gadget()."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

btrfs: fix deadlock when cloning inline extents and using qgroups

There are a few exceptional cases where cloning an inline extent needs to
copy the inline extent data into a page of the destination inode.

When this happens, we end up starting a transaction while having a dirty
page for the destination inode and while having the range locked in the
destination's inode iotree too. Because when reserving metadata space
for a transaction we may need to flush existing delalloc in case there is
not enough free space, we have a mechanism in place to prevent a deadlock,
which was introduced in commit 3d45f221ce627d (""btrfs: fix deadlock when
cloning inline extent and low on free metadata space"").

However when using qgroups, a transaction also reserves metadata qgroup
space, which can also result in flushing delalloc in case there is not
enough available space at the moment. When this happens we deadlock, since
flushing delalloc requires locking the file range in the inode's iotree
and the range was already locked at the very beginning of the clone
operation, before attempting to start the transaction.

When this issue happens, stack traces like the following are reported:

userfaultfd: release page in error path to avoid BUG_ON

Consider the following sequence of events:

1. Userspace issues a UFFD ioctl, which ends up calling into
   shmem_mfill_atomic_pte(). We successfully account the blocks, we
   shmem_alloc_page(), but then the copy_from_user() fails. We return
   -ENOENT. We don't release the page we allocated.
2. Our caller detects this error code, tries the copy_from_user() after
   dropping the mmap_lock, and retries, calling back into
   shmem_mfill_atomic_pte().
3. Meanwhile, let's say another process filled up the tmpfs being used.

CVE-2021-46989	2024-02-28T09:15:37.687	2025-03-14T19:02:38.240	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hfsplus: prevent corruption in shrinking truncate

I believe there are some issues introduced by commit 31651c607151
(""hfsplus: avoid deadlock on file truncation"")

HFS+ has extent records which always contains 8 extents.  In case the
first extent record in catalog file gets full, new ones are allocated from
extents overflow file.

In case shrinking truncate happens to middle of an extent record which
locates in extents overflow file, the logic in hfsplus_file_truncate() was
changed so that call to hfs_brec_remove() is not guarded any more.

Right action would be just freeing the extents that exceed the new size
inside extent record by calling hfsplus_free_extents(), and then check if
the whole extent record should be removed.  However since the guard
(blk_cnt > start) is now after the call to hfs_brec_remove(), this has
unfortunate effect that the last matching extent record is removed
unconditionally.

To reproduce this issue, create a file which has at least 10 extents, and
then perform shrinking truncate into middle of the last extent record, so
that the number of remaining extents is not under or divisible by 8.  This
causes the last extent record (8 extents) to be removed totally instead of
truncating into middle of it.  Thus this causes corruption, and lost data.

Fix for this is simply checking if the new truncated end is below the
start of this extent record, making it safe to remove the full extent
record.  However call to hfs_brec_remove() can't be moved to it's previous
place since we're dropping ->tree_lock and it can cause a race condition
and the cached info being invalidated possibly corrupting the node data.

Another issue is related to this one.  When entering into the block
(blk_cnt > start) we are not holding the ->tree_lock.  We break out from
the loop not holding the lock, but hfs_find_exit() does unlock it.  Not
sure if it's possible for someone else to take the lock under our feet,
but it can cause hard to debug errors and premature unlocking.  Even if
there's no real risk of it, the locking should still always be kept in
balance.  Thus taking the lock now just before the check."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

arm64: entry: always set GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET during entry

Zenghui reports that booting a kernel with ""irqchip.gicv3_pseudo_nmi=1""
on the command line hits a warning during kernel entry, due to the way
we manipulate the PMR.

Early in the entry sequence, we call lockdep_hardirqs_off() to inform
lockdep that interrupts have been masked (as the HW sets DAIF wqhen
entering an exception). Architecturally PMR_EL1 is not affected by
exception entry, and we don't set GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET in the PMR early in
the exception entry sequence, so early in exception entry the PMR can
indicate that interrupts are unmasked even though they are masked by
DAIF.

If DEBUG_LOCKDEP is selected, lockdep_hardirqs_off() will check that
interrupts are masked, before we set GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET in any of the
exception entry paths, and hence lockdep_hardirqs_off() will WARN() that
something is amiss.

We can avoid this by consistently setting GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET during
exception entry so that kernel code sees a consistent environment. We
must also update local_daif_inherit() to undo this, as currently only
touches DAIF. For other paths, local_daif_restore() will update both
DAIF and the PMR. With this done, we can remove the existing special
cases which set this later in the entry code.

We always use (GIC_PRIO_IRQON | GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET) for consistency with
local_daif_save(), as this will warn if it ever encounters
(GIC_PRIO_IRQOFF | GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET), and never sets this itself. This
matches the gic_prio_kentry_setup that we have to retain for
ret_to_user.

This is caused by a transport use-after-free issue. When processing a
duplicate COOKIE-ECHO chunk in sctp_sf_do_dupcook_a(), both COOKIE-ACK
and SHUTDOWN chunks are allocated with the transort from the new asoc.
However, later in the sideeffect machine, the old asoc is used to send
them out and old asoc's shutdown_last_sent_to is set to the transport
that SHUTDOWN chunk attached to in sctp_cmd_setup_t2(), which actually
belongs to the new asoc. After the new_asoc is freed and the old asoc
T2 timeout, the old asoc's shutdown_last_sent_to that is already freed
would be accessed in sctp_sf_t2_timer_expire().

Thanks Alexander and Jere for helping dig into this issue.

To fix it, this patch is to do the asoc update first, then allocate
the COOKIE-ACK and SHUTDOWN chunks with the 'updated' old asoc. This
would make more sense, as a chunk from an asoc shouldn't be sent out
with another asoc. We had fixed quite a few issues caused by this."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

KVM: SVM: Make sure GHCB is mapped before updating

Access to the GHCB is mainly in the VMGEXIT path and it is known that the
GHCB will be mapped. But there are two paths where it is possible the GHCB
might not be mapped.

The sev_vcpu_deliver_sipi_vector() routine will update the GHCB to inform
the caller of the AP Reset Hold NAE event that a SIPI has been delivered.
However, if a SIPI is performed without a corresponding AP Reset Hold,
then the GHCB might not be mapped (depending on the previous VMEXIT),
which will result in a NULL pointer dereference.

The svm_complete_emulated_msr() routine will update the GHCB to inform
the caller of a RDMSR/WRMSR operation about any errors. While it is likely
that the GHCB will be mapped in this situation, add a safe guard
in this path to be certain a NULL pointer dereference is not encountered."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2021-47011	2024-02-28T09:15:38.703	2025-01-08T18:02:38.837	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: memcontrol: slab: fix obtain a reference to a freeing memcg

Patch series ""Use obj_cgroup APIs to charge kmem pages"", v5.

Since Roman's series ""The new cgroup slab memory controller"" applied.
All slab objects are charged with the new APIs of obj_cgroup.  The new
APIs introduce a struct obj_cgroup to charge slab objects.  It prevents
long-living objects from pinning the original memory cgroup in the
memory.  But there are still some corner objects (e.g.  allocations
larger than order-1 page on SLUB) which are not charged with the new
APIs.  Those objects (include the pages which are allocated from buddy
allocator directly) are charged as kmem pages which still hold a
reference to the memory cgroup.

E.g.  We know that the kernel stack is charged as kmem pages because the
size of the kernel stack can be greater than 2 pages (e.g.  16KB on
x86_64 or arm64).  If we create a thread (suppose the thread stack is
charged to memory cgroup A) and then move it from memory cgroup A to
memory cgroup B.  Because the kernel stack of the thread hold a
reference to the memory cgroup A.  The thread can pin the memory cgroup
A in the memory even if we remove the cgroup A.  If we want to see this
scenario by using the following script.  We can see that the system has
added 500 dying cgroups (This is not a real world issue, just a script
to show that the large kmallocs are charged as kmem pages which can pin
the memory cgroup in the memory).

	#!/bin/bash

	cat /proc/cgroups | grep memory

	cd /sys/fs/cgroup/memory
	echo 1 > memory.move_charge_at_immigrate

	for i in range{1..500}
	do
		mkdir kmem_test
		echo $$ > kmem_test/cgroup.procs
		sleep 3600 &
		echo $$ > cgroup.procs
		echo `cat kmem_test/cgroup.procs` > cgroup.procs
		rmdir kmem_test
	done

	cat /proc/cgroups | grep memory

This patchset aims to make those kmem pages to drop the reference to
memory cgroup by using the APIs of obj_cgroup.  Finally, we can see that
the number of the dying cgroups will not increase if we run the above test
script.

This patch (of 7):

The rcu_read_lock/unlock only can guarantee that the memcg will not be
freed, but it cannot guarantee the success of css_get (which is in the
refill_stock when cached memcg changed) to memcg.

  rcu_read_lock()
  memcg = obj_cgroup_memcg(old)
  __memcg_kmem_uncharge(memcg)
      refill_stock(memcg)
          if (stock->cached != memcg)
              // css_get can change the ref counter from 0 back to 1.
              css_get(&memcg->css)
  rcu_read_unlock()

This fix is very like the commit:

  eefbfa7fd678 (""mm: memcg/slab: fix use after free in obj_cgroup_charge"")

Fix this by holding a reference to the memcg which is passed to the
__memcg_kmem_uncharge() before calling __memcg_kmem_uncharge()."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

vsock/virtio: free queued packets when closing socket

As reported by syzbot [1], there is a memory leak while closing the
socket. We partially solved this issue with commit ac03046ece2b
(""vsock/virtio: free packets during the socket release""), but we
forgot to drain the RX queue when the socket is definitely closed by
the scheduled work.

To avoid future issues, let's use the new virtio_transport_remove_sock()
to drain the RX queue before removing the socket from the af_vsock lists
calling vsock_remove_sock().

CVE-2021-47026	2024-02-28T09:15:39.337	2025-01-09T15:04:56.983	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/rtrs-clt: destroy sysfs after removing session from active list

A session can be removed dynamically by sysfs interface ""remove_path"" that
eventually calls rtrs_clt_remove_path_from_sysfs function.  The current
rtrs_clt_remove_path_from_sysfs first removes the sysfs interfaces and
frees sess->stats object. Second it removes the session from the active
list.

Therefore some functions could access non-connected session and access the
freed sess->stats object even-if they check the session status before
accessing the session.

For instance rtrs_clt_request and get_next_path_min_inflight check the
session status and try to send IO to the session.  The session status
could be changed when they are trying to send IO but they could not catch
the change and update the statistics information in sess->stats object,
and generate use-after-free problem.
(see: ""RDMA/rtrs-clt: Check state of the rtrs_clt_sess before reading its
stats"")

This patch changes the rtrs_clt_remove_path_from_sysfs to remove the
session from the active session list and then destroy the sysfs
interfaces.

Each function still should check the session status because closing or
error recovery paths can change the status."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

powerpc/64s: Fix pte update for kernel memory on radix

When adding a PTE a ptesync is needed to order the update of the PTE
with subsequent accesses otherwise a spurious fault may be raised.

radix__set_pte_at() does not do this for performance gains. For
non-kernel memory this is not an issue as any faults of this kind are
corrected by the page fault handler. For kernel memory these faults
are not handled. The current solution is that there is a ptesync in
flush_cache_vmap() which should be called when mapping from the
vmalloc region.

However, map_kernel_page() does not call flush_cache_vmap(). This is
troublesome in particular for code patching with Strict RWX on radix.
In do_patch_instruction() the page frame that contains the instruction
to be patched is mapped and then immediately patched. With no ordering
or synchronization between setting up the PTE and writing to the page
it is possible for faults.

As the code patching is done using __put_user_asm_goto() the resulting
fault is obscured - but using a normal store instead it can be seen:

always set. When using second level, we still give separate permissions

udp: skip L4 aggregation for UDP tunnel packets

If NETIF_F_GRO_FRAGLIST or NETIF_F_GRO_UDP_FWD are enabled, and there
are UDP tunnels available in the system, udp_gro_receive() could end-up
doing L4 aggregation (either SKB_GSO_UDP_L4 or SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST) at
the outer UDP tunnel level for packets effectively carrying and UDP
tunnel header.

That could cause inner protocol corruption. If e.g. the relevant
packets carry a vxlan header, different vxlan ids will be ignored/
aggregated to the same GSO packet. Inner headers will be ignored, too,
so that e.g. TCP over vxlan push packets will be held in the GRO
engine till the next flush, etc.

Just skip the SKB_GSO_UDP_L4 and SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST code path if the
current packet could land in a UDP tunnel, and let udp_gro_receive()
do GRO via udp_sk(sk)->gro_receive.

The check implemented in this patch is broader than what is strictly
needed, as the existing UDP tunnel could be e.g. configured on top of
a different device: we could end-up skipping GRO at-all for some packets.

Anyhow, that is a very thin corner case and covering it will add quite
a bit of complexity.

Bluetooth: avoid deadlock between hci_dev->lock and socket lock

Commit eab2404ba798 (""Bluetooth: Add BT_PHY socket option"") added a
dependency between socket lock and hci_dev->lock that could lead to
deadlock.

It turns out that hci_conn_get_phy() is not in any way relying on hdev
being immutable during the runtime of this function, neither does it even
look at any of the members of hdev, and as such there is no need to hold
that lock.

This fixes the lockdep splat below:

sched/fair: Fix shift-out-of-bounds in load_balance()

Syzbot reported a handful of occurrences where an sd->nr_balance_failed can
grow to much higher values than one would expect.

A successful load_balance() resets it to 0; a failed one increments
it. Once it gets to sd->cache_nice_tries + 3, this *should* trigger an
active balance, which will either set it to sd->cache_nice_tries+1 or reset
it to 0. However, in case the to-be-active-balanced task is not allowed to
run on env->dst_cpu, then the increment is done without any further
modification.

This could then be repeated ad nauseam, and would explain the absurdly high
values reported by syzbot (86, 149). VincentG noted there is value in
letting sd->cache_nice_tries grow, so the shift itself should be
fixed. That means preventing:

  """"""
  If the value of the right operand is negative or is greater than or equal
  to the width of the promoted left operand, the behavior is undefined.
  """"""

Thus we need to cap the shift exponent to
  BITS_PER_TYPE(typeof(lefthand)) - 1.

perf/x86/lbr: Filter vsyscall addresses

We found that a panic can occur when a vsyscall is made while LBR sampling
is active. If the vsyscall is interrupted (NMI) for perf sampling, this
call sequence can occur (most recent at top):

    __insn_get_emulate_prefix()
    insn_get_emulate_prefix()
    insn_get_prefixes()
    insn_get_opcode()
    decode_branch_type()

    intel_pmu_lbr_filter()
    intel_pmu_handle_irq()
    perf_event_nmi_handler()

Within __insn_get_emulate_prefix() at frame 0, a macro is called:

    peek_nbyte_next(insn_byte_t, insn, i)

Within this macro, this dereference occurs:

    (insn)->next_byte

Inspecting registers at this point, the value of the next_byte field is the
address of the vsyscall made, for example the location of the vsyscall
version of gettimeofday() at 0xffffffffff600000. The access to an address
in the vsyscall region will trigger an oops due to an unhandled page fault.

To fix the bug, filtering for vsyscalls can be done when
determining the branch type. This patch will return
a ""none"" branch if a kernel address if found to lie in the
vsyscall region."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2023-52478	2024-02-29T06:15:45.920	2025-01-10T18:27:26.213	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: logitech-hidpp: Fix kernel crash on receiver USB disconnect

hidpp_connect_event() has *four* time-of-check vs time-of-use (TOCTOU)
races when it races with itself.

hidpp_connect_event() primarily runs from a workqueue but it also runs
on probe() and if a ""device-connected"" packet is received by the hw
when the thread running hidpp_connect_event() from probe() is waiting on
the hw, then a second thread running hidpp_connect_event() will be
started from the workqueue.

This opens the following races (note the below code is simplified):

1. Retrieving + printing the protocol (harmless race):

	if (!hidpp->protocol_major) {
		hidpp_root_get_protocol_version()
		hidpp->protocol_major = response.rap.params[0];
	}

We can actually see this race hit in the dmesg in the abrt output
attached to rhbz#2227968:

[ 3064.624215] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.
[ 3064.658184] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.

Testing with extra logging added has shown that after this the 2 threads
take turn grabbing the hw access mutex (send_mutex) so they ping-pong
through all the other TOCTOU cases managing to hit all of them:

2. Updating the name to the HIDPP name (harmless race):

	if (hidpp->name == hdev->name) {
		...
		hidpp->name = new_name;
	}

3. Initializing the power_supply class for the battery (problematic!):

hidpp_initialize_battery()
{
        if (hidpp->battery.ps)
                return 0;

	probe_battery(); /* Blocks, threads take turns executing this */

	hidpp->battery.desc.properties =
		devm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);

	hidpp->battery.ps =
		devm_power_supply_register(&hidpp->hid_dev->dev,
					   &hidpp->battery.desc, cfg);
}

4. Creating delayed input_device (potentially problematic):

	if (hidpp->delayed_input)
		return;

	hidpp->delayed_input = hidpp_allocate_input(hdev);

The really big problem here is 3. Hitting the race leads to the following
sequence:

	hidpp->battery.desc.properties =
		devm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);

	hidpp->battery.ps =
		devm_power_supply_register(&hidpp->hid_dev->dev,
					   &hidpp->battery.desc, cfg);

	...

	hidpp->battery.desc.properties =
		devm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);

	hidpp->battery.ps =
		devm_power_supply_register(&hidpp->hid_dev->dev,
					   &hidpp->battery.desc, cfg);

So now we have registered 2 power supplies for the same battery,
which looks a bit weird from userspace's pov but this is not even
the really big problem.

Notice how:

1. This is all devm-maganaged
2. The hidpp->battery.desc struct is shared between the 2 power supplies
3. hidpp->battery.desc.properties points to the result from the second
   devm_kmemdup()

This causes a use after free scenario on USB disconnect of the receiver:
1. The last registered power supply class device gets unregistered
2. The memory from the last devm_kmemdup() call gets freed,
   hidpp->battery.desc.properties now points to freed memory
3. The first registered power supply class device gets unregistered,
   this involves sending a remove uevent to userspace which invokes
   power_supply_uevent() to fill the uevent data
4. power_supply_uevent() uses hidpp->battery.desc.properties which
   now points to freed memory leading to backtraces like this one:

CVE-2023-52481	2024-02-29T06:15:46.060	2025-04-04T14:59:11.650	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: errata: Add Cortex-A520 speculative unprivileged load workaround

Implement the workaround for ARM Cortex-A520 erratum 2966298. On an
affected Cortex-A520 core, a speculatively executed unprivileged load
might leak data from a privileged load via a cache side channel. The
issue only exists for loads within a translation regime with the same
translation (e.g. same ASID and VMID). Therefore, the issue only affects
the return to EL0.

The workaround is to execute a TLBI before returning to EL0 after all
loads of privileged data. A non-shareable TLBI to any address is
sufficient.

The workaround isn't necessary if page table isolation (KPTI) is
enabled, but for simplicity it will be. Page table isolation should
normally be disabled for Cortex-A520 as it supports the CSV3 feature
and the E0PD feature (used when KASLR is enabled)."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

mctp: perform route lookups under a RCU read-side lock

Our current route lookups (mctp_route_lookup and mctp_route_lookup_null)
traverse the net's route list without the RCU read lock held. This means
the route lookup is subject to preemption, resulting in an potential
grace period expiry, and so an eventual kfree() while we still have the
route pointer.

Add the proper read-side critical section locks around the route
lookups, preventing premption and a possible parallel kfree.

The remaining net->mctp.routes accesses are already under a
rcu_read_lock, or protected by the RTNL for updates.

introducing a delay in the route lookup could cause a UAF on

Note that since 6.6-rc1 the arm_smmu_mm_invalidate_range above is renamed
to ""arm_smmu_mm_arch_invalidate_secondary_tlbs"", yet the problem remains.

The commit 06ff87bae8d3 (""arm64: mm: remove unused functions and variable
protoypes"") fixed a similar lockup on the CPU MMU side. Yet, it can occur
to SMMU too, since arm_smmu_mm_arch_invalidate_secondary_tlbs() is called
typically next to MMU tlb flush function, e.g.
	tlb_flush_mmu_tlbonly {
		tlb_flush {
			__flush_tlb_range {
				// check MAX_TLBI_OPS
			}
		}
		mmu_notifier_arch_invalidate_secondary_tlbs {
			arm_smmu_mm_arch_invalidate_secondary_tlbs {
				// does not check MAX_TLBI_OPS
			}
		}
	}

Clone a CMDQ_MAX_TLBI_OPS from the MAX_TLBI_OPS in tlbflush.h, since in an
SVA case SMMU uses the CPU page table, so it makes sense to align with the
tlbflush code. Then, replace per-page TLBI commands with a single per-asid
TLBI command, if the request size hits this threshold."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

The issue here is as follows:

- tidss probes, but is deferred as sii902x is still missing.
- sii902x starts probing and enters sii902x_init().
- sii902x calls drm_bridge_add(). Now the sii902x bridge is ready from
  DRM's perspective.
- sii902x calls sii902x_audio_codec_init() and
  platform_device_register_data()
- The registration of the audio platform device causes probing of the
  deferred devices.
- tidss probes, which eventually causes sii902x_bridge_get_edid() to be
  called.
- sii902x_bridge_get_edid() tries to use the i2c to read the edid.
  However, the sii902x driver has not set up the i2c part yet, leading
  to the crash.

Fix this by moving the drm_bridge_add() to the end of the
sii902x_init(), which is also at the very end of sii902x_probe()."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

drm_connector is devm-allocated, by the time drm_mode_config_cleanup()
will be called, our connector will be long gone. Therefore, the
connector must be cleaned up when the bridge is detached to avoid
use-after-free conditions.

The statement where an array is being overrun is shown in the following snippet:

	if (rate <= DESC_RATE11M)
		tx_power = pwr_idx_2g->cck_base[group];
	else
====>		tx_power = pwr_idx_2g->bw40_base[group];

The associated arrays are defined in main.h as follows:

struct rtw_2g_txpwr_idx {
	u8 cck_base[6];
	u8 bw40_base[5];
	struct rtw_2g_1s_pwr_idx_diff ht_1s_diff;
	struct rtw_2g_ns_pwr_idx_diff ht_2s_diff;
	struct rtw_2g_ns_pwr_idx_diff ht_3s_diff;
	struct rtw_2g_ns_pwr_idx_diff ht_4s_diff;
};

The problem arises because the value of group is 5 for channel 14. The trivial
increase in the dimension of bw40_base fails as this struct must match the layout of
efuse. The fix is to add the rate as an argument to rtw_get_channel_group() and set
the group for channel 14 to 4 if rate <= DESC_RATE11M.

CVE-2021-47066	2024-02-29T23:15:08.057	2025-01-09T19:44:50.610	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

async_xor: increase src_offs when dropping destination page

Now we support sharing one page if PAGE_SIZE is not equal stripe size. To
support this, it needs to support calculating xor value with different
offsets for each r5dev. One offset array is used to record those offsets.

In RMW mode, parity page is used as a source page. It sets
ASYNC_TX_XOR_DROP_DST before calculating xor value in ops_run_prexor5.
So it needs to add src_list and src_offs at the same time. Now it only
needs src_list. So the xor value which is calculated is wrong. It can
cause data corruption problem.

I can reproduce this problem 100% on a POWER8 machine. The steps are:

  mdadm -CR /dev/md0 -l5 -n3 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1 --size=3G
  mkfs.xfs /dev/md0

net/nfc: fix use-after-free llcp_sock_bind/connect

Commits 8a4cd82d (""nfc: fix refcount leak in llcp_sock_connect()"")
and c33b1cc62 (""nfc: fix refcount leak in llcp_sock_bind()"")
fixed a refcount leak bug in bind/connect but introduced a
use-after-free if the same local is assigned to 2 different sockets.

This can be triggered by the following simple program:
    int sock1 = socket( AF_NFC, SOCK_STREAM, NFC_SOCKPROTO_LLCP );
    int sock2 = socket( AF_NFC, SOCK_STREAM, NFC_SOCKPROTO_LLCP );
    memset( &addr, 0, sizeof(struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp) );

    bind( sock2, (struct sockaddr*) &addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp) )
    close(sock1);
    close(sock2);

Fix this by assigning NULL to llcp_sock->local after calling
nfc_llcp_local_put.
