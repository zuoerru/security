Protection was added, to address CVE-2019-9848, to block calling LibreLogo from document event script handers, e.g. mouse over. However LibreOffice also has a separate feature where documents can specify that pre-installed scripts can be executed on various global script events such as document-open, etc. In the fixed versions, global script event handlers are validated equivalently to document script event handlers. This issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice versions prior to 6.2.6.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2019-9852	2019-08-15T22:15:22.350	2024-11-21T04:52:26.423	LibreOffice has a feature where documents can specify that pre-installed macros can be executed on various script events such as mouse-over, document-open etc. Access is intended to be restricted to scripts under the share/Scripts/python, user/Scripts/python sub-directories of the LibreOffice install. Protection was added, to address CVE-2018-16858, to avoid a directory traversal attack where scripts in arbitrary locations on the file system could be executed. However this new protection could be bypassed by a URL encoding attack. In the fixed versions, the parsed url describing the script location is correctly encoded before further processing.

CVE-2019-15239	2019-08-20T08:15:11.717	2024-11-21T04:28:16.163	In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. NOTE: this affects (for example) Linux distributions that use 4.9.x longterm kernels before 4.9.190 or 4.14.x longterm kernels before 4.14.139.	7.2	HIGH	AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C		
CVE-2019-12889	2019-08-20T12:15:10.770	2024-11-21T04:23:46.077	An unauthenticated privilege escalation exists in SailPoint Desktop Password Reset 7.2. A user with local access to only the Windows logon screen can escalate their privileges to NT AUTHORITY\System. An attacker would need local access to the machine for a successful exploit. The attacker must disconnect the computer from the local network / WAN and connect it to an internet facing access point / network. At that point, the attacker can execute the password-reset functionality, which will expose a web browser. Browsing to a site that calls local Windows system functions (e.g., file upload) will expose the local file system. From there an attacker can launch a privileged command shell.	6.9	MEDIUM	AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C

The eXecute-Only-Memory (XOM) implementation prevents code read-outs on protected memory by generating bus faults. However, single-stepping and using breakpoints is allowed in XOM-protected flash memory. As a consequence, it is possible to execute single instructions with arbitrary system states (e.g., registers, status flags, and SRAM content) and observe the state changes produced by the unknown instruction. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing protected and unknown instructions with specific system states and observing the state changes. Based on the gathered information, it is possible to reverse-engineer the executed instructions. The processor acts as a kind of ""instruction oracle."""	2.1	LOW	AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N

CVE-2019-12643	2019-08-28T19:15:10.757	2024-11-21T04:23:14.753	A vulnerability in the Cisco REST API virtual service container for Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication on the managed Cisco IOS XE device. The vulnerability is due to an improper check performed by the area of code that manages the REST API authentication service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting malicious HTTP requests to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain the token-id of an authenticated user. This token-id could be used to bypass authentication and execute privileged actions through the interface of the REST API virtual service container on the affected Cisco IOS XE device. The REST API interface is not enabled by default and must be installed and activated separately on IOS XE devices. See the Details section for more information.	10.0	HIGH	AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C		
CVE-2019-1962	2019-08-28T19:15:10.867	2024-11-21T04:37:46.613	A vulnerability in the Cisco Fabric Services component of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause process crashes, which can result in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of TCP packets when processed by the Cisco Fabric Services over IP (CFSoIP) feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Fabric Services TCP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause process crashes, resulting in a device reload and a DoS condition. Note: There are three distribution methods that can be configured for Cisco Fabric Services. This vulnerability affects only distribution method CFSoIP, which is disabled by default. See the Details section for more information.	7.8	HIGH	AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C		
CVE-2019-1963	2019-08-28T19:15:10.913	2024-11-21T04:37:46.770	A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) input packet processor of Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the SNMP application on an affected device to restart unexpectedly. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)-encoded variables in SNMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP packet to the SNMP daemon on the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the SNMP application to restart multiple times, leading to a system-level restart and a denial of service (DoS) condition.	6.8	MEDIUM	AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:C		
CVE-2019-1964	2019-08-28T19:15:10.973	2024-11-21T04:37:46.927	A vulnerability in the IPv6 traffic processing of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an unexpected restart of the netstack process on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of IPv6 traffic sent through an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed IPv6 packet through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition while the netstack process restarts. A sustained attack could lead to a reboot of the device.	7.8	HIGH	AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C		
CVE-2019-1965	2019-08-28T19:15:11.053	2024-11-21T04:37:47.067	A vulnerability in the Virtual Shell (VSH) session management for Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a VSH process to fail to delete upon termination. This can lead to a build-up of VSH processes that overtime can deplete system memory. When there is no system memory available, this can cause unexpected system behaviors and crashes. The vulnerability is due to the VSH process not being properly deleted when a remote management connection to the device is disconnected. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly performing a remote management connection to the device and terminating the connection in an unexpected manner. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the VSH processes to fail to delete, which can lead to a system-wide denial of service (DoS) condition. The attacker must have valid user credentials to log in to the device using the remote management connection.	7.7	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H

The code mishandles the case of sending a network packet with the right type, such that the function DecodeEthernet in decode-ethernet.c is executed a second time. At this point, the algorithm cuts the first part of the packet and doesn't determine the current length. Specifically, if the packet is exactly 28 long, in the first iteration it subtracts 14 bytes. Then, it is working with a packet length of 14. At this point, the case distinction says it is a valid packet. After that it casts the packet, but this packet has no type, and the program crashes at the type case distinction.	5.0	MEDIUM	AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P

CVE-2019-1966	2019-08-30T09:15:20.193	2024-11-21T04:37:47.227	A vulnerability in a specific CLI command within the local management (local-mgmt) context for Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain elevated privileges as the root user on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to extraneous subcommand options present for a specific CLI command within the local-mgmt context. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device, entering the local-mgmt context, and issuing a specific CLI command and submitting user input. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands as root on an affected device. The attacker would need to have valid user credentials for the device.	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2019-1967	2019-08-30T09:15:20.287	2024-11-21T04:37:47.367	A vulnerability in the Network Time Protocol (NTP) feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to excessive use of system resources when the affected device is logging a drop action for received MODE_PRIVATE (Mode 7) NTP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by flooding the device with a steady stream of Mode 7 NTP packets. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause high CPU and memory usage on the affected device, which could cause internal system processes to restart or cause the affected device to unexpectedly reload. Note: The NTP feature is enabled by default.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2019-1968	2019-08-30T09:15:20.380	2024-11-21T04:37:47.520	A vulnerability in the NX-API feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an NX-API system process to unexpectedly restart. The vulnerability is due to incorrect validation of the HTTP header of a request that is sent to the NX-API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the NX-API on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition in the NX-API service; however, the NX-OS device itself would still be available and passing network traffic. Note: The NX-API feature is disabled by default.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2019-1969	2019-08-30T09:15:20.443	2024-11-21T04:37:47.670	A vulnerability in the implementation of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Access Control List (ACL) feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform SNMP polling of an affected device, even if it is configured to deny SNMP traffic. The vulnerability is due to an incorrect length check when the configured ACL name is the maximum length, which is 32 ASCII characters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing SNMP polling of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform SNMP polling that should have been denied. The attacker has no control of the configuration of the SNMP ACL name.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N		
CVE-2019-1977	2019-08-30T09:15:20.553	2024-11-21T04:37:48.753	A vulnerability within the Endpoint Learning feature of Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches running in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an endpoint device in certain circumstances. The vulnerability is due to improper endpoint learning when packets are received on a specific port from outside the ACI fabric and destined to an endpoint located on a border leaf when Disable Remote Endpoint Learning has been enabled. This can result in a Remote (XR) entry being created for the impacted endpoint that will become stale if the endpoint migrates to a different port or leaf switch. This results in traffic not reaching the impacted endpoint until the Remote entry can be relearned by another mechanism.	4.3	MEDIUM	AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P
