CVE-2018-1000030	2018-02-08T17:29:00.177	2024-11-21T03:39:28.167	Python 2.7.14 is vulnerable to a Heap-Buffer-Overflow as well as a Heap-Use-After-Free. Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerable and it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable however this has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free, Thread3->Malloc->Thread1->Free's->Thread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory. The PSRT has stated that this is not a security vulnerability due to the fact that the attacker must be able to run code, however in some situations, such as function as a service, this vulnerability can potentially be used by an attacker to violate a trust boundary, as such the DWF feels this issue deserves a CVE.	3.6	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L

CVE-2018-7284	2018-02-22T00:29:01.000	2024-11-21T04:11:56.303	A Buffer Overflow issue was discovered in Asterisk through 13.19.1, 14.x through 14.7.5, and 15.x through 15.2.1, and Certified Asterisk through 13.18-cert2. When processing a SUBSCRIBE request, the res_pjsip_pubsub module stores the accepted formats present in the Accept headers of the request. This code did not limit the number of headers it processed, despite having a fixed limit of 32. If more than 32 Accept headers were present, the code would write outside of its memory and cause a crash.	5.0	MEDIUM	AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P		
CVE-2018-7285	2018-02-22T00:29:01.063	2024-11-21T04:11:56.460	A NULL pointer access issue was discovered in Asterisk 15.x through 15.2.1. The RTP support in Asterisk maintains its own registry of dynamic codecs and desired payload numbers. While an SDP negotiation may result in a codec using a different payload number, these desired ones are still stored internally. When an RTP packet was received, this registry would be consulted if the payload number was not found in the negotiated SDP. This registry was incorrectly consulted for all packets, even those which are dynamic. If the payload number resulted in a codec of a different type than the RTP stream (for example, the payload number resulted in a video codec but the stream carried audio), a crash could occur if no stream of that type had been negotiated. This was due to the code incorrectly assuming that a stream of that type would always exist.	5.0	MEDIUM	AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P		
CVE-2018-7286	2018-02-22T00:29:01.110	2024-11-21T04:11:56.600	An issue was discovered in Asterisk through 13.19.1, 14.x through 14.7.5, and 15.x through 15.2.1, and Certified Asterisk through 13.18-cert2. res_pjsip allows remote authenticated users to crash Asterisk (segmentation fault) by sending a number of SIP INVITE messages on a TCP or TLS connection and then suddenly closing the connection.	4.0	MEDIUM	AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:P
