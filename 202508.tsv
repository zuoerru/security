This vulnerability allows for remote code execution (RCE) by deceiving victims into loading a seemingly harmless checkpoint during a normal training process, thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the targeted machine. Note that the payload file is a hidden file, making it difficult for the victim to detect tampering. More importantly, during the model training process, after the `.mdl` file is loaded and executes arbitrary code, the normal training process remains unaffected'meaning the user remains unaware of the arbitrary code execution.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

In versions 0.9.2 and below, the github/workflows/release-canary.yml GitHub Actions repository workflow improperly used the pull_request_target event trigger, which allowed for untrusted code from a forked pull request to be executed in a privileged context. An attacker could create a pull request containing a malicious preinstall script in the package.json file and then trigger the vulnerable workflow by posting a specific comment (!canary). This allowed for arbitrary code execution, leading to the exfiltration of sensitive secrets such as GITHUB_TOKEN and NPM_TOKEN, and could have allowed an attacker to push malicious code to the repository or publish compromised packages to the NPM registry. There is a remediation commit which removes github/workflows/release-canary.yml, but a version with this fix has yet to be released.	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2025-54801	2025-08-06T00:15:31.033	2025-09-23T23:27:27.047	Fiber is an Express inspired web framework written in Go. In versions 2.52.8 and below, when using Fiber's Ctx.BodyParser to parse form data containing a large numeric key that represents a slice index (e.g., test.18446744073704), the application crashes due to an out-of-bounds slice allocation in the underlying schema decoder. The root cause is that the decoder attempts to allocate a slice of length idx + 1 without validating whether the index is within a safe or reasonable range. If the idx is excessively large, this leads to an integer overflow or memory exhaustion, causing a panic or crash. This is fixed in version 2.52.9.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

In versions 3.1.5 through 4.2.24, 4.3.0 through 4.3.11 and 4.4.0 through 4.4.3, Mastodon's rate-limiting system has a critical configuration error where the email-based throttle for confirmation emails incorrectly checks the password reset path instead of the confirmation path, effectively disabling per-email limits for confirmation requests. This allows attackers to bypass rate limits by rotating IP addresses and send unlimited confirmation emails to any email address, as only a weak IP-based throttle (25 requests per 5 minutes) remains active. The vulnerability enables denial-of-service attacks that can overwhelm mail queues and facilitate user harassment through confirmation email spam. This is fixed in versions 4.2.24, 4.3.11 and 4.4.3.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L		
CVE-2025-54883	2025-08-06T00:15:32.050	2025-08-06T20:23:37.600	Vision UI is a collection of enterprise-grade, dependency-free modules for modern web projects. In versions 1.4.0 and below, the getSecureRandomInt function in security-kit versions prior to 3.5.0 (packaged in Vision-ui <= 1.4.0) contains a critical cryptographic weakness. Due to a silent 32-bit integer overflow in its internal masking logic, the function fails to produce a uniform distribution of random numbers when the requested range between min and max is larger than 2³². The root cause is the use of a 32-bit bitwise left-shift operation (<<) to generate a bitmask for the rejection sampling algorithm. This causes the mask to be incorrect for any range requiring 32 or more bits of entropy. This issue is fixed in version 1.5.0.					
CVE-2025-54884	2025-08-06T00:15:32.210	2025-08-06T20:23:37.600	Vision UI is a collection of enterprise-grade, dependency-free modules for modern web projects. In versions 1.4.0 and below, the generateSecureId and getSecureRandomInt functions in security-kit versions prior to 3.5.0 (packaged in Vision UI 1.4.0 and below) are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The generateSecureId(length) function directly used the length parameter to size a Uint8Array buffer, allowing attackers to exhaust server memory through repeated requests for large IDs since the previous 1024 limit was insufficient. The getSecureRandomInt(min, max) function calculated buffer size based on the range between min and max, where large ranges caused excessive memory allocation and CPU-intensive rejection-sampling loops that could hang the thread. This issue is fixed in version 1.5.0.

CVE-2025-50234	2025-08-06T15:15:32.167	2025-08-18T15:38:30.980	MCCMS v2.7.0 has an SSRF vulnerability located in the index() method of the sys\apps\controllers\api\Gf.php file, where the pic parameter is processed. The pic parameter is decrypted using the sys_auth($pic, 1) function, which utilizes a hard-coded key Mc_Encryption_Key (bD2voYwPpNuJ7B8), defined in the db.php file. The decrypted URL is passed to the geturl() method, which uses cURL to make a request to the URL without proper security checks. An attacker can craft a malicious encrypted pic parameter, which, when decrypted, points to internal addresses or local file paths (such as http://127.0.0.1 or file://). By using the file:// protocol, the attacker can access arbitrary files on the local file system (e.g., file:///etc/passwd, file:///C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts), allowing them to read sensitive configuration files, log files, and more, leading to information leakage or system exposure. The danger of this SSRF vulnerability includes accessing internal services and local file systems through protocols like http://, ftp://, and file://, which can result in sensitive data leakage, remote code execution, privilege escalation, or full system compromise, severely affecting the system's security and stability.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

Cisco has addressed this vulnerability in the Cisco Webex Meetings service, and no customer action is needed.

This vulnerability existed due to client certificate validation issues. Prior to this vulnerability being addressed, an attacker could have exploited this vulnerability by monitoring local wireless or adjacent networks for client-join requests and attempting to interrupt and complete the meeting-join flow as another user who was currently joining a meeting. To successfully exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would need the capability to position themselves in a local wireless or adjacent network, to monitor and intercept the targeted network traffic flows, and to satisfy timing requirements in order to interrupt the meeting-join flow and exploit the vulnerability. A successful exploit could have allowed the attacker to join the meeting as another user. However, the Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory."	5.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N

Unlike the http-01 challenge which solves an ACME challenge over unencrypted HTTP, the ACME protocol requires HTTPS when a client communicates with the CA to performs ACME functions. However, the library fails to enforce HTTPS both in the original discover URL (configured by the library user) and in the subsequent addresses returned by the CAs in the directory and order objects. If users input HTTP URLs or CAs misconfigure endpoints, protocol operations occur over HTTP instead of HTTPS. This compromises privacy by exposing request/response details like account and request identifiers to network attackers. This was fixed in version 4.25.2.					
CVE-2025-54882	2025-08-07T01:15:26.527	2025-10-09T17:36:51.513	Himmelblau is an interoperability suite for Microsoft Azure Entra ID and Intune. In versions 0.8.0 through 0.9.21 and 1.0.0-beta through 1.1.0, Himmelblau stores the cloud TGT received during logon in the Kerberos credential cache. The created credential cache collection and received credentials are stored as world readable. This is fixed in versions 0.9.22 and 1.2.0. To work around this issue, remove all read access to Himmelblau caches for all users except for owners.	7.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2025-54885	2025-08-07T01:15:26.693	2025-08-07T21:26:37.453	Thinbus Javascript Secure Remote Password is a browser SRP6a implementation for zero-knowledge password authentication. In versions 2.0.0 and below, a protocol compliance bug causes the client to generate a fixed 252 bits of entropy instead of the intended bit length of the safe prime (defaulted to 2048 bits). The client public value is being generated from a private value that is 4 bits below the specification. This reduces the protocol's designed security margin it is now practically exploitable. The servers full sized 2048 bit random number is used to create the shared session key and password proof. This is fixed in version 2.0.1.

CVE-2025-7054	2025-08-07T16:15:31.460	2025-08-14T19:58:57.683	"Cloudflare quiche was discovered to be vulnerable to an infinite loop when sending packets containing RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames.

QUIC connections possess a set of connection identifiers (IDs); see  Section 5.1 of RFC 9000 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-5.1 . Once the QUIC handshake completes, a local endpoint is responsible for issuing and retiring Connection IDs that are used by the remote peer to populate the Destination Connection ID field in packets sent from remote to local. Each Connection ID has a sequence number to ensure synchronization between peers.

An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by first completing a handshake and then sending a specially-crafted set of frames that trigger a connection ID retirement in the victim. When the victim attempts to send a packet containing RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames,  Section 19.16 of RFC 9000 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-19.6  requires that the sequence number of the retired connection ID must not be the same as the sequence number of the connection ID used by the packet. In other words, a packet cannot contain a frame that retires itself. In scenarios such as path migration, it is possible for there to be multiple active paths with different active connection IDs that could be used to retire each other. The exploit triggered an unintentional behaviour of a quiche design feature that supports retirement across paths while maintaining full connection ID synchronization, leading to an infinite loop.This issue affects quiche: from 0.15.0 before 0.24.5."	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

The directory is accessible with full read, write, and execute permissions for all users, allowing unprivileged users to manipulate files within the directory, including executable files like GPMAW3.exe, Fragment.exe, and the uninstaller GPsetup64_17028.exe. An attacker with user-level access can exploit this misconfiguration by replacing or modifying the uninstaller (GPsetup64_17028.exe) with a malicious version. While the application itself runs in the user's context, the uninstaller is typically executed with administrative privileges when an administrator attempts to uninstall the software. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker could gain administrative privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the admin, resulting in privilege escalation.	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2025-7195	2025-08-07T19:15:29.367	2025-08-08T20:15:26.950	"Early versions of Operator-SDK provided an insecure method to allow operator containers to run in environments that used a random UID. Operator-SDK before 0.15.2 provided a script, user_setup, which modifies the permissions of the /etc/passwd file to 664 during build time. Developers who used Operator-SDK before 0.15.2 to scaffold their operator may still be impacted by this if the insecure user_setup script is still being used to build new container images. 

In affected images, the /etc/passwd file is created during build time with group-writable permissions and a group ownership of root (gid=0). An attacker who can execute commands within an affected container, even as a non-root user, may be able to leverage their membership in the root group to modify the /etc/passwd file. This could allow the attacker to add a new user with any arbitrary UID, including UID 0, leading to full root privileges within the container."	5.2	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L

In versions 0.12.0 and below, the Card.get_model does not contain any logic to prevent arbitrary code execution. The Card.get_model function supports both joblib and skops for model loading. When loading .skops models, it uses skops' secure loading with trusted type validation, raising errors for untrusted types unless explicitly allowed. However, when non-.zip file formats are provided, the function silently falls back to joblib without warning. Unlike skops, joblib allows arbitrary code execution during loading, bypassing security measures and potentially enabling malicious code execution.

In versions below 4.6.1.dev138, the Assemblyline 4 Service Client (task_handler.py) accepts a SHA-256 value returned by the service server and uses it directly as a local file name.A malicious or compromised server (or any MITM that can speak to client) can return a path-traversal payload such as `../../../etc/cron.d/evil` and force the client to write the downloaded bytes to an arbitrary location on disk.

This fixes the tx timeout issue seen while running a stress test on
btnxpuart for couple of hours, such that the interval between two HCI
commands coincide with the power save timeout value of 2 seconds.

Test procedure using bash script:
<load btnxpuart.ko>
hciconfig hci0 up
//Enable Power Save feature
hcitool -i hci0 cmd 3f 23 02 00 00
while (true)
do
    hciconfig hci0 leadv
    sleep 2
    hciconfig hci0 noleadv
    sleep 2
done

Error log, after adding few more debug prints:
Bluetooth: btnxpuart_queue_skb(): 01 0A 20 01 00
Bluetooth: hci0: Set UART break: on, status=0
Bluetooth: hci0: btnxpuart_tx_wakeup() tx_work scheduled
Bluetooth: hci0: btnxpuart_tx_work() dequeue: 01 0A 20 01 00
Can't set advertise mode on hci0: Connection timed out (110)
Bluetooth: hci0: command 0x200a tx timeout

When the power save mechanism turns on UART break, and btnxpuart_tx_work()
is scheduled simultaneously, psdata->ps_state is read as PS_STATE_AWAKE,
which prevents the psdata->work from being scheduled, which is responsible
to turn OFF UART break.

This issue is fixed by adding a ps_lock mutex around UART break on/off as
well as around ps_state read/write.
btnxpuart_tx_wakeup() will now read updated ps_state value. If ps_state is
PS_STATE_SLEEP, it will first schedule psdata->work, and then it will
reschedule itself once UART break has been turned off and ps_state is
PS_STATE_AWAKE.

Tested above script for 50,000 iterations and TX timeout error was not
observed anymore."

CVE-2025-38499	2025-08-11T16:15:30.057	2025-08-28T15:15:51.383	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clone_private_mnt(): make sure that caller has CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the right userns

What we want is to verify there is that clone won't expose something
hidden by a mount we wouldn't be able to undo.  ""Wouldn't be able to undo""
may be a result of MNT_LOCKED on a child, but it may also come from
lacking admin rights in the userns of the namespace mount belongs to.

clone_private_mnt() checks the former, but not the latter.

There's a number of rather confusing CAP_SYS_ADMIN checks in various
userns during the mount, especially with the new mount API; they serve
different purposes and in case of clone_private_mnt() they usually,
but not always end up covering the missing check mentioned above."

A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in NASA CryptoLib version 1.4.0 and prior in the IV setup logic for telecommand frames. The problem arises from missing bounds checks when copying the Initialization Vector (IV) into a freshly allocated buffer. An attacker can supply a crafted TC frame that causes the library to write one byte past the end of the heap buffer, leading to heap corruption and undefined behaviour. An attacker supplying a malformed telecommand frame can corrupt heap memory. This leads to undefined behaviour, which could manifest itself as a crash (denial of service) or more severe exploitation.

xfrm: interface: fix use-after-free after changing collect_md xfrm interface

collect_md property on xfrm interfaces can only be set on device creation,
thus xfrmi_changelink() should fail when called on such interfaces.

The check to enforce this was done only in the case where the xi was
returned from xfrmi_locate() which doesn't look for the collect_md
interface, and thus the validation was never reached.

Calling changelink would thus errornously place the special interface xi
in the xfrmi_net->xfrmi hash, but since it also exists in the
xfrmi_net->collect_md_xfrmi pointer it would lead to a double free when
the net namespace was taken down [1].

Change the check to use the xi from netdev_priv which is available earlier
in the function to prevent changes in xfrm collect_md interfaces.

CVE-2025-50690	2025-08-13T15:15:34.883	2025-08-13T21:15:36.333	A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in SpatialReference.org (OSGeo/spatialreference.org) versions prior to 2025-05-17 (commit 2120adfa17ddd535bd0f539e6c4988fa3a2cb491). The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of user input in the search query parameter. An attacker can craft a specially formed URL with malicious JavaScript code, which is then reflected back and executed in the victim's browser. This flaw allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's session, potentially leading to session hijacking, phishing attacks, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites. The issue is exposed on publicly accessible pages, making it exploitable by an unauthenticated attacker.	6.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

CVE-2025-55196	2025-08-13T23:15:27.500	2025-08-14T13:11:53.633	External Secrets Operator is a Kubernetes operator that integrates external secret management systems. From version 0.15.0 to before 0.19.2, a vulnerability was discovered where the List() calls for Kubernetes Secret and SecretStore resources performed by the PushSecret controller did not apply a namespace selector. This flaw allowed an attacker to use label selectors to list and read secrets/secret-stores across the cluster, bypassing intended namespace restrictions. An attacker with the ability to create or update PushSecret resources and control SecretStore configurations could exploit this vulnerability to exfiltrate sensitive data from arbitrary namespaces. This could lead to full disclosure of Kubernetes secrets, including credentials, tokens, and other sensitive information stored in the cluster. This vulnerability has been patched in version 0.19.2. A workaround for this issue includes auditing and restricting RBAC permissions so that only trusted service accounts can create or update PushSecret and SecretStore resources.					
CVE-2025-55197	2025-08-13T23:15:27.660	2025-08-15T20:05:20.427	pypdf is a free and open-source pure-python PDF library.

CVE-2025-54472	2025-08-14T09:15:26.683	2025-08-18T18:35:46.417	"Unlimited memory allocation in redis protocol parser in Apache bRPC (all versions < 1.14.1) on all platforms allows attackers to crash the service via network.



Root Cause: In the bRPC Redis protocol parser code, memory for arrays or strings of corresponding sizes is allocated based on the integers read from the network. If the integer read from the network is too large, it may cause a bad alloc error and lead to the program crashing. Attackers can exploit this feature by sending special data packets to the bRPC service to carry out a denial-of-service attack on it.
The bRPC 1.14.0 version tried to fix this issue by limited the memory allocation size, however, the limitation checking code is not well implemented that may cause integer overflow and evade such limitation. So the 1.14.0 version is also vulnerable, although the integer range that affect version 1.14.0 is different from that affect version < 1.14.0.



Affected scenarios: Using bRPC as a Redis server to provide network services to untrusted clients, or using bRPC as a Redis client to call untrusted Redis services.



How to Fix: we provide two methods, you can choose one of them:

1. Upgrade bRPC to version 1.14.1.
2. Apply this patch ( https://github.com/apache/brpc/pull/3050 ) manually.

No matter you choose which method, you should note that the patch limits the maximum length of memory allocated for each time in the bRPC Redis parser. The default limit is 64M. If some of you redis request or response have a size larger than 64M, you might encounter error after upgrade. For such case, you can modify the gflag redis_max_allocation_size to set a larger limit."	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2025-55192	2025-08-14T17:15:41.173	2025-09-12T19:15:33.630	HomeAssistant-Tapo-Control offers Control for Tapo cameras as a Home Assistant component. Prior to commit 2a3b80f, there is a code injection vulnerability in the GitHub Actions workflow .github/workflows/issues.yml. It does not affect users of the Home Assistant integration itself — it only impacts the GitHub Actions environment for this repository. The vulnerable workflow directly inserted user-controlled content from the issue body (github.event.issue.body) into a Bash conditional without proper sanitization. A malicious GitHub user could craft an issue body that executes arbitrary commands on the GitHub Actions runner in a privileged context whenever an issue is opened. The potential impact is limited to the repository’s CI/CD environment, which could allow access to repository contents or GitHub Actions secrets. This issue has been patched via commit 2a3b80f. Workarounds involve disabling the affected workflow (issues.yml), replacing the unsafe Bash comparison with a safe quoted grep (or a pure GitHub Actions expression check), or ensuring minimal permissions in workflows (permissions: block) to reduce possible impact.

CVE-2025-55286	2025-08-16T01:15:27.567	2025-08-18T20:16:28.750	z2d is a pure Zig 2D graphics library. z2d v0.7.0 released with a new multi-sample anti-aliasing (MSAA) method, which uses a new buffering mechanism for storing coverage data. This differs from the standard alpha mask surface used for the previous super-sample anti-aliasing (SSAA) method. Under certain circumstances where the path being drawn existed in whole or partly outside of the rendering surface, incorrect bounding could cause out-of-bounds access within the coverage buffer. This affects the higher-level drawing operations, such as Context.fill, Context.stroke, painter.fill, and painter.stroke, when either the .default or .multisample_4x anti-aliasing modes were used. .supersample_4x was not affected, nor was drawing without anti-aliasing. In non-safe optimization modes (consumers compiling with ReleaseFast or ReleaseSmall), this could potentially lead to invalid memory accesses or corruption. z2d v0.7.1 fixes this issue, and it's recommended to upgrade to v0.7.1, or, given the small period of time v0.7.0 has been released, use v0.7.1 immediately, skipping v0.7.0.

bpf: Fix oob access in cgroup local storage

Lonial reported that an out-of-bounds access in cgroup local storage
can be crafted via tail calls. Given two programs each utilizing a
cgroup local storage with a different value size, and one program
doing a tail call into the other. The verifier will validate each of
the indivial programs just fine. However, in the runtime context
the bpf_cg_run_ctx holds an bpf_prog_array_item which contains the
BPF program as well as any cgroup local storage flavor the program
uses. Helpers such as bpf_get_local_storage() pick this up from the
runtime context:

  ctx = container_of(current->bpf_ctx, struct bpf_cg_run_ctx, run_ctx);
  storage = ctx->prog_item->cgroup_storage[stype];

  if (stype == BPF_CGROUP_STORAGE_SHARED)
    ptr = &READ_ONCE(storage->buf)->data[0];
  else
    ptr = this_cpu_ptr(storage->percpu_buf);

For the second program which was called from the originally attached
one, this means bpf_get_local_storage() will pick up the former
program's map, not its own. With mismatching sizes, this can result
in an unintended out-of-bounds access.

To fix this issue, we need to extend bpf_map_owner with an array of
storage_cookie[] to match on i) the exact maps from the original
program if the second program was using bpf_get_local_storage(), or
ii) allow the tail call combination if the second program was not
using any of the cgroup local storage maps."

This happens because we are processing an empty block group, which has
no extents allocated from it, there are no items for this block group,
including the block group item since block group items are stored in a
dedicated tree when using the block group tree feature. It also means
this is the block group with the highest start offset, so there are no
higher keys in the extent root, hence btrfs_search_slot_for_read()
returns 1 (no higher key found).

Fix this by asserting 'ret' is 0 only if the block group tree feature
is not enabled, in which case we should find a block group item for
the block group since it's stored in the extent root and block group
item keys are greater than extent item keys (the value for
BTRFS_BLOCK_GROUP_ITEM_KEY is 192 and for BTRFS_EXTENT_ITEM_KEY and
BTRFS_METADATA_ITEM_KEY the values are 168 and 169 respectively).
In case 'ret' is 1, we just need to add a record to the free space
tree which spans the whole block group, and we can achieve this by
making 'ret == 0' as the while loop's condition."

x86/sev: Use TSC_FACTOR for Secure TSC frequency calculation

When using Secure TSC, the GUEST_TSC_FREQ MSR reports a frequency based on
the nominal P0 frequency, which deviates slightly (typically ~0.2%) from
the actual mean TSC frequency due to clocking parameters.

Over extended VM uptime, this discrepancy accumulates, causing clock skew
between the hypervisor and a SEV-SNP VM, leading to early timer interrupts as
perceived by the guest.

The guest kernel relies on the reported nominal frequency for TSC-based
timekeeping, while the actual frequency set during SNP_LAUNCH_START may
differ. This mismatch results in inaccurate time calculations, causing the
guest to perceive hrtimers as firing earlier than expected.

Utilize the TSC_FACTOR from the SEV firmware's secrets page (see ""Secrets
Page Format"" in the SNP Firmware ABI Specification) to calculate the mean
TSC frequency, ensuring accurate timekeeping and mitigating clock skew in
SEV-SNP VMs.

Use early_ioremap_encrypted() to map the secrets page as
ioremap_encrypted() uses kmalloc() which is not available during early TSC
initialization and causes a panic.

wifi: prevent A-MSDU attacks in mesh networks

This patch is a mitigation to prevent the A-MSDU spoofing vulnerability
for mesh networks. The initial update to the IEEE 802.11 standard, in
response to the FragAttacks, missed this case (CVE-2025-27558). It can
be considered a variant of CVE-2020-24588 but for mesh networks.

This patch tries to detect if a standard MSDU was turned into an A-MSDU
by an adversary. This is done by parsing a received A-MSDU as a standard
MSDU, calculating the length of the Mesh Control header, and seeing if
the 6 bytes after this header equal the start of an rfc1042 header. If
equal, this is a strong indication of an ongoing attack attempt.

This defense was tested with mac80211_hwsim against a mesh network that
uses an empty Mesh Address Extension field, i.e., when four addresses
are used, and when using a 12-byte Mesh Address Extension field, i.e.,
when six addresses are used. Functionality of normal MSDUs and A-MSDUs
was also tested, and confirmed working, when using both an empty and
12-byte Mesh Address Extension field.

It was also tested with mac80211_hwsim that A-MSDU attacks in non-mesh
networks keep being detected and prevented.

Note that the vulnerability being patched, and the defense being
implemented, was also discussed in the following paper and in the
following IEEE 802.11 presentation:

As David Wang points out, this issue became easier to trigger after commit
780138b12381 (""alloc_tag: check mem_profiling_support in alloc_tag_init"").

Before the commit, the issue occurred only when it failed to allocate and
initialize alloc_tag_cttype or if a memory allocation fails before
alloc_tag_init() is called.  After the commit, it can be easily triggered
when memory profiling is compiled but disabled at boot.

To properly determine whether alloc_tag_init() has been called and its
data structures initialized, verify that alloc_tag_cttype is a valid
pointer before acquiring the semaphore.  If the variable is NULL or an
error value, it has not been properly initialized.  In such a case, just
skip and do not attempt to acquire the semaphore.

The issue occurs when umount has already released its reference to the
superblock. When _cifsFileInfo_put() calls cifs_sb_deactive(), this
releases the last reference, triggering the immediate cleanup of all
inodes under RCU. However, cifs_oplock_break() continues to access the
cinode after this point, resulting in use-after-free.

Fix this by holding an extra reference to the superblock during the
entire oplock break operation. This ensures that the superblock and
its inodes remain valid until the oplock break completes."

The nbpf->chan[] array is allocated earlier in the nbpf_probe() function

element farther than they should and corrupt memory.

The changes to the second loop are more involved.  In this case, we're
copying data from the irqbuf[] array into the nbpf->chan[] array.  If
the data in irqbuf[i] is the error IRQ then we skip it, so the iterators
are not in sync.  I added a check to ensure that we don't go beyond the
end of the irqbuf[] array.  I'm pretty sure this can't happen, but it
seemed harmless to add a check.

On the other hand, after the loop has ended there is a check to ensure
that the ""chan"" iterator is where we expect it to be.  In the original
code we went one element beyond the end of the array so the iterator
wasn't in the correct place and it would always return -EINVAL.  However,

rxrpc: Fix bug due to prealloc collision

When userspace is using AF_RXRPC to provide a server, it has to preallocate
incoming calls and assign to them call IDs that will be used to thread
related recvmsg() and sendmsg() together.  The preallocated call IDs will
automatically be attached to calls as they come in until the pool is empty.

To the kernel, the call IDs are just arbitrary numbers, but userspace can
use the call ID to hold a pointer to prepared structs.  In any case, the
user isn't permitted to create two calls with the same call ID (call IDs
become available again when the call ends) and EBADSLT should result from
sendmsg() if an attempt is made to preallocate a call with an in-use call
ID.

However, the cleanup in the error handling will trigger both assertions in
rxrpc_cleanup_call() because the call isn't marked complete and isn't
marked as having been released.

Fix this by setting the call state in rxrpc_service_prealloc_one() and then
marking it as being released before calling the cleanup function."

From 7.1.0 to before 9.9.1, Copier suggests that it's safe to generate a project from a safe template, i.e. one that doesn't use unsafe features like custom Jinja extensions which would require passing the --UNSAFE,--trust flag. As it turns out, a safe template can currently write files outside the destination path where a project shall be generated or updated. This is possible when rendering a generated directory structure whose rendered path is either a relative parent path or an absolute path. Constructing such paths is possible using Copier's builtin pathjoin Jinja filter and its builtin _copier_conf.sep variable, which is the platform-native path separator. This way, a malicious template author can create a template that overwrites arbitrary files (according to the user's write permissions), e.g., to cause havoc. This vulnerability is fixed in 9.9.1.

CVE-2025-38553	2025-08-19T06:15:33.407	2025-08-28T15:15:52.923	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: Restrict conditions for adding duplicating netems to qdisc tree

netem_enqueue's duplication prevention logic breaks when a netem
resides in a qdisc tree with other netems - this can lead to a
soft lockup and OOM loop in netem_dequeue, as seen in [1].
Ensure that a duplicating netem cannot exist in a tree with other
netems.

Previous approaches suggested in discussions in chronological order:

1) Track duplication status or ttl in the sk_buff struct. Considered
too specific a use case to extend such a struct, though this would
be a resilient fix and address other previous and potential future
DOS bugs like the one described in loopy fun [2].

2) Restrict netem_enqueue recursion depth like in act_mirred with a
per cpu variable. However, netem_dequeue can call enqueue on its
child, and the depth restriction could be bypassed if the child is a
netem.

3) Use the same approach as in 2, but add metadata in netem_skb_cb
to handle the netem_dequeue case and track a packet's involvement
in duplication. This is an overly complex approach, and Jamal
notes that the skb cb can be overwritten to circumvent this
safeguard.

4) Prevent the addition of a netem to a qdisc tree if its ancestral
path contains a netem. However, filters and actions can cause a
packet to change paths when re-enqueued to the root from netem
duplication, leading us to the current solution: prevent a
duplicating netem from inhabiting the same tree as other netems.

CVE-2025-38554	2025-08-19T17:15:31.510	2025-08-20T14:40:17.713	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: fix a UAF when vma->mm is freed after vma->vm_refcnt got dropped

By inducing delays in the right places, Jann Horn created a reproducer for
a hard to hit UAF issue that became possible after VMAs were allowed to be
recycled by adding SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU to their cache.

Race description is borrowed from Jann's discovery report:
lock_vma_under_rcu() looks up a VMA locklessly with mas_walk() under
rcu_read_lock().  At that point, the VMA may be concurrently freed, and it
can be recycled by another process.  vma_start_read() then increments the
vma->vm_refcnt (if it is in an acceptable range), and if this succeeds,
vma_start_read() can return a recycled VMA.

In this scenario where the VMA has been recycled, lock_vma_under_rcu()
will then detect the mismatching ->vm_mm pointer and drop the VMA through
vma_end_read(), which calls vma_refcount_put().  vma_refcount_put() drops
the refcount and then calls rcuwait_wake_up() using a copy of vma->vm_mm. 
This is wrong: It implicitly assumes that the caller is keeping the VMA's
mm alive, but in this scenario the caller has no relation to the VMA's mm,
so the rcuwait_wake_up() can cause UAF.

The diagram depicting the race:
T1         T2         T3
==         ==         ==
lock_vma_under_rcu
  mas_walk
          <VMA gets removed from mm>
                      mmap
                        <the same VMA is reallocated>
  vma_start_read
    __refcount_inc_not_zero_limited_acquire
                      munmap
                        __vma_enter_locked
                          refcount_add_not_zero
  vma_end_read
    vma_refcount_put
      __refcount_dec_and_test
                          rcuwait_wait_event
                            <finish operation>
      rcuwait_wake_up [UAF]

Note that rcuwait_wait_event() in T3 does not block because refcount was
already dropped by T1.  At this point T3 can exit and free the mm causing
UAF in T1.

To avoid this we move vma->vm_mm verification into vma_start_read() and
grab vma->vm_mm to stabilize it before vma_refcount_put() operation.

HID: apple: validate feature-report field count to prevent NULL pointer dereference

A malicious HID device with quirk APPLE_MAGIC_BACKLIGHT can trigger a NULL
pointer dereference whilst the power feature-report is toggled and sent to
the device in apple_magic_backlight_report_set(). The power feature-report
is expected to have two data fields, but if the descriptor declares one
field then accessing field[1] and dereferencing it in
apple_magic_backlight_report_set() becomes invalid
since field[1] will be NULL.

An example of a minimal descriptor which can cause the crash is something
like the following where the report with ID 3 (power report) only
references a single 1-byte field. When hid core parses the descriptor it
will encounter the final feature tag, allocate a hid_report (all members
of field[] will be zeroed out), create field structure and populate it,
increasing the maxfield to 1. The subsequent field[1] access and
dereference causes the crash.

usb: gadget: uvc: Initialize frame-based format color matching descriptor

Fix NULL pointer crash in uvcg_framebased_make due to uninitialized color
matching descriptor for frame-based format which was added in
commit f5e7bdd34aca (""usb: gadget: uvc: Allow creating new color matching
descriptors"") that added handling for uncompressed and mjpeg format.

Crash is seen when userspace configuration (via configfs) does not
explicitly define the color matching descriptor. If color_matching is not
found, config_group_find_item() returns NULL. The code then jumps to
out_put_cm, where it calls config_item_put(color_matching);. If
color_matching is NULL, this will dereference a null pointer, leading to a
crash.

perf/core: Prevent VMA split of buffer mappings

The perf mmap code is careful about mmap()'ing the user page with the
ringbuffer and additionally the auxiliary buffer, when the event supports
it. Once the first mapping is established, subsequent mapping have to use
the same offset and the same size in both cases. The reference counting for
the ringbuffer and the auxiliary buffer depends on this being correct.

Though perf does not prevent that a related mapping is split via mmap(2),
munmap(2) or mremap(2). A split of a VMA results in perf_mmap_open() calls,
which take reference counts, but then the subsequent perf_mmap_close()
calls are not longer fulfilling the offset and size checks. This leads to
reference count leaks.

As perf already has the requirement for subsequent mappings to match the
initial mapping, the obvious consequence is that VMA splits, caused by
resizing of a mapping or partial unmapping, have to be prevented.

Implement the vm_operations_struct::may_split() callback and return
unconditionally -EINVAL.

That ensures that the mapping offsets and sizes cannot be changed after the
fact. Remapping to a different fixed address with the same size is still
possible as it takes the references for the new mapping and drops those of
the old mapping."

perf/core: Handle buffer mapping fail correctly in perf_mmap()

After successful allocation of a buffer or a successful attachment to an
existing buffer perf_mmap() tries to map the buffer read only into the page
table. If that fails, the already set up page table entries are zapped, but
the other perf specific side effects of that failure are not handled.  The
calling code just cleans up the VMA and does not invoke perf_mmap_close().

This leaks reference counts, corrupts user->vm accounting and also results
in an unbalanced invocation of event::event_mapped().

Cure this by moving the event::event_mapped() invocation before the
map_range() call so that on map_range() failure perf_mmap_close() can be
invoked without causing an unbalanced event::event_unmapped() call.

perf_mmap_close() undoes the reference counts and eventually frees buffers."

perf/core: Exit early on perf_mmap() fail

When perf_mmap() fails to allocate a buffer, it still invokes the
event_mapped() callback of the related event. On X86 this might increase

perf_mmap_close() is never called in this case, which causes another
reference count leak.

sunrpc: fix handling of server side tls alerts

Scott Mayhew discovered a security exploit in NFS over TLS in
tls_alert_recv() due to its assumption it can read data from
the msg iterator's kvec..

kTLS implementation splits TLS non-data record payload between
the control message buffer (which includes the type such as TLS
aler or TLS cipher change) and the rest of the payload (say TLS
alert's level/description) which goes into the msg payload buffer.

This patch proposes to rework how control messages are setup and
used by sock_recvmsg().

If no control message structure is setup, kTLS layer will read and
process TLS data record types. As soon as it encounters a TLS control
message, it would return an error. At that point, NFS can setup a
kvec backed msg buffer and read in the control message such as a
TLS alert. Msg iterator can advance the kvec pointer as a part of
the copy process thus we need to revert the iterator before calling

powerpc/eeh: Make EEH driver device hotplug safe

Multiple race conditions existed between the PCIe hotplug driver and the
EEH driver, leading to a variety of kernel oopses of the same general
nature:

<pcie device unplug>
<eeh driver trigger>
<hotplug removal trigger>
<pcie tree reconfiguration>
<eeh recovery next step>
<oops in EEH driver bus iteration loop>

A second class of oops is also seen when the underlying bus disappears
during device recovery.

Refactor the EEH module to be PCI rescan and remove safe.  Also clean
up a few minor formatting / readability issues."

CVE-2025-38579	2025-08-19T17:15:35.020	2025-08-28T15:15:54.273	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix KMSAN uninit-value in extent_info usage

KMSAN reported a use of uninitialized value in `__is_extent_mergeable()`
 and `__is_back_mergeable()` via the read extent tree path.

The root cause is that `get_read_extent_info()` only initializes three
fields (`fofs`, `blk`, `len`) of `struct extent_info`, leaving the
remaining fields uninitialized. This leads to undefined behavior
when those fields are accessed later, especially during
extent merging.

Fix it by zero-initializing the `extent_info` struct before population."					
CVE-2025-38580	2025-08-19T17:15:35.160	2025-08-20T14:40:17.713	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix inode use after free in ext4_end_io_rsv_work()

In ext4_io_end_defer_completion(), check if io_end->list_vec is empty to
avoid adding an io_end that requires no conversion to the
i_rsv_conversion_list, which in turn prevents starting an unnecessary
worker. An ext4_emergency_state() check is also added to avoid attempting
to abort the journal in an emergency state.

Additionally, ext4_put_io_end_defer() is refactored to call
ext4_io_end_defer_completion() directly instead of being open-coded.
This also prevents starting an unnecessary worker when EXT4_IO_END_FAILED
is set but data_err=abort is not enabled.

This ensures that the check in ext4_put_io_end_defer() is consistent with
the check in ext4_end_bio(). Otherwise, we might add an io_end to the
i_rsv_conversion_list and then call ext4_finish_bio(), after which the
inode could be freed before ext4_end_io_rsv_work() is called, triggering
a use-after-free issue."

padata: Fix pd UAF once and for all

There is a race condition/UAF in padata_reorder that goes back
to the initial commit.  A reference count is taken at the start
of the process in padata_do_parallel, and released at the end in
padata_serial_worker.

This reference count is (and only is) required for padata_replace
to function correctly.  If padata_replace is never called then
there is no issue.

In the function padata_reorder which serves as the core of padata,
as soon as padata is added to queue->serial.list, and the associated
spin lock released, that padata may be processed and the reference
count on pd would go away.

Fix this by getting the next padata before the squeue->serial lock
is released.

In order to make this possible, simplify padata_reorder by only
calling it once the next padata arrives."

staging: media: atomisp: Fix stack buffer overflow in gmin_get_var_int()

When gmin_get_config_var() calls efi.get_variable() and the EFI variable
is larger than the expected buffer size, two behaviors combine to create
a stack buffer overflow:

1. gmin_get_config_var() does not return the proper error code when
   efi.get_variable() fails. It returns the stale 'ret' value from
   earlier operations instead of indicating the EFI failure.

2. When efi.get_variable() returns EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL, it updates
   *out_len to the required buffer size but writes no data to the output
   buffer. However, due to bug #1, gmin_get_var_int() believes the call
   succeeded.

The caller gmin_get_var_int() then performs:
- Allocates val[CFG_VAR_NAME_MAX + 1] (65 bytes) on stack
- Calls gmin_get_config_var(dev, is_gmin, var, val, &len) with len=64
- If EFI variable is >64 bytes, efi.get_variable() sets len=required_size
- Due to bug #1, thinks call succeeded with len=required_size
- Executes val[len] = 0, writing past end of 65-byte stack buffer

This creates a stack buffer overflow when EFI variables are larger than
64 bytes. Since EFI variables can be controlled by firmware or system
configuration, this could potentially be exploited for code execution.

Fix the bug by returning proper error codes from gmin_get_config_var()
based on EFI status instead of stale 'ret' value.

The gmin_get_var_int() function is called during device initialization
for camera sensor configuration on Intel Bay Trail and Cherry Trail
platforms using the atomisp camera stack."

bpf, arm64: Fix fp initialization for exception boundary

In the ARM64 BPF JIT when prog->aux->exception_boundary is set for a BPF
program, find_used_callee_regs() is not called because for a program
acting as exception boundary, all callee saved registers are saved.
find_used_callee_regs() sets `ctx->fp_used = true;` when it sees FP
being used in any of the instructions.

For programs acting as exception boundary, ctx->fp_used remains false
even if frame pointer is used by the program and therefore, FP is not
set-up for such programs in the prologue. This can cause the kernel to
crash due to a pagefault.

Fix it by setting ctx->fp_used = true for exception boundary programs as

neighbour: Fix null-ptr-deref in neigh_flush_dev().

kernel test robot reported null-ptr-deref in neigh_flush_dev(). [0]

The cited commit introduced per-netdev neighbour list and converted
neigh_flush_dev() to use it instead of the global hash table.

One thing we missed is that neigh_table_clear() calls neigh_ifdown()
with NULL dev.

Let's restore the hash table iteration.

Note that IPv6 module is no longer unloadable, so neigh_table_clear()
is called only when IPv6 fails to initialise, which is unlikely to
happen.

net/mlx5e: Remove skb secpath if xfrm state is not found

Hardware returns a unique identifier for a decrypted packet's xfrm
state, this state is looked up in an xarray. However, the state might
have been freed by the time of this lookup.

Currently, if the state is not found, only a counter is incremented.
The secpath (sp) extension on the skb is not removed, resulting in
sp->len becoming 0.

Subsequently, functions like __xfrm_policy_check() attempt to access
fields such as xfrm_input_state(skb)->xso.type (which dereferences
sp->xvec[sp->len - 1]) without first validating sp->len. This leads to
a crash when dereferencing an invalid state pointer.

This patch prevents the crash by explicitly removing the secpath
extension from the skb if the xfrm state is not found after hardware
decryption. This ensures downstream functions do not operate on a
zero-length secpath.

The following BPF program, simplified from a syzkaller repro, causes a
kernel warning:

    exit;

With pointer field sk being at offset 168 in __sk_buff. This access is
detected as a narrower read in bpf_skb_is_valid_access because it
doesn't match offsetof(struct __sk_buff, sk). It is therefore allowed
and later proceeds to bpf_convert_ctx_access. Note that for the
""is_narrower_load"" case in the convert_ctx_accesses(), the insn->off
is aligned, so the cnt may not be 0 because it matches the
offsetof(struct __sk_buff, sk) in the bpf_convert_ctx_access. However,
the target_size stays 0 and the verifier errors with a kernel warning:

This patch fixes that to return a proper ""invalid bpf_context access
off=X size=Y"" error on the load instruction.

The same issue affects multiple other fields in context structures that
allow narrow access. Some other non-affected fields (for sk_msg,
sk_lookup, and sockopt) were also changed to use bpf_ctx_range_ptr for
consistency.

Note this syzkaller crash was reported in the ""Closes"" link below, which
used to be about a different bug, fixed in

iommu/vt-d: Fix UAF on sva unbind with pending IOPFs

Commit 17fce9d2336d (""iommu/vt-d: Put iopf enablement in domain attach
path"") disables IOPF on device by removing the device from its IOMMU's
IOPF queue when the last IOPF-capable domain is detached from the device.
Unfortunately, it did this in a wrong place where there are still pending
IOPFs. As a result, a use-after-free error is potentially triggered and
eventually a kernel panic with a kernel trace similar to the following:

xen: fix UAF in dmabuf_exp_from_pages()

[dma_buf_fd() fixes; no preferences regarding the tree it goes through -
up to xen folks]

As soon as we'd inserted a file reference into descriptor table, another
thread could close it.  That's fine for the case when all we are doing is
returning that descriptor to userland (it's a race, but it's a userland
race and there's nothing the kernel can do about it).  However, if we
follow fd_install() with any kind of access to objects that would be
destroyed on close (be it the struct file itself or anything destroyed
by its ->release()), we have a UAF.

dma_buf_fd() is a combination of reserving a descriptor and fd_install().
gntdev dmabuf_exp_from_pages() calls it and then proceeds to access the
objects destroyed on close - starting with gntdev_dmabuf itself.

Fix that by doing reserving descriptor before anything else and do
fd_install() only when everything had been set up."

drm/panthor: Fix UAF in panthor_gem_create_with_handle() debugfs code

The object is potentially already gone after the drm_gem_object_put().
In general the object should be fully constructed before calling
drm_gem_handle_create(), except the debugfs tracking uses a separate
lock and list and separate flag to denotate whether the object is
actually initialized.

Since I'm touching this all anyway simplify this by only adding the
object to the debugfs when it's ready for that, which allows us to
delete that separate flag. panthor_gem_debugfs_bo_rm() already checks
whether we've actually been added to the list or this is some error
path cleanup.

drm/rockchip: vop2: fail cleanly if missing a primary plane for a video-port

Each window of a vop2 is usable by a specific set of video ports, so while
binding the vop2, we look through the list of available windows trying to
find one designated as primary-plane and usable by that specific port.

The code later wants to use drm_crtc_init_with_planes with that found
primary plane, but nothing has checked so far if a primary plane was
actually found.

For whatever reason, the rk3576 vp2 does not have a usable primary window
(if vp0 is also in use) which brought the issue to light and ended in a
null-pointer dereference further down.

As we expect a primary-plane to exist for a video-port, add a check at
the end of the window-iteration and fail probing if none was found."

2) At this point reconfiguration fails (we have 2 resets) and
  ath11k_core_reconfigure_on_crash() calls ath11k_hal_srng_deinit()

CVE-2025-38606	2025-08-19T17:15:38.930	2025-08-20T14:40:17.713	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: Avoid accessing uninitialized arvif->ar during beacon miss

During beacon miss handling, ath12k driver iterates over active virtual
interfaces (vifs) and attempts to access the radio object (ar) via
arvif->deflink->ar.

However, after commit aa80f12f3bed (""wifi: ath12k: defer vdev creation for
MLO""), arvif is linked to a radio only after vdev creation, typically when
a channel is assigned or a scan is requested.
For P2P capable devices, a default P2P interface is created by
wpa_supplicant along with regular station interfaces, these serve as dummy
interfaces for P2P-capable stations, lack an associated netdev and initiate
frequent scans to discover neighbor p2p devices. When a scan is initiated
on such P2P vifs, driver selects destination radio (ar) based on scan
frequency, creates a scan vdev, and attaches arvif to the radio. Once the
scan completes or is aborted, the scan vdev is deleted, detaching arvif
from the radio and leaving arvif->ar uninitialized.

While handling beacon miss for station interfaces, P2P interface is also
encountered in the vif iteration and ath12k_mac_handle_beacon_miss_iter()
tries to dereference the uninitialized arvif->deflink->ar.

Fix this by verifying that vdev is created for the arvif before accessing
its ar during beacon miss handling and similar vif iterator callbacks.

CVE-2025-38614	2025-08-19T17:15:40.040	2025-08-28T15:15:55.647	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

eventpoll: Fix semi-unbounded recursion

Ensure that epoll instances can never form a graph deeper than
EP_MAX_NESTS+1 links.

Currently, ep_loop_check_proc() ensures that the graph is loop-free and
does some recursion depth checks, but those recursion depth checks don't
limit the depth of the resulting tree for two reasons:

 - They don't look upwards in the tree.
 - If there are multiple downwards paths of different lengths, only one of
   the paths is actually considered for the depth check since commit
   28d82dc1c4ed (""epoll: limit paths"").

Essentially, the current recursion depth check in ep_loop_check_proc() just
serves to prevent it from recursing too deeply while checking for loops.

A more thorough check is done in reverse_path_check() after the new graph
edge has already been created; this checks, among other things, that no
paths going upwards from any non-epoll file with a length of more than 5
edges exist. However, this check does not apply to non-epoll files.

As a result, it is possible to recurse to a depth of at least roughly 500,
tested on v6.15. (I am unsure if deeper recursion is possible; and this may
have changed with commit 8c44dac8add7 (""eventpoll: Fix priority inversion
problem"").)

To fix it:

1. In ep_loop_check_proc(), note the subtree depth of each visited node,
and use subtree depths for the total depth calculation even when a subtree
has already been visited.
2. Add ep_get_upwards_depth_proc() for similarly determining the maximum
depth of an upwards walk.
3. In ep_loop_check(), use these values to limit the total path length
between epoll nodes to EP_MAX_NESTS edges."

CVE-2025-8289	2025-08-20T03:15:36.040	2025-08-20T14:39:07.860	The Redirection for Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.4 via deserialization of untrusted input in the delete_associated_files function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. This vulnerability may be exploited by unauthenticated attackers when a form is present on the site with a file upload action, and doesn't affect sites with PHP version > 8. This vulnerability also requires the 'Redirection For Contact Form 7 Extension - Create Post' extension to be installed and activated in order to be exploited. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present. We confirmed there is a usable gadget in Contact Form 7 plugin that makes arbitrary file deletion possible when installed with this plugin. Given Contact Form 7 is a requirement of this plugin, it is likely that any site with this plugin and the 'Redirection For Contact Form 7 Extension - Create Post' extension enabled is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

For example, a client can open a stream and then send WINDOW_UPDATE frames with window size increment of 0, which is illegal.
Per specification  https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113.html#name-window_update , the server should send a RST_STREAM frame.
The client can now open another stream and send another bad WINDOW_UPDATE, therefore causing the server to consume more resources than necessary, as this case does not exceed the max number of concurrent streams, yet the client is able to create an enormous amount of streams in a short period of time.


The attack can be performed with other conditions (for example, a DATA frame for a closed stream) that cause the server to send a RST_STREAM frame.

From 1.8.0 to before 1.8.3, a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Planned Hours field when creating a new project. When sending a POST request to /issues/new/, the value provided in the Planned Hours field is included in the server response without any HTML encoding or sanitization. Because of this, an attacker can craft a malicious payload such as <script>alert(1)</script> and include it in the planned_hours parameter. The server reflects the input directly in the HTML of the project creation page, causing the browser to interpret and execute it. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.8.3.

tls: handle data disappearing from under the TLS ULP

TLS expects that it owns the receive queue of the TCP socket.
This cannot be guaranteed in case the reader of the TCP socket
entered before the TLS ULP was installed, or uses some non-standard
read API (eg. zerocopy ones). Replace the WARN_ON() and a buggy
early exit (which leaves anchor pointing to a freed skb) with real
error handling. Wipe the parsing state and tell the reader to retry.

We already reload the anchor every time we (re)acquire the socket lock,
so the only condition we need to avoid is an out of bounds read
(not having enough bytes in the socket for previously parsed record len).

If some data was read from under TLS but there's enough in the queue
we'll reload and decrypt what is most likely not a valid TLS record.
Leading to some undefined behavior from TLS perspective (corrupting
a stream? missing an alert? missing an attack?) but no kernel crash
should take place."

There too the packet_notifier NETDEV_UP event managed to run while a

the fix was similarly to temporarily set po->num to zero to keep

zloop: fix KASAN use-after-free of tag set

When a zoned loop device, or zloop device, is removed, KASAN enabled
kernel reports ""BUG KASAN use-after-free"" in blk_mq_free_tag_set(). The
BUG happens because zloop_ctl_remove() calls put_disk(), which invokes
zloop_free_disk(). The zloop_free_disk() frees the memory allocated for
the zlo pointer. However, after the memory is freed, zloop_ctl_remove()
calls blk_mq_free_tag_set(&zlo->tag_set), which accesses the freed zlo.
Hence the KASAN use-after-free.

 zloop_ctl_remove()
  put_disk(zlo->disk)
   put_device()
    kobject_put()
     ...
      zloop_free_disk()
        kvfree(zlo)
  blk_mq_free_tag_set(&zlo->tag_set)

To avoid the BUG, move the call to blk_mq_free_tag_set(&zlo->tag_set)
from zloop_ctl_remove() into zloop_free_disk(). This ensures that
the tag_set is freed before the call to kvfree(zlo)."

PCI: pnv_php: Fix surprise plug detection and recovery

The existing PowerNV hotplug code did not handle surprise plug events
correctly, leading to a complete failure of the hotplug system after device
removal and a required reboot to detect new devices.

This comes down to two issues:

 1) When a device is surprise removed, often the bridge upstream
    port will cause a PE freeze on the PHB.  If this freeze is not
    cleared, the MSI interrupts from the bridge hotplug notification
    logic will not be received by the kernel, stalling all plug events
    on all slots associated with the PE.

 2) When a device is removed from a slot, regardless of surprise or
    programmatic removal, the associated PHB/PE ls left frozen.
    If this freeze is not cleared via a fundamental reset, skiboot
    is unable to clear the freeze and cannot retrain / rescan the
    slot.  This also requires a reboot to clear the freeze and redetect
    the device in the slot.

Issue the appropriate unfreeze and rescan commands on hotplug events,
and don't oops on hotplug if pci_bus_to_OF_node() returns NULL.

PCI: pnv_php: Clean up allocated IRQs on unplug

When the root of a nested PCIe bridge configuration is unplugged, the
pnv_php driver leaked the allocated IRQ resources for the child bridges'
hotplug event notifications, resulting in a panic.

Fix this by walking all child buses and deallocating all its IRQ resources
before calling pci_hp_remove_devices().

Also modify the lifetime of the workqueue at struct pnv_php_slot::wq so
that it is only destroyed in pnv_php_free_slot(), instead of
pnv_php_disable_irq(). This is required since pnv_php_disable_irq() will
now be called by workers triggered by hot unplug interrupts, so the
workqueue needs to stay allocated.

vdpa/mlx5: Fix release of uninitialized resources on error path

The commit in the fixes tag made sure that mlx5_vdpa_free()
is the single entrypoint for removing the vdpa device resources
added in mlx5_vdpa_dev_add(), even in the cleanup path of
mlx5_vdpa_dev_add().

This means that all functions from mlx5_vdpa_free() should be able to
handle uninitialized resources. This was not the case though:
mlx5_vdpa_destroy_mr_resources() and mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx()
were not able to do so. This caused the splat below when adding
a vdpa device without a MAC address.

This patch fixes these remaining issues:

- Makes mlx5_vdpa_destroy_mr_resources() return early if called on
  uninitialized resources.

- Moves mlx5_cmd_init_async_ctx() early on during device addition
  because it can't fail. This means that mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx()
  also can't fail. To mirror this, move the call site of
  mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx() in mlx5_vdpa_free().

An additional comment was added in mlx5_vdpa_free() to document
the expectations of functions called from this context.

CVE-2025-38632	2025-08-22T16:15:37.033	2025-08-22T18:08:51.663	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pinmux: fix race causing mux_owner NULL with active mux_usecount

commit 5a3e85c3c397 (""pinmux: Use sequential access to access
desc->pinmux data"") tried to address the issue when two client of the
same gpio calls pinctrl_select_state() for the same functionality, was
resulting in NULL pointer issue while accessing desc->mux_owner.
However, issue was not completely fixed due to the way it was handled
and it can still result in the same NULL pointer.

The issue occurs due to the following interleaving:

     cpu0 (process A)                   cpu1 (process B)

      pin_request() {                   pin_free() {

                                         mutex_lock()
                                         desc->mux_usecount--; //becomes 0
                                         ..
                                         mutex_unlock()

  mutex_lock(desc->mux)
  desc->mux_usecount++; // becomes 1
  desc->mux_owner = owner;
  mutex_unlock(desc->mux)

                                         mutex_lock(desc->mux)
                                         desc->mux_owner = NULL;
                                         mutex_unlock(desc->mux)

This sequence leads to a state where the pin appears to be in use
(`mux_usecount == 1`) but has no owner (`mux_owner == NULL`), which can
cause NULL pointer on next pin_request on the same pin.

Ensure that updates to mux_usecount and mux_owner are performed
atomically under the same lock. Only clear mux_owner when mux_usecount
reaches zero and no new owner has been assigned."

clk: spacemit: mark K1 pll1_d8 as critical

The pll1_d8 clock is enabled by the boot loader, and is ultimately a
parent for numerous clocks, including those used by APB and AXI buses.
Guodong Xu discovered that this clock got disabled while responding to
getting -EPROBE_DEFER when requesting a reset controller.

The needed clock (CLK_DMA, along with its parents) had already been
enabled.  To respond to the probe deferral return, the CLK_DMA clock
was disabled, and this led to parent clocks also reducing their enable
count.  When the enable count for pll1_d8 was decremented it became 0,
which caused it to be disabled.  This led to a system hang.

Marking that clock critical resolves this by preventing it from being
disabled.

Define a new macro CCU_FACTOR_GATE_DEFINE() to allow clock flags to
be supplied for a CCU_FACTOR_GATE clock."

reading 32 bytes ends up in out of bound memory accesses (e.g. the next
automaton's data in this case).
The error is harmless as, while printing the string, we stop at the null

reading out of bound memory."

nvmet: pci-epf: Do not complete commands twice if nvmet_req_init() fails

Have nvmet_req_init() and req->execute() complete failed commands.

Description of the problem:
nvmet_req_init() calls __nvmet_req_complete() internally upon failure,
e.g., unsupported opcode, which calls the ""queue_response"" callback,
this results in nvmet_pci_epf_queue_response() being called, which will
call nvmet_pci_epf_complete_iod() if data_len is 0 or if dma_dir is
different from DMA_TO_DEVICE. This results in a double completion as
nvmet_pci_epf_exec_iod_work() also calls nvmet_pci_epf_complete_iod()
when nvmet_req_init() fails.

Steps to reproduce:
On the host send a command with an unsupported opcode with nvme-cli,
For example the admin command ""security receive""
$ sudo nvme security-recv /dev/nvme0n1 -n1 -x4096

This triggers a double completion as nvmet_req_init() fails and
nvmet_pci_epf_queue_response() is called, here iod->dma_dir is still
in the default state of ""DMA_NONE"" as set by default in
nvmet_pci_epf_alloc_iod(), so nvmet_pci_epf_complete_iod() is called.
Because nvmet_req_init() failed nvmet_pci_epf_complete_iod() is also
called in nvmet_pci_epf_exec_iod_work() leading to a double completion.
This not only sends two completions to the host but also corrupts the
state of the PCI NVMe target leading to kernel oops.

This patch lets nvmet_req_init() and req->execute() complete all failed
commands, and removes the double completion case in
nvmet_pci_epf_exec_iod_work() therefore fixing the edge cases where
double completions occurred."

arm64/entry: Mask DAIF in cpu_switch_to(), call_on_irq_stack()

`cpu_switch_to()` and `call_on_irq_stack()` manipulate SP to change
to different stacks along with the Shadow Call Stack if it is enabled.
Those two stack changes cannot be done atomically and both functions
can be interrupted by SErrors or Debug Exceptions which, though unlikely,
is very much broken : if interrupted, we can end up with mismatched stacks
and Shadow Call Stack leading to clobbered stacks.

In `cpu_switch_to()`, it can happen when SP_EL0 points to the new task,
but x18 stills points to the old task's SCS. When the interrupt handler
tries to save the task's SCS pointer, it will save the old task
SCS pointer (x18) into the new task struct (pointed to by SP_EL0),
clobbering it.

In `call_on_irq_stack()`, it can happen when switching from the task stack
to the IRQ stack and when switching back. In both cases, we can be
interrupted when the SCS pointer points to the IRQ SCS, but SP points to
the task stack. The nested interrupt handler pushes its return addresses
on the IRQ SCS. It then detects that SP points to the task stack,
calls `call_on_irq_stack()` and clobbers the task SCS pointer with
the IRQ SCS pointer, which it will also use !

This leads to tasks returning to addresses on the wrong SCS,
or even on the IRQ SCS, triggering kernel panics via CONFIG_VMAP_STACK
or FPAC if enabled.

This is possible on a default config, but unlikely.
However, when enabling CONFIG_ARM64_PSEUDO_NMI, DAIF is unmasked and
instead the GIC is responsible for filtering what interrupts the CPU
should receive based on priority.
Given the goal of emulating NMIs, pseudo-NMIs can be received by the CPU
even in `cpu_switch_to()` and `call_on_irq_stack()`, possibly *very*
frequently depending on the system configuration and workload, leading
to unpredictable kernel panics.

Completely mask DAIF in `cpu_switch_to()` and restore it when returning.
Do the same in `call_on_irq_stack()`, but restore and mask around
the branch.
Mask DAIF even if CONFIG_SHADOW_CALL_STACK is not enabled for consistency
of behaviour between all configurations.

Introduce and use an assembly macro for saving and masking DAIF,

The vulnerability occurs because user-influenced HTML from AI responses is rendered in an iframe with 'allow-scripts' sandbox permission without proper sanitization. This can be exploited through specifically crafted prompts that cause the AI to generate malicious HTML/JavaScript code. When a user views the HTML preview, the injected JavaScript executes in the user's browser context, potentially allowing attackers to exfiltrate sensitive information (including API keys stored in localStorage), perform actions on behalf of the user, and steal session data.	6.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

Versions 4.0.0 to 4.0.2, 3.0.0 to 3.3.6, and all versions prior to 2.71.15 are vulnerable to a username enumeration issue in the login interface. The login UI includes a security feature, Ignoring unknown usernames, that is intended to prevent username enumeration by returning a generic response for both valid and invalid usernames. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to bypass this protection by submitting arbitrary userIDs to the select account page and distinguishing between valid and invalid accounts based on the system's response. For effective exploitation, an attacker needs to iterate through possible userIDs, but the impact can be limited by implementing rate limiting or similar measures.

In versions 2.6.0 through 2.26.3, the application does not properly restrict redirect callback URLs during OIDC authentication. An attacker can craft a login link that causes Audiobookshelf to store an arbitrary callback in a cookie, which is later used to redirect the user after authentication. The server then issues a 302 redirect to the attacker-controlled URL, appending sensitive OIDC tokens as query parameters. This allows an attacker to obtain the victim's tokens and perform full account takeover, including creating persistent admin users if the victim is an administrator. Tokens are further leaked via browser history, Referer headers, and server logs. This vulnerability impacts all Audiobookshelf deployments using OIDC; no IdP misconfiguration is required.

Prior to versions 6.9.13-28 and 7.1.2-2 for ImageMagick's 32-bit build, a 32-bit integer overflow in the BMP encoder’s scanline-stride computation collapses bytes_per_line (stride) to a tiny value while the per-row writer still emits 3 × width bytes for 24-bpp images. The row base pointer advances using the (overflowed) stride, so the first row immediately writes past its slot and into adjacent heap memory with attacker-controlled bytes. This is a classic, powerful primitive for heap corruption in common auto-convert pipelines.

This is achieved via the loop device handler, which handles requests sent through the D-BUS interface. As two of the parameters of this handle, it receives the file descriptor list and index specifying the file where the loop device should be backed. The function itself validates the index value to ensure it isn't bigger than the maximum value allowed. However, it fails to validate the lower bound, allowing the index parameter to be a negative value. Under these circumstances, an attacker can cause the UDisks daemon to crash or perform a local privilege escalation by gaining access to files owned by privileged users.	8.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:H

This vulnerability is a confirmed HTTP response splitting flaw in CGI::Simple that allows HTTP response header injection, which can be used for reflected XSS or open redirect under certain conditions.

Although some validation exists, it can be bypassed using URL-encoded values, allowing an attacker to inject untrusted content into the response via query parameters.



As a result, an attacker can inject a line break (e.g. %0A) into the parameter value, causing the server to split the HTTP response and inject arbitrary headers or even an HTML/JavaScript body, leading to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS), open redirect or other attacks.

The issue documented in CVE-2010-4410 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-4410 is related but the fix was incomplete.

Impact

By injecting %0A (newline) into a query string parameter, an attacker can:

  *  Break the current HTTP header
  *  Inject a new header or entire body
  *  Deliver a script payload that is reflected in the server’s response
That can lead to the following attacks:

  *  reflected XSS
  *  open redirect
  *  cache poisoning
  *  header manipulation"	7.3	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

After the CVE-2025-24358 fix, a network attacker that places a form at http://example.com can't get it to submit to https://example.com because the Origin header is checked with sameOrigin against a synthetic URL. However, if a host is added to TrustedOrigins, both its HTTP and HTTPS origins will be allowed, because the schema of the synthetic URL is ignored and only the host is checked. For example, if an application is hosted on https://example.com and adds example.net to TrustedOrigins, a network attacker can serve a form at http://example.net to perform the attack. Applications should migrate to net/http.CrossOriginProtection, introduced in Go 1.25.

The root cause is in the corrupted image, there is a dnode has the same
node id w/ its inode, so during f2fs_get_dnode_of_data(), it tries to
access block address in dnode at offset 934, however it parses the dnode
as inode node, so that get_dnode_addr() returns 360, then it tries to
access page address from 360 + 934 * 4 = 4096 w/ 4 bytes.

To fix this issue, let's add sanity check for node id of all direct nodes
during f2fs_get_dnode_of_data()."
