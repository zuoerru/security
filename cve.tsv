A vulnerability was discovered in the BeyondTrust provider implementation for External Secrets Operator versions 0.10.1 through 0.19.2. The provider previously retrieved Kubernetes secrets directly, without validating the namespace context or the type of secret store. This allowed unauthorized cross-namespace secret access, violating security boundaries and potentially exposing sensitive credentials. In version 0.20.0, the provider code was updated to use the `resolvers.SecretKeyRef` utility, which enforces namespace validation and only allows cross-namespace access for `ClusterSecretStore` types. This ensures secrets are only retrieved from the correct namespace, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access. All users should upgrade to the latest version containing this fix. As a workaround, use a policy engine such as Kyverno or OPA to prevent using BeyondTrust provider and/or validate the `(Cluster)SecretStore` and ensure the namespace may only be set when using a `ClusterSecretStore`.										0.00049	2025-10-11 23:26:20	0.14881	1			1	1	1	8.7			8.7	2025-10-10 22:35:29	0.0	0.0													1					External Secrets Operator's BeyondTrust Provider has Insecure Secret Retrieval

In versions prior to 1.3.26, unauthenticated attackers can create or modify API keys for any user by passing that user's id in the request body to the `api/auth/api-key/create` route. `session?.user ?? (authRequired ? null : { id: ctx.body.userId })`. When no session exists but `userId` is present in the request body, `authRequired` becomes false and the user object is set to the attacker-controlled ID. Server-only field validation only executes when `authRequired` is true (lines 280-295), allowing attackers to set privileged fields. No additional authentication occurs before the database operation, so the malicious payload is accepted. The same pattern exists in the update endpoint. This is a critical authentication bypass enabling full an unauthenticated attacker can generate an API key for any user and immediately gain complete authenticated access.

Astro will then return the malicious value. This could result in any usages of the `Astro.url` value in code being manipulated by a request. For example if a user follows guidance and uses `Astro.url` for a canonical link the canonical link can be manipulated to another site. It is theoretically possible that the value could also be used as a login/registration or other form URL as well, resulting in potential redirecting of login credentials to a malicious party. As this is a per-request attack vector the surface area would only be to the malicious user until one considers that having a caching proxy is a common setup, in which case any page which is cached could persist the malicious value for subsequent users. Many other frameworks have an allowlist of domains to validate against, or do not have a case where the headers are reflected to avoid such issues. This could affect anyone using Astro in an on-demand/dynamic rendering mode behind a caching proxy. Version 5.14.2 contains a fix for the issue.										0.00042	2025-10-11 23:26:20	0.12408	1			2	1	1	6.5				2025-10-10 20:33:26	3.9	2.5																		Astro's `X-Forwarded-Host` is reflected with no validation

In versions prior to 4.2.0, there is a denial of service vulnerability in the `If-Match` and `If-None-Match` header parsing component of Sinatra, if the `etag` method is used when constructing the response. Carefully crafted input can cause `If-Match` and `If-None-Match` header parsing in Sinatra to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a denial of service attack vector. This header is typically involved in generating the `ETag` header value. Any applications that use the `etag` method when generating a response are impacted.

In versions prior to 3.4.5, the sanitization method `ldap.filter.escape_filter_chars` can be tricked to skip escaping of special characters when a crafted `list` or `dict` is supplied as the `assertion_value` parameter, and the non-default `escape_mode=1` is configured. The method `ldap.filter.escape_filter_chars` supports 3 different escaping modes. `escape_mode=0` (default) and `escape_mode=2` happen to raise exceptions when a `list` or `dict` object is supplied as the `assertion_value` parameter. However, `escape_mode=1` computes without performing adequate logic to ensure a fully escaped return value. If an application relies on the vulnerable method in the `python-ldap` library to escape untrusted user input, an attacker might be able to abuse the vulnerability to launch ldap injection attacks which could potentially disclose or manipulate ldap data meant to be inaccessible to them.

A BPv7 bundle with a malformed extension block causes uncontrolled memory allocation inside ION-DTN 4.1.3s, leading to receiver thread termination and a Denial-of-Service (DoS). The triggering bundle contains an extension block starting at `0x85070201005bbb0e20b4ea001a000927c0...`. The first byte in the extension block (0x85) indicates a CBOR array of five elements of which the first four are numbers (0x07, 0x02, 0x01, 0x00) but the fifth element is a byte string of length 27 (`0x5bbb0e20b4ea001a000927c0...`). The vulnerability seems to be due to processing the fifth element of the array (i.e., the byte string) as replacing it with a number makes the vulnerability no longer be triggered. While parsing this extension block, ION obtains a very large block length, which in the code in `bei.c`:764) seems to be passed from `blockLength` which is an unsigned int, to a 32 bit signed integer `blkSize`. The unsigned to signed conversion causes `blkSize` to hold the value of -369092043, which is then converted into a 64-bit unsigned value inside `MTAKE(blkSize)`, resulting in an attempt to allocate an unrealistic amount of memory, causing the error.

This may lead to users accidentally publishing media not meant for publishing, and thus possibly exposing internal media. This risk of this actually impacting someone is very low, though. This can only be triggered by users with write access to an event. They also have to use the editor, which is usually an action taken if they want to publish media and not something users would use on internal media they do not want to publish. Finally, they have to first click on \"Save & Publish\" before then selecting the \"Save\" option. Nevertheless, while very unlikely, this can happen.

Prior to version 0.9.4, a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the chat API allows any authenticated user to force the server to make arbitrary HTTP requests to internal and external networks. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive internal services, reconnaissance of the internal network, or interaction with third-party services. The same mechanism also allows for a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, enabling users to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. The vulnerability exists in the `_process_request` function within `src/llamafactory/api/chat.py.` This function is responsible for processing incoming multimodal content, including images, videos, and audio provided via URLs. The function checks if the provided URL is a base64 data URI or a local file path (`os.path.isfile`). If neither is true, it falls back to treating the URL as a web URI and makes a direct HTTP GET request using `requests.get(url, stream=True).raw` without any validation or sanitization of the URL.

Prior to versions 2.2.20, 3.1.18, and 3.2.3, a possible information disclosure vulnerability existed in `Rack::Sendfile` when running behind a proxy that supports `x-sendfile` headers (such as Nginx). Specially crafted headers could cause `Rack::Sendfile` to miscommunicate with the proxy and trigger unintended internal requests, potentially bypassing proxy-level access restrictions. When `Rack::Sendfile` received untrusted `x-sendfile-type` or `x-accel-mapping` headers from a client, it would interpret them as proxy configuration directives. This could cause the middleware to send a \"redirect\" response to the proxy, prompting it to reissue a new internal request that was not subject to the proxy's access controls. An attacker could exploit this by setting a crafted `x-sendfile-type: x-accel-redirect` header, setting a crafted `x-accel-mapping` header, and requesting a path that qualifies for proxy-based acceleration. Attackers could bypass proxy-enforced restrictions and access internal endpoints intended to be protected (such as administrative pages). The vulnerability did not allow arbitrary file reads but could expose sensitive application routes. This issue only affected systems meeting all of the following conditions: The application used `Rack::Sendfile` with a proxy that supports `x-accel-redirect` (e.g., Nginx); the proxy did **not** always set or remove the `x-sendfile-type` and `x-accel-mapping` headers; and the application exposed an endpoint that returned a body responding to `.to_path`. Users should upgrade to Rack versions 2.2.20, 3.1.18, or 3.2.3, which require explicit configuration to enable `x-accel-redirect`. Alternatively, configure the proxy to always set or strip the header, or in Rails applications, disable sendfile completely.										0.00030	2025-10-11 23:26:19	0.07403	1			4	1	1	5.8				2025-10-10 17:29:41	3.9	1.4																1		Rack has Possible Information Disclosure Vulnerability

In all versions of Akka.Remote from v1.2.0 to v1.5.51, TLS could be enabled via our `akka.remote.dot-netty.tcp` transport and this would correctly enforce private key validation on the server-side of inbound connections. Akka.Remote, however, never asked the outbound-connecting client to present ITS certificate - therefore it's possible for untrusted parties to connect to a private key'd Akka.NET cluster and begin communicating with it without any certificate. The issue here is that for certificate-based authentication to work properly, ensuring that all members of the Akka.Remote network are secured with the same private key, Akka.Remote needed to implement mutual TLS. This was not the case before Akka.NET v1.5.52. Those who run Akka.NET inside a private network that they fully control or who were never using TLS in the first place are now affected by the bug. However, those who use TLS to secure their networks must upgrade to Akka.NET V1.5.52 or later. One patch forces \"fail fast\" semantics if TLS is enabled but the private key is missing or invalid. Previous versions would only check that once connection attempts occurred. The second patch, a critical fix, enforces mutual TLS (mTLS) by default, so both parties must be keyed using the same certificate. As a workaround, avoid exposing the application publicly to avoid the vulnerability having a practical impact on one's application. However, upgrading to version 1.5.52 is still recommended by the maintainers.										0.00053	2025-10-12 23:45:33	0.16457	1			5	1	1	9.3			9.3	2025-10-06 17:52:09	0.0	0.0

A remote code execution vulnerability in python-socketio versions prior to 5.14.0 allows attackers to execute arbitrary Python code through malicious pickle deserialization in multi-server deployments on which the attacker previously gained access to the message queue that the servers use for internal communications. When Socket.IO servers are configured to use a message queue backend such as Redis for inter-server communication, messages sent between the servers are encoded using the `pickle` Python module. When a server receives one of these messages through the message queue, it assumes it is trusted and immediately deserializes it. The vulnerability stems from deserialization of messages using Python's `pickle.loads()` function. Having previously obtained access to the message queue, the attacker can send a python-socketio server a crafted pickle payload that executes arbitrary code during deserialization via Python's `__reduce__` method. This vulnerability only affects deployments with a compromised message queue. The attack can lead to the attacker executing random code in the context of, and with the privileges of a Socket.IO server process. Single-server systems that do not use a message queue, and multi-server systems with a secure message queue are not vulnerable. In addition to making sure standard security practices are followed in the deployment of the message queue, users of the python-socketio package can upgrade to version 5.14.0 or newer, which remove the `pickle` module and use the much safer JSON encoding for inter-server messaging.										0.00565	2025-10-12 23:45:33	0.67441	1			2	1	1	6.4		6.4		2025-10-06 16:50:49	0.9	5.5												1						python-socketio vulnerable to arbitrary Python code execution (RCE) through malicious pickle deserialization in certain multi-server deployments

A file upload vulnerability in version 3.0.7 of FlowiseAI allows authenticated users to upload arbitrary files without proper validation. This enables attackers to persistently store malicious Node.js web shells on the server, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The system fails to validate file extensions, MIME types, or file content during uploads. As a result, malicious scripts such as Node.js-based web shells can be uploaded and stored persistently on the server. These shells expose HTTP endpoints capable of executing arbitrary commands if triggered. The uploaded shell does not automatically execute, but its presence allows future exploitation via administrator error or chained vulnerabilities. This presents a high-severity threat to system integrity and confidentiality.

Wasmtime 37.0.0 and 37.0.1 have memory leaks in the C/C++ API when using bindings for the `anyref` or `externref` WebAssembly values. This is caused by a regression introduced during the development of 37.0.0 and all prior versions of Wasmtime are unaffected. If `anyref` or `externref` is not used in the C/C++ API then embeddings are also unaffected by the leaky behavior. The `wasmtime` Rust crate is unaffected by this leak.\n\nDevelopment of Wasmtime 37.0.0 included a refactoring in Rust of changing the old `ManuallyRooted<T>` type to a new `OwnedRooted<T>` type. This change was integrated into Wasmtime's C API but left the C API in a state which had memory leaks. Additionally the new ownership semantics around this type were not reflected into the C++ API, making it leak-prone. A short version of the change is that previously `ManuallyRooted<T>`, as the name implies, required manual calls to an \"unroot\" operation. If this was forgotten then the memory was still cleaned up when the `wasmtime_store_t` itself was destroyed eventually. Documentation of when to \"unroot\" was sparse and there were already situations prior to 37.0.0 where memory would be leaked until the store was destroyed anyway. All memory, though, was always bound by the store, and destroying the store would guarantee that there were no memory leaks.\n\nIn migrating to `OwnedRooted<T>` the usage of the type in Rust changed. A manual \"unroot\" operation is no longer required and it happens naturally as a destructor of the `OwnedRooted<T>` type in Rust itself. These new resource ownership semantics were not fully integrated into the preexisting semantics of the C/C++ APIs in Wasmtime. A crucial distinction of `OwnedRooted<T>` vs `ManuallyRooted<T>` is that the `OwnedRooted<T>` type allocates host memory outside of the store. This means that if an `OwnedRooted<T>` is leaked then destroying a store does not release this memory and it's a permanent memory leak on the host.\n\nThis led to a few distinct, but related, issues arising: A typo in the `wasmtime_val_unroot` function in the C API meant that it did not actually unroot anything. This meant that even if embedders faithfully call the function then memory will be leaked. If a host-defined function returned a `wasmtime_{externref,anyref}_t` value then the value was never unrooted. The C/C++ API no longer has access to the value and the Rust implementation did not unroot. This meant that any values returned this way were never unrooted. The goal of the C++ API of Wasmtime is to encode automatic memory management in the type system, but the C++ API was not updated when `OwnedRooted<T>` was added. This meant that idiomatic usage of the C++ API would leak memory due to a lack of destructors on values.\n\nThese issues have all been fixed in a 37.0.2 release of Wasmtime. The implementation of the C and C++ APIs have been updated accordingly and respectively to account for the changes of ownership here. For example `wasmtime_val_unroot` has been fixed to unroot, the Rust-side implementation of calling an embedder-defined function will unroot return values, and the C++ API now has destructors on the `ExternRef`, `AnyRef`, and `Val` types. These changes have been made to the 37.0.x release branch in a non-API-breaking fashion. Changes to the 38.0.0 release branch (and `main` in the Wasmtime repository) include minor API updates to better accommodate the API semantic changes. The only known workaround at this time is to avoid using `externref` and `anyref` in the C/C++ API of Wasmtime. If avoiding those types is not possible then it's required for users to update to mitigate the leak issue.										0.00023	2025-10-08 23:20:50	0.04808	1			3	1	1	1.0			1.0	2025-10-07 19:20:16	0.0	0.0																		Wasmtime has memory leak in C API with `externref` and `anyref` types

Versions 0.13.3 and below contain an unbounded memory allocation vulnerability in the IMAP protocol parser which allows remote attackers to exhaust server memory, potentially triggering the system's out-of-memory (OOM) killer and causing a denial of service. The CommandParser implementation enforces size limits on its dynamic buffer in most parsing states, but several state handlers omit these validation checks. This issue is fixed in version 0.13.4. A workaround for this issue is to implement rate limiting and connection monitoring at the network level, however this does not provide complete protection.										0.00169	2025-10-08 23:20:50	0.38577	1			3	1	1	7.5		7.5		2025-10-02 22:19:00	3.9	3.6															1			Unbounded Memory Allocation in Stalwart IMAP parser

In versions 1.7 and below, when MCP uses OAuth authentication with an untrusted MCP server, an attacker can impersonate a malicious MCP server and return crafted, maliciously injected commands during the interaction process, leading to command injection and potential remote code execution. If chained with an untrusted MCP service via OAuth, this command injection vulnerability could allow arbitrary code execution on the host by the agent. This can then be used to directly compromise the system by executing malicious commands with full user privileges.

Versions 1.6 and below are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks through Visual Studio Code Workspaces. Workspaces allow users to open more than a single folder and save specific settings (pretty similar to .vscode/settings.json) for the folders / project. An untitled workspace is automatically created by VS Code (untitled.code-workspace), which contains all the folders and workspace settings from the user's current session, opening up an entire new attack vector if the user has a .code-workspace file in path (either untitled created automatically or a saved one). If an attacker is able to hijack the chat context of the victim (such as via a compromised MCP server), they can use prompt injection to make the Cursor Agent write into this file and modify the workspace. This leads to a bypass of CVE-2025-54130 which can lead to RCE by writing to the settings section.

In versions 1.6 and below, Mermaid (a to render diagrams) allows embedding images which then get rendered by Cursor in the chat box. An attacker can use this to exfiltrate sensitive information to a third-party attacker controlled server through an image fetch after successfully performing a prompt injection. A malicious model (or hallucination/backdoor) might also trigger this exploit at will. This issue requires prompt injection from malicious data (web, image upload, source code) in order to exploit. In that case, it can send sensitive information to an attacker-controlled external server.

Stored frames can later be referenced by FTCH chunks. For files using subversion < 2, the undecoded frame is stored, and decoded again when the FTCH chunks are parsed. However, in process_frame_obj if the frame has an invalid size, there’s an early return, with a value of 0. \n\nThis causes the code in decode_frame to still store the raw frame buffer into ctx->stored_frame. Leaving ctx->has_dimensions set to false.\n\nA subsequent chunk with type FTCH would call process_ftch and decode that frame obj again, adding to the top/left values and calling process_frame_obj again.\nGiven that we never set ctx->have_dimensions before, this time we set the dimensions, calling init_buffers, which can reallocate the buffer in ctx->stored_frame, freeing the previous one. However, the GetByteContext object gb still holds a reference to the old buffer.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, when the code tries to decode the frame, codecs that accept a GetByteContext as a parameter will trigger a use-after-free read when using gb.\n\nGetByteContext is only used for reading bytes, so at most one could read invalid data. There are no heap allocations between the free and when the object is accessed. However, upon returning to process_ftch, the code restores the original values for top/left in stored_frame, writing 4 bytes to the freed data at offset 6, potentially corrupting the allocator’s metadata.\n\nThis issue can be triggered just by probing whether a file has the sanm format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend upgrading to version 8.0 or beyond.										0.00020	2025-10-12 23:45:33	0.03776	1			1	1	1	8.7			8.7	2025-10-06 08:42:49	0.0	0.0		1																Heap-buffer-overflow write in FFmpeg SANM process_ftch

In version 2.17.0, rate limits can be completely bypassed by manipulating the X-Forwarded-For header. This renders IP-based rate limiting ineffective against determined attackers. Litestar's RateLimitMiddleware uses `cache_key_from_request()` to generate cache keys for rate limiting. When an X-Forwarded-For header is present, the middleware trusts it unconditionally and uses its value as part of the client identifier. Since clients can set arbitrary X-Forwarded-For values, each different spoofed IP creates a separate rate limit bucket. An attacker can rotate through different header values to avoid hitting any single bucket's limit. This affects any Litestar application using RateLimitMiddleware with default settings, which likely includes most applications that implement rate limiting.

security-advisories@github.com	GitHub, Inc.	202500059146	CVE-2025-59146	2025	2025-10-09 18:58:51	2025-10-09 19:15:44				96	Received	New API is a large language mode (LLM) gateway and artificial intelligence (AI) asset management system. An authenticated Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in versions prior to 0.9.0.5. A feature within the application allows authenticated users to submit a URL for the server to process its content. The application fails to properly validate this user-supplied URL before making a server-side request. This vulnerability is not limited to image URLs and can be triggered with any link provided to the vulnerable endpoint. Since user registration is often enabled by default, any registered user can exploit this. By crafting a malicious URL, an attacker can coerce the server to send requests to arbitrary internal or external services. The vulnerability has been patched in version 0.9.0.5. The patch introduces a comprehensive, user-configurable SSRF protection module, which is enabled by default to protect server security. This new feature provides administrators with granular control over outbound requests made by the server. For users who cannot upgrade immediately, some temporary mitigation options are available. Enable new-api image processing worker (new-api-worker) and/or configure egress firewall rules.										0.00028	2025-10-10 23:08:11	0.06694	1			2	1	1	8.5		8.5		2025-10-09 19:07:44	3.1	4.7									1									New API has Authenticated Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) issue

A use-after-free (write) vulnerability has been detected in versions Poppler prior to 25.10.0 within the StructTreeRoot class. The issue arises from the use of raw pointers to elements of a `std::vector`, which can lead to dangling pointers when the vector is resized. The vulnerability stems from the way that refToParentMap stores references to `std::vector` elements using raw pointers. These pointers may become invalid when the vector is resized. This vulnerability is a common security problem involving the use of raw pointers to `std::vectors`. Internally, `std::vector `stores its elements in a dynamically allocated array. When the array reaches its capacity and a new element is added, the vector reallocates a larger block of memory and moves all the existing elements to the new location. At this point if any pointers to elements are stored before a resize occurs, they become dangling pointers once the reallocation happens. Version 25.10.0 contains a patch for the issue.										0.00013	2025-10-11 23:26:17	0.01511	1			3	1	1	6.1			6.1	2025-10-10 22:35:27	0.0	0.0		1																GHSL-2025-042: Poppler has Use-After-Free

Starting in version 4.3-milestone-1 and prior to versions 16.10.9, 17.4.2, and 17.5.0, the REST search URL is vulnerable to HQL injection via the `orderField` parameter. The specified value is added twice in the query, though, once in the field list for the select and once in the order clause, so it's not that easy to exploit. The part of the query between the two fields can be enclosed in single quotes to effectively remove them, but the query still needs to remain valid with the query two times in it. This has been patched in versions 17.5.0, 17.4.2, and 16.10.9.

The kernel maintains a root pointer and current page table level\nto enable proper page table walks in alloc_pte()/fetch_pte() operations.\n\nThe IOMMU IOVA allocator initially starts with 32-bit address and onces its\nexhuasted it switches to 64-bit address (max address is determined based\non IOMMU and device DMA capability). To support larger IOVA, AMD IOMMU\ndriver increases page table level.\n\nBut in unmap path (iommu_v1_unmap_pages()), fetch_pte() reads\npgtable->[root/mode] without lock. So its possible that in exteme corner case,\nwhen increase_address_space() is updating pgtable->[root/mode], fetch_pte()\nreads wrong page table level (pgtable->mode).

In both cases zpci_register_ioat()\nfails with a cc value indicating that the device handle is invalid. This\nis because the device is no longer part of the instance as far as the\nhypervisor is concerned.\n\nCurrently this leads to an error return and s390_iommu_attach_device()\nfails. This triggers the WARN_ON() in __iommu_group_set_domain_nofail()\nbecause attaching to the default domain must never fail.\n\nWith the device fenced by the hypervisor no DMAs to or from memory are\npossible and the IOMMU translations have no effect. Proceed as if the\nregistration was successful and let the hotplug event handling clean up\nthe device.\n\nThis is similar to how devices in the error state are handled since\ncommit 59bbf596791b (\"iommu/s390: Make attach succeed even if the device\nis in error state\") except that for removal the domain will not be\nregistered later. This approach was also previously discussed at the\nlink.\n\nHandle both cases, error state and removal, in a helper which checks if\nthe error needs to be propagated or ignored.

This function was introduced as part of\nhandling multi-buffer XDP support in the ice driver.\n\nIt works by iterating over the buffers from first_desc up to 1 plus the\ntotal number of fragments in the frame, cached from before the XDP program\nwas executed.\n\nIf the hardware posts a descriptor with a size of 0, the logic used in\nice_put_rx_mbuf() breaks. Such descriptors get skipped and don't get added\nas fragments in ice_add_xdp_frag. Since the buffer isn't counted as a\nfragment, we do not iterate over it in ice_put_rx_mbuf(), and thus we don't\ncall ice_put_rx_buf().\n\nBecause we don't call ice_put_rx_buf(), we don't attempt to re-use the\npage or free it. This leaves a stale page in the ring, as we don't\nincrement next_to_alloc.\n\nThe ice_reuse_rx_page() assumes that the next_to_alloc has been incremented\nproperly, and that it always points to a buffer with a NULL page. Since\nthis function doesn't check, it will happily recycle a page over the top\nof the next_to_alloc buffer, losing track of the old page.\n\nNote that this leak only occurs for multi-buffer frames. The\nice_put_rx_mbuf() function always handles at least one buffer, so a\nsingle-buffer frame will always get handled correctly. It is not clear\nprecisely why the hardware hands us descriptors with a size of 0 sometimes,\nbut it happens somewhat regularly with \"jumbo frames\" used by 9K MTU.\n\nTo fix ice_put_rx_mbuf(), we need to make sure to call ice_put_rx_buf() on\nall buffers between first_desc and next_to_clean. Borrow the logic of a\nsimilar function in i40e used for this same purpose. Use the same logic\nalso in ice_get_pgcnts().\n\nInstead of iterating over just the number of fragments, use a loop which\niterates until the current index reaches to the next_to_clean element just\npast the current frame. Unlike i40e, the ice_put_rx_mbuf() function does\ncall ice_put_rx_buf() on the last buffer of the frame indicating the end of\npacket.\n\nFor non-linear (multi-buffer) frames, we need to take care when adjusting\nthe pagecnt_bias. An XDP program might release fragments from the tail of\nthe frame, in which case that fragment page is already released. Only\nupdate the pagecnt_bias for the first descriptor and fragments still\nremaining post-XDP program. Take care to only access the shared info for\nfragmented buffers, as this avoids a significant cache miss.\n\nThe xdp_xmit value only needs to be updated if an XDP program is run, and\nonly once per packet. Drop the xdp_xmit pointer argument from\nice_put_rx_mbuf(). Instead, set xdp_xmit in the ice_clean_rx_irq() function\ndirectly. This avoids needing to pass the argument and avoids an extra\nbit-wise OR for each buffer in the frame.\n\nMove the increment of the ntc local variable to ensure its updated *before*\nall calls to ice_get_pgcnts() or ice_put_rx_mbuf(), as the loop logic\nrequires the index of the element just after the current frame.\n\nNow that we use an index pointer in the ring to identify the packet, we no\nlonger need to track or cache the number of fragments in the rx_ring.										0.00022	2025-10-10 23:08:05	0.04455	1			3			0.0					0.0	0.0																		ice: fix Rx page leak on multi-buffer frames

Additionally, the delayed work\nitem is cyclic, the flush_workqueue() in cnic_cm_stop_bnx2x_hw() only\nblocks and waits for work items that were already queued to the\nworkqueue prior to its invocation. Any work items submitted after\nflush_workqueue() is called are not included in the set of tasks that the\nflush operation awaits. This means that after the cyclic work items have\nfinished executing, a delayed work item may still exist in the workqueue.\nThis leads to use-after-free scenarios where the cnic_dev is deallocated\nby cnic_free_dev(), while delete_task remains active and attempt to\ndereference cnic_dev in cnic_delete_task().\n\nA typical race condition is illustrated below:\n\nCPU 0 (cleanup)              | CPU 1 (delayed work callback)\ncnic_netdev_event()          |\n  cnic_stop_hw()             | cnic_delete_task()\n    cnic_cm_stop_bnx2x_hw()  | ...\n      cancel_delayed_work()  | /* the queue_delayed_work()\n      flush_workqueue()      |    executes after flush_workqueue()*/\n                             | queue_delayed_work()\n  cnic_free_dev(dev)//free   | cnic_delete_task() //new instance\n                             |   dev = cp->dev; //use\n\nReplace cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() to ensure\nthat the cyclic delayed work item is properly canceled and that any\nongoing execution of the work item completes before the cnic_dev is\ndeallocated. Furthermore, since cancel_delayed_work_sync() uses\n__flush_work(work, true) to synchronously wait for any currently\nexecuting instance of the work item to finish, the flush_workqueue()\nbecomes redundant and should be removed.\n\nThis bug was identified through static analysis. To reproduce the issue\nand validate the fix, I simulated the cnic PCI device in QEMU and\nintroduced intentional delays — such as inserting calls to ssleep()\nwithin the cnic_delete_task() function — to increase the likelihood\nof triggering the bug.										0.00031	2025-10-10 23:08:05	0.07779	1			8			0.0					0.0	0.0		1																cnic: Fix use-after-free bugs in cnic_delete_task

Everywhere else,\n&pl->phydev->lock is acquired at the top level, and &pl->state_mutex at\nthe lower level. A clear example is phylink_bringup_phy().\n\nThe outlier is the newly introduced phy_config_inband() and the existing\nlock order is the correct one. To understand why it cannot be the other\nway around, it is sufficient to consider phylink_phy_change(), phylink's\ncallback from the PHY device's phy->phy_link_change() virtual method,\ninvoked by the PHY state machine.\n\nphy_link_up() and phy_link_down(), the (indirect) callers of\nphylink_phy_change(), are called with &phydev->lock acquired.\nThen phylink_phy_change() acquires its own &pl->state_mutex, to\nserialize changes made to its pl->phy_state and pl->link_config.\nSo all other instances of &pl->state_mutex and &phydev->lock must be\nconsistent with this order.\n\nProblem impact\n==============\n\nI think the kernel runs a serious deadlock risk if an existing\nphylink_resolve() thread, which results in a phy_config_inband() call,\nis concurrent with a phy_link_up() or phy_link_down() call, which will\ndeadlock on &pl->state_mutex in phylink_phy_change(). Practically\nspeaking, the impact may be limited by the slow speed of the medium\nauto-negotiation protocol, which makes it unlikely for the current state\nto still be unresolved when a new one is detected, but I think the\nproblem is there. Nonetheless, the problem was discovered using lockdep.\n\nProposed solution\n=================\n\nPractically speaking, the phy_config_inband() requirement of having\nphydev->lock acquired must transfer to the caller (phylink is the only\ncaller). There, it must bubble up until immediately before\n&pl->state_mutex is acquired, for the cases where that takes place.\n\nSolution details, considerations, notes\n=======================================\n\nThis is the phy_config_inband() call graph:\n\n                          sfp_upstream_ops :: connect_phy()\n                          |\n                          v\n                          phylink_sfp_connect_phy()\n                          |\n                          v\n                          phylink_sfp_config_phy()\n                          |\n                          |   sfp_upstream_ops :: module_insert()\n                          |   |\n                          |   v\n                          |   phylink_sfp_module_insert()\n                          |   |\n                          |   |   sfp_upstream_ops :: module_start()\n                          |   |   |\n                          |   |   v\n                          |   |   phylink_sfp_module_start()\n                          |   |   |\n                          |   v   v\n                          |   phylink_sfp_config_optical()\n phylink_start()          |   |\n   |   phylink_resume()   v   v\n   |   |  phylink_sfp_set_config()\n   |   |  |\n   v   v  v\n phylink_mac_initial_config()\n   |   phylink_resolve()\n   |   |  phylink_ethtool_ksettings_set()\n   v   v  v\n   phylink_major_config()\n            |\n            v\n    phy_config_inband()\n\nphylink_major_config() caller #1, phylink_mac_initial_config(), does not\nacquire &pl->state_mutex nor do its callers. It must acquire\n&pl->phydev->lock prior to calling phylink_major_config().\n\nphylink_major_config() caller #2, phylink_resolve() acquires\n&pl->state_mutex, thus also needs to acquire &pl->phydev->lock.\n\nphylink_major_config() caller #3, phylink_ethtool_ksettings_set(), is\ncompletely uninteresting, because it only call\n---truncated---										0.00024	2025-10-07 23:52:40	0.05206	1			2			0.0					0.0	0.0

[0]\n\nThe repro does the following:\n\n  1. Load a sk_msg prog that calls bpf_msg_cork_bytes(msg, cork_bytes)\n  2. Attach the prog to a SOCKMAP\n  3. Add a socket to the SOCKMAP\n  4. Activate fault injection\n  5. Send data less than cork_bytes\n\nAt 5., the data is carried over to the next sendmsg() as it is\nsmaller than the cork_bytes specified by bpf_msg_cork_bytes().\n\nThen, tcp_bpf_send_verdict() tries to allocate psock->cork to hold\nthe data, but this fails silently due to fault injection + __GFP_NOWARN.\n\nIf the allocation fails, we need to revert the sk->sk_forward_alloc\nchange done by sk_msg_alloc().\n\nLet's call sk_msg_free() when tcp_bpf_send_verdict fails to allocate\npsock->cork.\n\nThe \"*copied\" also needs to be updated such that a proper error can\nbe returned to the caller, sendmsg. It fails to allocate psock->cork.\nNothing has been corked so far, so this patch simply sets \"*copied\"\nto 0.\n\n[0]:\nWARNING: net/ipv4/af_inet.c:156 at inet_sock_destruct+0x623/0x730 net/ipv4/af_inet.c:156, CPU#1: syz-executor/5983\nModules linked in:\nCPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 5983 Comm: syz-executor Not tainted syzkaller #0 PREEMPT(full)\nHardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 07/12/2025\nRIP: 0010:inet_sock_destruct+0x623/0x730 net/ipv4/af_inet.c:156\nCode: 0f 0b 90 e9 62 fe ff ff e8 7a db b5 f7 90 0f 0b 90 e9 95 fe ff ff e8 6c db b5 f7 90 0f 0b 90 e9 bb fe ff ff e8 5e db b5 f7 90 <0f> 0b 90 e9 e1 fe ff ff 89 f9 80 e1 07 80 c1 03 38 c1 0f 8c 9f fc\nRSP: 0018:ffffc90000a08b48 EFLAGS: 00010246\nRAX: ffffffff8a09d0b2 RBX: dffffc0000000000 RCX: ffff888024a23c80\nRDX: 0000000000000100 RSI: 0000000000000fff RDI: 0000000000000000\nRBP: 0000000000000fff R08: ffff88807e07c627 R09: 1ffff1100fc0f8c4\nR10: dffffc0000000000 R11: ffffed100fc0f8c5 R12: ffff88807e07c380\nR13: dffffc0000000000 R14: ffff88807e07c60c R15: 1ffff1100fc0f872\nFS:  00005555604c4500(0000) GS:ffff888125af1000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: 00005555604df5c8 CR3: 0000000032b06000 CR4: 00000000003526f0\nCall Trace:\n <IRQ>\n __sk_destruct+0x86/0x660 net/core/sock.c:2339\n rcu_do_batch kernel/rcu/tree.c:2605 [inline]\n rcu_core+0xca8/0x1770 kernel/rcu/tree.c:2861\n handle_softirqs+0x286/0x870 kernel/softirq.c:579\n __do_softirq kernel/softirq.c:613 [inline]\n invoke_softirq kernel/softirq.c:453 [inline]\n __irq_exit_rcu+0xca/0x1f0 kernel/softirq.c:680\n irq_exit_rcu+0x9/0x30 kernel/softirq.c:696\n instr_sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt arch/x86/kernel/apic/apic.c:1052 [inline]\n sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt+0xa6/0xc0 arch/x86/kernel/apic/apic.c:1052\n </IRQ>										0.00032	2025-10-07 23:52:40	0.08106	1			8			0.0					0.0	0.0

So pl->phydev->lock needs to be\nacquired prior to pl->state_mutex. But that requires dereferencing\npl->phydev in the first place, and without pl->state_mutex, that is\nracy.\n\nHence the reason for the extra lock. Currently it is redundant, but it\nwill serve a functional purpose once mutex_lock(&phy->lock) will be\nmoved outside of the mutex_lock(&pl->state_mutex) section.\n\nAnother alternative considered would have been to let phylink_resolve()\nacquire the rtnl_mutex, which is also held when phylink_bringup_phy()\nand phylink_disconnect_phy() are called. But since phylink_disconnect_phy()\nruns under rtnl_lock(), it would deadlock with phylink_resolve() when\ncalling flush_work(&pl->resolve). Additionally, it would have been\nundesirable because it would have unnecessarily blocked many other call\npaths as well in the entire kernel, so the smaller-scoped lock was\npreferred.										0.00024	2025-10-07 23:52:40	0.05206	1			2			0.0					0.0	0.0

They both use a static\n256 byte buffer which is initialized to the empty string. In the case of\nthe 'command' file this buffer is literally never used and simply wastes\nspace. In the case of the 'netdev_ops' file, the last command written is\nsaved here.\n\nOn read, the files contents are presented as the name of the device\nfollowed by a colon and then the contents of their respective static\nbuffer. For 'command' this will always be \"<device>: \". For 'netdev_ops',\nthis will be \"<device>: <last command written>\". But note the buffer is\nshared between all devices operated by this module. At best, it is mostly\nmeaningless information, and at worse it could be accessed simultaneously\nas there doesn't appear to be any locking mechanism.\n\nWe have also recently received multiple reports for both read functions\nabout their use of snprintf and potential overflow that could result in\nreading arbitrary kernel memory. For the 'command' file, this is definitely\nimpossible, since the static buffer is always zero and never written to.\nFor the 'netdev_ops' file, it does appear to be possible, if the user\ncarefully crafts the command input, it will be copied into the buffer,\nwhich could be large enough to cause snprintf to truncate, which then\ncauses the copy_to_user to read beyond the length of the buffer allocated\nby kzalloc.\n\nA minimal fix would be to replace snprintf() with scnprintf() which would\ncap the return to the number of bytes written, preventing an overflow. A\nmore involved fix would be to drop the mostly useless static buffers,\nsaving 512 bytes and modifying the read functions to stop needing those as\ninput.\n\nInstead, lets just completely drop the read access to these files. These\nare debug interfaces exposed as part of debugfs, and I don't believe that\ndropping read access will break any script, as the provided output is\npretty useless. You can find the netdev name through other more standard\ninterfaces, and the 'netdev_ops' interface can easily result in garbage if\nyou issue simultaneous writes to multiple devices at once.\n\nIn order to properly remove the i40e_dbg_netdev_ops_buf, we need to\nrefactor its write function to avoid using the static buffer. Instead, use\nthe same logic as the i40e_dbg_command_write, with an allocated buffer.\nUpdate the code to use this instead of the static buffer, and ensure we\nfree the buffer on exit. This fixes simultaneous writes to 'netdev_ops' on\nmultiple devices, and allows us to remove the now unused static buffer\nalong with removing the read access.										0.00022	2025-10-07 23:52:40	0.04432	1			3			0.0					0.0	0.0

Because adbd is privileged and the device’s USB port is exposed externally, an attacker with physical access can write an arbitrary file to a writable location and then overwrite the kernel’s uevent_helper or /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug entries via ADB, causing the script to be executed with root privileges.										0.00041	2025-10-07 23:52:39	0.11951	1			3	1	1	8.6			8.6	2025-10-06 23:57:35	0.0	0.0																		Tesla Telematics Control Unit (TCU) < v2025.14 Authentication Bypass

After a successful malformed upload the runtime continues to operate until a restart; on restart the runtime can fail to start because of corrupted database entries, resulting in persistent denial of service requiring complete rebase of the product to recover. This vulnerability was remediated by commit 095ee09623dd229b64ad3a1db38a901a3772f6fc.										0.00071	2025-10-09 23:48:54	0.22210	1			5	1	1	7.1			7.1	2025-10-03 16:37:24	0.0	0.0															1			OpenPLC Runtime v3 Persistent DoS

Any local user - or any process that can read the host filesystem - can retrieve all of these secrets in plain text, leading to credential theft and full compromise of the appliance.

The hashing is performed via PHP's `hash()` function in multiple files (server_write_requests_users.php, update_database.php, legacy/Login.php, tests/Unit/Api/IdpControllerTest.php). No per-user salt is used and the fast hash algorithms are unsuitable for password storage. An attacker who obtains the password database can recover cleartext passwords via offline dictionary or rainbow table attacks. The vulnerable code also contains logic that migrates legacy SHA-1 hashes to SHA-512 on login, further exposing users still on the old hash. This vulnerability was partially resolved, but still present within the legacy authentication platform.										0.00048	2025-10-10 23:08:04	0.14496	1			5	2	1	8.2		7.5	8.2	2025-10-02 17:14:03	3.9	3.6

This vulnerability arises because the class allows the use of arbitrary XSLT stylesheets, which are parsed using lxml.etree.parse() and lxml.etree.XSLT() without any hardening measures. In lxml versions up to 4.9.x, external entities are resolved by default, allowing attackers to read arbitrary local files or perform outbound HTTP(S) fetches. In lxml versions 5.0 and above, while entity expansion is disabled, the XSLT document() function can still read any URI unless XSLTAccessControl is applied. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to gain read-only access to any file the LangChain process can reach, including sensitive files such as SSH keys, environment files, source code, or cloud metadata. No authentication, special privileges, or user interaction are required, and the issue is exploitable in default deployments that enable custom XSLT.										0.00233	2025-10-12 23:45:34	0.46053	1			1	1	1	7.5		7.5		2025-10-06 18:52:58	3.9	3.6								1										XXE Vulnerability in langchain-ai/langchain

In that series, the patch adding failure behavior to rbtree_add\nand list_push_{front, back} breaks this assumption for non-owning\nreferences.\n\nConsider the following program:\n\n  n = bpf_kptr_xchg(&mapval, NULL);\n  /* skip error checking */\n\n  bpf_spin_lock(&l);\n  if(bpf_rbtree_add(&t, &n->rb, less)) {\n    bpf_refcount_acquire(n);\n    /* Failed to add, do something else with the node */\n  }\n  bpf_spin_unlock(&l);\n\nIt's incorrect to assume that bpf_refcount_acquire will always succeed in this\nscenario. bpf_refcount_acquire is being called in a critical section\nhere, but the lock being held is associated with rbtree t, which isn't\nnecessarily the lock associated with the tree that the node is already\nin. So after bpf_rbtree_add fails to add the node and calls bpf_obj_drop\nin it, the program has no ownership of the node's lifetime. Therefore\nthe node's refcount can be decr'd to 0 at any time after the failing\nrbtree_add.

It is implied that an allocated remain_skb is\nprocessed and subsequently freed (in error paths) only during the next\ncall of ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream().\n\nSo, if the urbs are deallocated between those two calls due to the device\ndeinitialization or suspend, it is possible that ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream()\nis not called next time and the allocated remain_skb is leaked. Our local\nSyzkaller instance was able to trigger that.\n\nremain_skb makes sense when receiving two consecutive urbs which are\nlogically linked together, i.e. a specific data field from the first skb\nindicates a cached skb to be allocated, memcpy'd with some data and\nsubsequently processed in the next call to ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream(). Urbs\ndeallocation supposedly makes that link irrelevant so we need to free the\ncached skb in those cases.\n\nFix the leak by introducing a function to explicitly free remain_skb (if\nit is not NULL) when the rx urbs have been deallocated. remain_skb is NULL\nwhen it has not been allocated at all (hif_dev struct is kzalloced) or\nwhen it has been processed in next call to ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream().\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.										0.00024	2025-10-08 23:20:33	0.05321	1			8			0.0		7.0		2025-10-08 02:01:12	0.0	0.0																		wifi: ath9k: hif_usb: fix memory leak of remain_skbs

In\nswapoff(), the memory used by si could be kept in swap_info[] after\nturning off a swap.  This means memory corruption will not be caused\nimmediately until allocated and reset for a new swap in the swapon path. \nA panic message caused: (with CONFIG_PLIST_DEBUG enabled)\n\n------------[ cut here ]------------\ntop: 00000000e58a3003, n: 0000000013e75cda, p: 000000008cd4451a\nprev: 0000000035b1e58a, n: 000000008cd4451a, p: 000000002150ee8d\nnext: 000000008cd4451a, n: 000000008cd4451a, p: 000000008cd4451a\nWARNING: CPU: 21 PID: 1843 at lib/plist.c:60 plist_check_prev_next_node+0x50/0x70\nModules linked in: rfkill(E) crct10dif_ce(E)...\nCPU: 21 PID: 1843 Comm: stress-ng Kdump: ... 5.10.134+\nHardware name: Alibaba Cloud ECS, BIOS 0.0.0 02/06/2015\npstate: 60400005 (nZCv daif +PAN -UAO -TCO BTYPE=--)\npc : plist_check_prev_next_node+0x50/0x70\nlr : plist_check_prev_next_node+0x50/0x70\nsp : ffff0018009d3c30\nx29: ffff0018009d3c40 x28: ffff800011b32a98\nx27: 0000000000000000 x26: ffff001803908000\nx25: ffff8000128ea088 x24: ffff800011b32a48\nx23: 0000000000000028 x22: ffff001800875c00\nx21: ffff800010f9e520 x20: ffff001800875c00\nx19: ffff001800fdc6e0 x18: 0000000000000030\nx17: 0000000000000000 x16: 0000000000000000\nx15: 0736076307640766 x14: 0730073007380731\nx13: 0736076307640766 x12: 0730073007380731\nx11: 000000000004058d x10: 0000000085a85b76\nx9 : ffff8000101436e4 x8 : ffff800011c8ce08\nx7 : 0000000000000000 x6 : 0000000000000001\nx5 : ffff0017df9ed338 x4 : 0000000000000001\nx3 : ffff8017ce62a000 x2 : ffff0017df9ed340\nx1 : 0000000000000000 x0 : 0000000000000000\nCall trace:\n plist_check_prev_next_node+0x50/0x70\n plist_check_head+0x80/0xf0\n plist_add+0x28/0x140\n add_to_avail_list+0x9c/0xf0\n _enable_swap_info+0x78/0xb4\n __do_sys_swapon+0x918/0xa10\n __arm64_sys_swapon+0x20/0x30\n el0_svc_common+0x8c/0x220\n do_el0_svc+0x2c/0x90\n el0_svc+0x1c/0x30\n el0_sync_handler+0xa8/0xb0\n el0_sync+0x148/0x180\nirq event stamp: 2082270\n\nNow, si->lock locked before calling 'del_from_avail_list()' to make sure\nother thread see the si had been deleted and SWP_WRITEOK cleared together,\nwill not reinsert again.\n\nThis problem exists in versions after stable 5.10.y.										0.00024	2025-10-08 23:20:33	0.05321	1			8			0.0		7.0		2025-10-08 02:01:29	0.0	0.0		1																mm/swap: fix swap_info_struct race between swapoff and get_swap_pages()

All the real work is done\nglobally by the initcall and CPU hotplug notifiers, while the \"driver\"\neffectively just wraps an allocation and the registration of the hwmon\ninterface in a long-winded round-trip through the driver core.  The whole\nlogic of dynamically creating and destroying platform devices to bring\nthe interfaces up and down is error prone, since it assumes\nplatform_device_add() will synchronously bind the driver and set drvdata\nbefore it returns, thus results in a NULL dereference if drivers_autoprobe\nis turned off for the platform bus. Furthermore, the unusual approach of\ndoing that from within a CPU hotplug notifier, already commented in the\ncode that it deadlocks suspend, also causes lockdep issues for other\ndrivers or subsystems which may want to legitimately register a CPU\nhotplug notifier from a platform bus notifier.\n\nAll of these issues can be solved by ripping this unusual behaviour out\ncompletely, simply tying the platform devices to the lifetime of the\nmodule itself, and directly managing the hwmon interfaces from the\nhotplug notifiers. There is a slight user-visible change in that\n/sys/bus/platform/drivers/coretemp will no longer appear, and\n/sys/devices/platform/coretemp.n will remain present if package n is\nhotplugged off, but hwmon users should really only be looking for the\npresence of the hwmon interfaces, whose behaviour remains unchanged.										0.00032	2025-10-10 23:07:46	0.08170	1			6			0.0					0.0	0.0																		hwmon: (coretemp) Simplify platform device handling

One is\nembedded in the compound and is used directly in synchronous copies. The\nother is dynamically allocated, refcounted and tracked in the client\nstruture. For the embedded one, the cleanup just involves releasing any\nnfsd_files held on its behalf. For the async one, the cleanup is a bit\nmore involved, and we need to dequeue it from lists, unhash it, etc.\n\nThere is at least one potential refcount leak in this code now. If the\nkthread_create call fails, then both the src and dst nfsd_files in the\noriginal nfsd4_copy object are leaked.\n\nThe cleanup in this codepath is also sort of weird. In the async copy\ncase, we'll have up to four nfsd_file references (src and dst for both\nflavors of copy structure). They are both put at the end of\nnfsd4_do_async_copy, even though the ones held on behalf of the embedded\none outlive that structure.\n\nChange it so that we always clean up the nfsd_file refs held by the\nembedded copy structure before nfsd4_copy returns. Rework\ncleanup_async_copy to handle both inter and intra copies.

This is documented\nin the read_folio section of Documentation/filesystems/vfs.rst as:\n\n> The filesystem should unlock the folio once the read has completed,\n> whether it was successful or not.\n\nWithout this change, when fscache is in use and cache hit occurs during\na read, the page lock is leaked, producing the following stack on\nsubsequent reads (via mmap) to the page:\n\n$ cat /proc/3890/task/12864/stack\n[<0>] folio_wait_bit_common+0x124/0x350\n[<0>] filemap_read_folio+0xad/0xf0\n[<0>] filemap_fault+0x8b1/0xab0\n[<0>] __do_fault+0x39/0x150\n[<0>] do_fault+0x25c/0x3e0\n[<0>] __handle_mm_fault+0x6ca/0xc70\n[<0>] handle_mm_fault+0xe9/0x350\n[<0>] do_user_addr_fault+0x225/0x6c0\n[<0>] exc_page_fault+0x84/0x1b0\n[<0>] asm_exc_page_fault+0x27/0x30\n\nThis requires a reboot to resolve; it is a deadlock.\n\nNote however that the call to cifs_readpage_from_fscache does mark the\npage clean, but does not free the folio lock. This happens in\n__cifs_readpage_from_fscache on success. Releasing the lock at that\npoint however is not appropriate as cifs_readahead also calls\ncifs_readpage_from_fscache and *does* unconditionally release the lock\nafter its return. This change therefore effectively makes\ncifs_readpage_worker work like cifs_readahead.										0.00032	2025-10-10 23:07:46	0.08170	1			8			0.0					0.0	0.0																		cifs: Release folio lock on fscache read hit.

Due to peer flows offload implementation\nthe lock is taken much higher up the call chain and there is no obvious way\nto easily fix the deadlock. Instead, since tc route query code needs the\npeer eswitch structure only to perform a lookup in xarray and doesn't\nperform any sleeping operations with it, refactor the code for lockless\nexecution in following ways:\n\n- RCUify the devcom 'data' pointer. When resetting the pointer\nsynchronously wait for RCU grace period before returning. This is fine\nsince devcom is currently only used for synchronization of\npairing/unpairing of eswitches which is rare and already expensive as-is.\n\n- Wrap all usages of 'paired' boolean in {READ|WRITE}_ONCE(). The flag has\nalready been used in some unlocked contexts without proper\nannotations (e.g. users of mlx5_devcom_is_paired() function), but it wasn't\nan issue since all relevant code paths checked it again after obtaining the\ndevcom semaphore. Now it is also used by mlx5_devcom_get_peer_data_rcu() as\n\"best effort\" check to return NULL when devcom is being unpaired. Note that\nwhile RCU read lock doesn't prevent the unpaired flag from being changed\nconcurrently it still guarantees that reader can continue to use 'data'.\n\n- Refactor mlx5e_tc_query_route_vport() function to use new\nmlx5_devcom_get_peer_data_rcu() API which fixes the deadlock.\n\n[0]:\n\n[  164.599612] ======================================================\n[  164.600142] WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected\n[  164.600667] 6.3.0-rc3+ #1 Not tainted\n[  164.601021] ------------------------------------------------------\n[  164.601557] handler1/3456 is trying to acquire lock:\n[  164.601998] ffff88811f1714b0 (&esw->offloads.encap_tbl_lock){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: mlx5e_attach_encap+0xd8/0x8b0 [mlx5_core]\n[  164.603078]\n               but task is already holding lock:\n[  164.603617] ffff88810137fc98 (&comp->sem){++++}-{3:3}, at: mlx5_devcom_get_peer_data+0x37/0x80 [mlx5_core]\n[  164.604459]\n               which lock already depends on the new lock.\n\n[  164.605190]\n               the existing dependency chain (in reverse order) is:\n[  164.605848]\n               -> #1 (&comp->sem){++++}-{3:3}:\n[  164.606380]        down_read+0x39/0x50\n[  164.606772]        mlx5_devcom_get_peer_data+0x37/0x80 [mlx5_core]\n[  164.607336]        mlx5e_tc_query_route_vport+0x86/0xc0 [mlx5_core]\n[  164.607914]        mlx5e_tc_tun_route_lookup+0x1a4/0x1d0 [mlx5_core]\n[  164.608495]        mlx5e_attach_decap_route+0xc6/0x1e0 [mlx5_core]\n[  164.609063]        mlx5e_tc_add_fdb_flow+0x1ea/0x360 [mlx5_core]\n[  164.609627]        __mlx5e_add_fdb_flow+0x2d2/0x430 [mlx5_core]\n[  164.610175]        mlx5e_configure_flower+0x952/0x1a20 [mlx5_core]\n[  164.610741]        tc_setup_cb_add+0xd4/0x200\n[  164.611146]        fl_hw_replace_filter+0x14c/0x1f0 [cls_flower]\n[  164.611661]        fl_change+0xc95/0x18a0 [cls_flower]\n[  164.612116]        tc_new_tfilter+0x3fc/0xd20\n[  164.612516]        rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x418/0x5b0\n[  164.612936]        netlink_rcv_skb+0x54/0x100\n[  164.613339]        netlink_unicast+0x190/0x250\n[  164.613746]        netlink_sendmsg+0x245/0x4a0\n[  164.614150]        sock_sendmsg+0x38/0x60\n[  164.614522]        ____sys_sendmsg+0x1d0/0x1e0\n[  164.614934]        ___sys_sendmsg+0x80/0xc0\n[  164.615320]        __sys_sendmsg+0x51/0x90\n[  164.615701]        do_syscall_64+0x3d/0x90\n[  164.616083]        entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x46/0xb0\n[  164.616568]\n               -> #0 (&esw->offloads.encap_tbl_lock){+.+.}-{3:3}:\n[  164.617210]        __lock_acquire+0x159e/0x26e0\n[  164.617638]        lock_acquire+0xc2/0x2a0\n[  164.618018]        __mutex_lock+0x92/0xcd0\n[  164.618401]        mlx5e_attach_encap+0xd8/0x8b0 [mlx5_core]\n[  164.618943]        post_process_attr+0x153/0x2d0 [\n---truncated---										0.00024	2025-10-10 23:07:46	0.04938	1			4			0.0					0.0	0.0																		net/mlx5e: Fix deadlock in tc route query code

A new UDP socket is created\nin TCP_CLOSE state but without SOCK_RCU_FREE set.

This changed\nin commit 0c48eefae712 (\"sock_map: Lift socket state restriction\nfor datagram sockets\"), but the helper wasn't adjusted accordingly.\nThe following sequence of events will therefore lead to a refcount\nleak:\n\n1.

If the interrupt takes too long, the perf framework\nwill lower the sysctl_perf_event_sample_rate and max_samples_per_tick.\nWhen hwc->interrupts is larger than max_samples_per_tick, the\nhwc->interrupts will be set to MAX_INTERRUPTS, and events will be\nthrottled within the __perf_event_account_interrupt() function.\n\nHowever, the RISC-V PMU driver doesn't call riscv_pmu_stop() to update the\nPERF_HES_STOPPED flag after perf_event_overflow() in pmu_sbi_ovf_handler()\nfunction to avoid throttling.

The panic\ninvolves a somewhat complicated interaction between the kernel driver\nand a userspace component (as described in the Link tag below), but\nthe analysis did make one thing clear: The Gadget core should\naccomodate gadget drivers calling usb_gadget_deactivate() as part of\ntheir unbind procedure.\n\nCurrently this doesn't work.  gadget_unbind_driver() calls\ndriver->unbind() while holding the udc->connect_lock mutex, and\nusb_gadget_deactivate() attempts to acquire that mutex, which will\nresult in a deadlock.\n\nThe simple fix is for gadget_unbind_driver() to release the mutex when\ninvoking the ->unbind() callback.  There is no particular reason for\nit to be holding the mutex at that time, and the mutex isn't held\nwhile the ->bind() callback is invoked.  So we'll drop the mutex\nbefore performing the unbind callback and reacquire it afterward.\n\nWe'll also add a couple of comments to usb_gadget_activate() and\nusb_gadget_deactivate().  Because they run in process context they\nmust not be called from a gadget driver's ->disconnect() callback,\nwhich (according to the kerneldoc for struct usb_gadget_driver in\ninclude/linux/usb/gadget.h) may run in interrupt context.  This may\nhelp prevent similar bugs from arising in the future.										0.00022	2025-10-10 23:07:46	0.04455	1			3			0.0					0.0	0.0																		USB: Gadget: core: Help prevent panic during UVC unconfigure

So when __cpu_map_ring_cleanup() checks\nthe ptr_ring, it will find it was not emptied and report a warning.\n\nAn alternative fix is to use __cpu_map_ring_cleanup() to drop these\npending frames or skbs when kthread_stop() returns -EINTR, but it may\nconfuse the user, because these frames or skbs have been handled\ncorrectly by XDP program. So instead of dropping these frames or skbs,\njust make sure the per-cpu kthread is running before\n__cpu_map_entry_alloc() returns.\n\nAfter apply the fix, the error handle for kthread_stop() will be\nunnecessary because it will always return 0, so just remove it.										0.00023	2025-10-10 23:07:46	0.04851	1			4			0.0					0.0	0.0																		bpf, cpumap: Make sure kthread is running before map update returns

The\npatch 5f7b51bf09ba (\"netfilter: ipset: Limit the maximal range of\nconsecutive elements to add/delete\") tried to fix it by limiting the max\nelements to process at all. However it was not enough, it is still possible\nthat we get hung tasks. Lowering the limit is not reasonable, so the\napproach in this patch is as follows: rely on the method used at resizing\nsets and save the state when we reach a smaller internal batch limit,\nunlock/lock and proceed from the saved state. Thus we can avoid long\ncontinuous tasks and at the same time removed the limit to add/delete large\nnumber of elements in one step.\n\nThe nfnl mutex is held during the whole operation which prevents one to\nissue other ipset commands in parallel.										0.00024	2025-10-10 23:07:46	0.05143	1			5			0.0					0.0	0.0																		netfilter: ipset: Rework long task execution when adding/deleting entries

So actually the caller\nproceeds with freeing the blk_crypto_key regardless of the return value\nof blk_crypto_evict_key().\n\nThese two assumptions don't match, and the result is that there can be a\nuse-after-free in blk_crypto_reprogram_all_keys() after one of these\nerrors occurs.

Later in\ngs_can_close() a reset control message is send to each CAN channel to\nremove the controller from the CAN bus. In this race window the USB\ndevice can still receive CAN frames from the bus and internally queue\nthem to be send to the host.\n\nAt least in the current version of the candlelight firmware, the queue\nof received CAN frames is not emptied during the reset command. After\nloading (or binding) the gs_usb driver, new URBs are submitted during\nthe struct net_device_ops::ndo_open callback and the candlelight\nfirmware starts sending its already queued CAN frames to the host.\n\nHowever, this scenario was not considered when implementing the\nhardware timestamp function. The cycle counter/time counter\ninfrastructure is set up (gs_usb_timestamp_init()) after the USBs are\nsubmitted, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference if\ntimecounter_cyc2time() (via the call chain:\ngs_usb_receive_bulk_callback() -> gs_usb_set_timestamp() ->\ngs_usb_skb_set_timestamp()) is called too early.\n\nMove the gs_usb_timestamp_init() function before the URBs are\nsubmitted to fix this problem.\n\nFor a comprehensive solution, we need to consider gs_usb devices with\nmore than 1 channel. The cycle counter/time counter infrastructure is\nsetup per channel, but the RX URBs are per device. Once gs_can_open()\nof _a_ channel has been called, and URBs have been submitted, the\ngs_usb_receive_bulk_callback() can be called for _all_ available\nchannels, even for channels that are not running, yet. As cycle\ncounter/time counter has not set up, this will again lead to a NULL\npointer dereference.\n\nConvert the cycle counter/time counter from a \"per channel\" to a \"per\ndevice\" functionality. Also set it up, before submitting any URBs to\nthe device.\n\nFurther in gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(), don't process any URBs for\nnot started CAN channels, only resubmit the URB.										0.00024	2025-10-07 23:52:23	0.05206	1			2			0.0		7.0		2025-10-02 01:01:22	0.0	0.0		1

However, if a\nmalicious attaker (or fuzzer) modifies the superblock via the block\ndevice while it is the file system is mounted, it is possible for\ns_first_data_block to get set to a very large number.  In that case,\nwhen calculating the block group of some block number (such as the\nstarting block of a preallocation region), could result in an\nunderflow and very large block group number.  Then the BUG_ON check in\next4_get_group_info() would fire, resutling in a denial of service\nattack that can be triggered by root or someone with write access to\nthe block device.\n\nFor a quality of implementation perspective, it's best that even if\nthe system administrator does something that they shouldn't, that it\nwill not trigger a BUG.  So instead of BUG'ing, ext4_get_group_info()\nwill call ext4_error and return NULL.  We also add fallback code in\nall of the callers of ext4_get_group_info() that it might NULL.\n\nAlso, since ext4_get_group_info() was already borderline to be an\ninline function, un-inline it.  The results in a next reduction of the\ncompiled text size of ext4 by roughly 2k.										0.00024	2025-10-07 23:52:23	0.04910	1			5			0.0		7.0		2025-10-02 01:01:27	0.0	0.0															1

We can reproduce the problem with these sequences:\n\n  sk = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0)\n  sk.setsockopt(SOL_SOCKET, SO_TIMESTAMPING, SOF_TIMESTAMPING_TX_SOFTWARE)\n  sk.setsockopt(SOL_SOCKET, SO_ZEROCOPY, 1)\n  sk.sendto(b'', MSG_ZEROCOPY, ('127.0.0.1', 53))\n  sk.close()\n\nsendmsg() calls msg_zerocopy_alloc(), which allocates a skb, sets\nskb->cb->ubuf.refcnt to 1, and calls sock_hold().  Here, struct\nubuf_info_msgzc indirectly holds a refcnt of the socket.  When the\nskb is sent, __skb_tstamp_tx() clones it and puts the clone into\nthe socket's error queue with the TX timestamp.\n\nWhen the original skb is received locally, skb_copy_ubufs() calls\nskb_unclone(), and pskb_expand_head() increments skb->cb->ubuf.refcnt.\nThis additional count is decremented while freeing the skb, but struct\nubuf_info_msgzc still has a refcnt, so __msg_zerocopy_callback() is\nnot called.\n\nThe last refcnt is not released unless we retrieve the TX timestamped\nskb by recvmsg().  Since we clear the error queue in inet_sock_destruct()\nafter the socket's refcnt reaches 0, there is a circular dependency.\nIf we close() the socket holding such skbs, we never call sock_put()\nand leak the count, sk, and skb.\n\nTCP has the same problem, and commit e0c8bccd40fc (\"net: stream:\npurge sk_error_queue in sk_stream_kill_queues()\") tried to fix it\nby calling skb_queue_purge() during close().  However, there is a\nsmall chance that skb queued in a qdisc or device could be put\ninto the error queue after the skb_queue_purge() call.\n\nIn __skb_tstamp_tx(), the cloned skb should not have a reference\nto the ubuf to remove the circular dependency, but skb_clone() does\nnot call skb_copy_ubufs() for zerocopy skb.  So, we need to call\nskb_orphan_frags_rx() for the cloned skb to call skb_copy_ubufs().\n\n[0]:\nBUG: memory leak\nunreferenced object 0xffff88800c6d2d00 (size 1152):\n  comm \"syz-executor392\", pid 264, jiffies 4294785440 (age 13.044s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 cd af e8 81 00 00 00 00  ................\n    02 00 07 40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ...@............\n  backtrace:\n    [<0000000055636812>] sk_prot_alloc+0x64/0x2a0 net/core/sock.c:2024\n    [<0000000054d77b7a>] sk_alloc+0x3b/0x800 net/core/sock.c:2083\n    [<0000000066f3c7e0>] inet_create net/ipv4/af_inet.c:319 [inline]\n    [<0000000066f3c7e0>] inet_create+0x31e/0xe40 net/ipv4/af_inet.c:245\n    [<000000009b83af97>] __sock_create+0x2ab/0x550 net/socket.c:1515\n    [<00000000b9b11231>] sock_create net/socket.c:1566 [inline]\n    [<00000000b9b11231>] __sys_socket_create net/socket.c:1603 [inline]\n    [<00000000b9b11231>] __sys_socket_create net/socket.c:1588 [inline]\n    [<00000000b9b11231>] __sys_socket+0x138/0x250 net/socket.c:1636\n    [<000000004fb45142>] __do_sys_socket net/socket.c:1649 [inline]\n    [<000000004fb45142>] __se_sys_socket net/socket.c:1647 [inline]\n    [<000000004fb45142>] __x64_sys_socket+0x73/0xb0 net/socket.c:1647\n    [<0000000066999e0e>] do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:50 [inline]\n    [<0000000066999e0e>] do_syscall_64+0x38/0x90 arch/x86/entry/common.c:80\n    [<0000000017f238c1>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd\n\nBUG: memory leak\nunreferenced object 0xffff888017633a00 (size 240):\n  comm \"syz-executor392\", pid 264, jiffies 4294785440 (age 13.044s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\n    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 2d 6d 0c 80 88 ff ff  .........-m.....\n  backtrace:\n    [<000000002b1c4368>] __alloc_skb+0x229/0x320 net/core/skbuff.c:497\n    [<00000000143579a6>] alloc_skb include/linux/skbuff.h:1265 [inline]\n    [<00000000143579a6>] sock_omalloc+0xaa/0x190 net/core/sock.c:2596\n    [<00000000be626478>] msg_zerocopy_alloc net/core/skbuff.c:1294 [inline]\n    [<00000000be626478>]\n---truncated---										0.00043	2025-10-07 23:52:23	0.12889	1			9			0.0		5.5		2025-10-02 01:01:24	0.0	0.0

A\nsubsequent call to free_irq_cpu_rmap() will try to free this entry again\nleading to possible use after free.\n\nFix that by setting NULL to the array entry and checking that we have\nnon-zero at the array entry when iterating over the array in\nfree_irq_cpu_rmap().\n\nThe current code does not suffer from this since there are no cases\nwhere irq_set_affinity_notifier(irq, NULL) (note the NULL passed for the\nnotify arg) is called, followed by a call to free_irq_cpu_rmap() so we\ndon't hit and issue.

If we close both\nsockets without receiving FD, the sockets will be cleaned up by garbage\ncollection.\n\nThe garbage collection iterates such sockets and unlinks skb with\nFD from the socket's receive queue under the queue's lock.\n\nSo, there is a race where unix_stream_sendpage() could access an skb\nlocklessly that is being released by garbage collection, resulting in\nuse-after-free.\n\nTo avoid the issue, unix_stream_sendpage() must lock the peer's recv\nqueue.\n\nNote the issue does not exist in 6.5+ thanks to the recent sendpage()\nrefactoring.\n\nThis patch is originally written by Linus Torvalds.\n\nBUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffff988004dd6870\nPF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\nPF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\nPGD 0 P4D 0\nPREEMPT SMP PTI\nCPU: 4 PID: 297 Comm: garbage_uaf Not tainted 6.1.46 #1\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.0-0-gd239552ce722-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\nRIP: 0010:kmem_cache_alloc_node+0xa2/0x1e0\nCode: c0 0f 84 32 01 00 00 41 83 fd ff 74 10 48 8b 00 48 c1 e8 3a 41 39 c5 0f 85 1c 01 00 00 41 8b 44 24 28 49 8b 3c 24 48 8d 4a 40 <49> 8b 1c 06 4c 89 f0 65 48 0f c7 0f 0f 94 c0 84 c0 74 a1 41 8b 44\nRSP: 0018:ffffc9000079fac0 EFLAGS: 00000246\nRAX: 0000000000000070 RBX: 0000000000000005 RCX: 000000000001a284\nRDX: 000000000001a244 RSI: 0000000000400cc0 RDI: 000000000002eee0\nRBP: 0000000000400cc0 R08: 0000000000400cc0 R09: 0000000000000003\nR10: 0000000000000001 R11: 0000000000000000 R12: ffff888003970f00\nR13: 00000000ffffffff R14: ffff988004dd6800 R15: 00000000000000e8\nFS:  00007f174d6f3600(0000) GS:ffff88807db00000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: ffff988004dd6870 CR3: 00000000092be000 CR4: 00000000007506e0\nPKRU: 55555554\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n ? __die_body.cold+0x1a/0x1f\n ? page_fault_oops+0xa9/0x1e0\n ? fixup_exception+0x1d/0x310\n ? exc_page_fault+0xa8/0x150\n ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x22/0x30\n ? kmem_cache_alloc_node+0xa2/0x1e0\n ? __alloc_skb+0x16c/0x1e0\n __alloc_skb+0x16c/0x1e0\n alloc_skb_with_frags+0x48/0x1e0\n sock_alloc_send_pskb+0x234/0x270\n unix_stream_sendmsg+0x1f5/0x690\n sock_sendmsg+0x5d/0x60\n ____sys_sendmsg+0x210/0x260\n ___sys_sendmsg+0x83/0xd0\n ? kmem_cache_alloc+0xc6/0x1c0\n ? avc_disable+0x20/0x20\n ? percpu_counter_add_batch+0x53/0xc0\n ? alloc_empty_file+0x5d/0xb0\n ? alloc_file+0x91/0x170\n ? alloc_file_pseudo+0x94/0x100\n ? __fget_light+0x9f/0x120\n __sys_sendmsg+0x54/0xa0\n do_syscall_64+0x3b/0x90\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x69/0xd3\nRIP: 0033:0x7f174d639a7d\nCode: 28 89 54 24 1c 48 89 74 24 10 89 7c 24 08 e8 8a c1 f4 ff 8b 54 24 1c 48 8b 74 24 10 41 89 c0 8b 7c 24 08 b8 2e 00 00 00 0f 05 <48> 3d 00 f0 ff ff 77 33 44 89 c7 48 89 44 24 08 e8 de c1 f4 ff 48\nRSP: 002b:00007ffcb563ea50 EFLAGS: 00000293 ORIG_RAX: 000000000000002e\nRAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 0000000000000000 RCX: 00007f174d639a7d\nRDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 00007ffcb563eab0 RDI: 0000000000000007\nRBP: 00007ffcb563eb10 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 00000000ffffffff\nR10: 00000000004040a0 R11: 0000000000000293 R12: 00007ffcb563ec28\nR13: 0000000000401398 R14: 0000000000403e00 R15: 00007f174d72c000\n </TASK>										0.00024	2025-10-07 23:52:23	0.05206	1			2			0.0		7.0		2025-10-02 01:01:29	0.0	0.0		1

These stats are used in Byte Queue\nLimit (BQL) algorithms. The difference between these two stats tracks\nthe number of bytes currently sitting on the physical NIC. ibmvnic\nincreases the number of queued bytes though calls to\nnetdev_tx_sent_queue() in the drivers xmit function. When, VIOS reports\nthat it is done transmitting bytes, the ibmvnic device increases the\nnumber of completed bytes through calls to netdev_tx_completed_queue().\nIt is important to note that the driver batches its transmit calls and\nnum_queued is increased every time that an skb is added to the next\nbatch, not necessarily when the batch is sent to VIOS for transmission.\n\nUnlike other reset types, a NON FATAL reset will not flush the sub crq\ntx buffers. Therefore, it is possible for the batched skb array to be\npartially full. So if there is call to netdev_tx_reset_queue() when\nre-opening the device, the value of num_queued (0) would not account\nfor the skb's that are currently batched. Eventually, when the batch\nis sent to VIOS, the call to netdev_tx_completed_queue() would increase\nnum_completed to a value greater than the num_queued.

That function is\ninvoked by kworker, which doesn't take any signals. Because of that, it\ndoesn't really matter if we wait for completions in TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE\nor TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE state. However, it does matter to the hung task\ndetection checker!\n\nNormally we expect cancelations and completions to happen rather\nquickly. Some test cases, however, will exit the ring and park the\nowning task stopped (eg via SIGSTOP). If the owning task needs to run\ntask_work to complete requests, then io_ring_exit_work won't make any\nprogress until the task is runnable again. Hence io_ring_exit_work can\ntrigger the hung task detection, which is particularly problematic if\npanic-on-hung-task is enabled.\n\nAs the ring exit doesn't take signals to begin with, have it wait\ninterruptibly rather than uninterruptibly. io_uring has a separate\nstuck-exit warning that triggers independently anyway, so we're not\nreally missing anything by making this switch.										0.00024	2025-10-07 23:52:23	0.04968	1			5			0.0					0.0	0.0

Unfortunately, iolatency gets initialized in the former but\ndoesn't get cleaned up in the latter.\n\nThis is because, in non-error cases, the cleanup is performed by\ndel_gendisk() calling rq_qos_exit(), the assumption being that rq_qos\npolicies, iolatency being one of them, can only be activated once the disk\nis fully registered and visible. That assumption is true for wbt and iocost,\nbut not so for iolatency as it gets initialized before add_disk() is called.\n\nIt is desirable to lazy-init rq_qos policies because they are optional\nfeatures and add to hot path overhead once initialized - each IO has to walk\nall the registered rq_qos policies. So, we want to switch iolatency to lazy\ninit too. However, that's a bigger change. As a fix for the immediate\nproblem, let's just add an extra call to rq_qos_exit() in blkcg_exit_disk().\nThis is safe because duplicate calls to rq_qos_exit() become noop's.										0.00017	2025-10-08 23:20:31	0.02795	1			3			0.0		5.5		2025-10-08 02:01:21	0.0	0.0																		blk-iolatency: Fix memory leak on add_disk() failures

It can also be 0, if there\nis no owner of the other page half, and xdp_do_redirect() for this\nbuffer ran so far that it triggered a flush of the devmap/cpumap bulk\nqueue, and the consumers of those bulk queues also freed the buffer,\nall by the time xdp_do_redirect() returns the execution back to enetc.\n\nThis is the reason why enetc_flip_rx_buff() is called before\nxdp_do_redirect(), but there is a big flaw with that reasoning:\nenetc_flip_rx_buff() will set rx_swbd->page = NULL on both sides of the\nenetc_page_reusable() branch, and if xdp_do_redirect() returns an error,\nwe call enetc_xdp_free(), which does not deal gracefully with that.\n\nIn fact, what happens is quite special. The page refcounts start as 1.\nenetc_flip_rx_buff() figures they're reusable, transfers these\nrx_swbd->page pointers to a different rx_swbd in enetc_reuse_page(), and\nbumps the refcount to 2. When xdp_do_redirect() later returns an error,\nwe call the no-op enetc_xdp_free(), but we still haven't lost the\nreference to that page. A copy of it is still at rx_ring->next_to_alloc,\nbut that has refcount 2 (and there are no concurrent owners of it in\nflight, to drop the refcount). What really kills the system is when\nwe'll flip the rx_swbd->page the second time around. With an updated\nrefcount of 2, the page will not be reusable and we'll really leak it.\nThen enetc_new_page() will have to allocate more pages, which will then\neventually leak again on further errors from xdp_do_redirect().\n\nThe problem, summarized, is that we zeroize rx_swbd->page before we're\ncompletely done with it, and this makes it impossible for the error path\nto do something with it.\n\nSince the packet is potentially multi-buffer and therefore the\nrx_swbd->page is potentially an array, manual passing of the old\npointers between enetc_flip_rx_buff() and enetc_xdp_free() is a bit\ndifficult.\n\nFor the sake of going with a simple solution, we accept the possibility\nof racing with xdp_do_redirect(), and we move the flip procedure to\nexecute only on the redirect success path. By racing, I mean that the\npage may be deemed as not reusable by enetc (having a refcount of 0),\nbut there will be no leak in that case, either.\n\nOnce we accept that, we have something better to do with buffers on\nXDP_REDIRECT failure. Since we haven't performed half-page flipping yet,\nwe won't, either (and this way, we can avoid enetc_xdp_free()\ncompletely, which gives the entire page to the slab allocator).\nInstead, we'll call enetc_xdp_drop(), which will recycle this half of\nthe buffer back to the RX ring.										0.00024	2025-10-10 23:07:44	0.04938	1			4			0.0					0.0	0.0																		net: enetc: avoid buffer leaks on xdp_do_redirect() failure

Attempt to implicitly unmap d0's grant PTE ...\n  (XEN) d0v... Attempt to implicitly unmap d0's grant PTE ...\n\nAs of this writing, gntdev_grant_map structure's vma field (referred to\nas map->vma below) is mainly used for checking the start and end\naddresses of mappings. However, with split VMAs, these may change, and\nthere could be more than one VMA associated with a gntdev mapping.\nHence, remove the use of map->vma and rely on map->pages_vm_start for\nthe original start address and on (map->count << PAGE_SHIFT) for the\noriginal mapping size. Let the invalidate() and find_special_page()\nhooks use these.\n\nAlso, given that there can be multiple VMAs associated with a gntdev\nmapping, move the \"mmu_interval_notifier_remove(&map->notifier)\" call to\nthe end of gntdev_put_map, so that the MMU notifier is only removed\nafter the closing of the last remaining VMA.\n\nFinally, use an atomic to prevent inadvertent gntdev mapping re-use,\ninstead of using the map->live_grants atomic counter and/or the map->vma\npointer (the latter of which is now removed). This prevents the\nuserspace from mmap()'ing (with MAP_FIXED) a gntdev mapping over the\nsame address range as a previously set up gntdev mapping. This scenario\ncan be summarized with the following call-trace, which was valid prior\nto this commit:\n\n  mmap\n    gntdev_mmap\n  mmap (repeat mmap with MAP_FIXED over the same address range)\n    gntdev_invalidate\n      unmap_grant_pages (sets 'being_removed' entries to true)\n        gnttab_unmap_refs_async\n    unmap_single_vma\n    gntdev_mmap (maps the shared pages again)\n  munmap\n    gntdev_invalidate\n      unmap_grant_pages\n        (no-op because 'being_removed' entries are true)\n    unmap_single_vma (For PV domains, Xen reports that a granted page\n      is being unmapped and triggers a general protection fault in the\n      affected domain, if Xen was built with CONFIG_DEBUG)\n\nThe fix for this last scenario could be worth its own commit, but we\nopted for a single commit, because removing the gntdev_grant_map\nstructure's vma field requires guarding the entry to gntdev_mmap(), and\nthe live_grants atomic counter is not sufficient on its own to prevent\nthe mmap() over a pre-existing mapping.										0.00024	2025-10-10 23:07:44	0.04988	1			5			0.0					0.0	0.0																		xen/gntdev: Accommodate VMA splitting

Memory allocated for page table entries\nnot released during process termination. This issue can be reproduced by\na small program that allocates a large amount of memory. After several\nruns, you'll see that the amount of free memory has reduced and will\ncontinue to reduce after each run. All ARC CPUs are effected by this\nissue. The issue was introduced since the kernel stable release v5.15-rc1.\n\nAs described in commit d9820ff after switch pgtable_t back to struct\npage *, a pointer to \"struct page\" and appropriate functions are used to\nallocate and free a memory page for PTEs, but the pmd_pgtable macro hasn't\nchanged and returns the direct virtual address from the PMD (PGD) entry.\nThan this address used as a parameter in the __pte_free() and as a result\nthis function couldn't release memory page allocated for PTEs.\n\nFix this issue by changing the pmd_pgtable macro and returning pointer to\nstruct page.										0.00022	2025-10-07 23:52:21	0.04432	1			3			0.0					0.0	0.0

Otherwise, the replay code will\n  ignore them.  (BUG: ext4_fc_reserve_space() could violate this\n  requirement if called with a len of blocksize - 9 or blocksize - 8.\n  Fortunately, this doesn't seem to happen currently.)\n\n- tlvs must end at least 1 byte before the end of the block.  Otherwise\n  the replay code will consider them to be invalid.  This quirk\n  contributed to a bug (fixed by an earlier commit) where uninitialized\n  memory was being leaked to disk in the last byte of blocks.\n\nAlso, strangely these constraints don't apply to the replay code in\ne2fsprogs, which will accept any tlvs in the blocks (with no bounds\nchecks at all, but that is a separate issue...).\n\nGiven that this all seems to be a bug, let's fix it by just filling\nblocks with tlv entries in the natural way.\n\nNote that old kernels will be unable to replay fast-commit journals\ncreated by kernels that have this commit.										0.00023	2025-10-07 23:52:21	0.04836	1			4			0.0		5.5		2025-10-02 01:01:20	0.0	0.0
