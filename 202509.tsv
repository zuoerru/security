CVE-2025-54588	2025-09-03T00:15:30.067	2025-09-08T15:19:04.350	Envoy is an open source L7 proxy and communication bus designed for large modern service oriented architectures. Versions 1.34.0 through 1.34.4 and 1.35.0 contain a use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability in the DNS cache, causing abnormal process termination. The vulnerability is in Envoy's Dynamic Forward Proxy implementation, occurring when a completion callback for a DNS resolution triggers new DNS resolutions or removes existing pending resolutions.

An attacker can exploit the vulnerability in the following two scenarios: a victim visits a malicious website controlled by the attacker and the website redirect to the URL automatically, or a victim clicks on such a crafted link embedded on a legitimate website (e.g., in user-generated content). In both cases, the browser invokes Dive's custom URL handler (dive:), which launches the Dive app and processes the crafted URL, leading to arbitrary code execution on the victim’s machine. This vulnerability is caused by improper processing of custom url. This is fixed in version 0.9.4.	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

When the component is deployed to an environment, the customer has an option to configure the system to use a self-signed certificate. If the customer does not fully configure the system to leverage the trust database on the clients, it opens up the communication between clients and the server to man-in-the-middle attacks. 

It was discovered that certain parts of the documentation related to the configuration of SSL in Print Deploy were lacking, which could potentially contribute to a misconfiguration of the Print Deploy client installation. PaperCut strongly recommends to use valid certificates to secure installations and to follow the updated documentation to ensure the correct SSL configuration.

CVE-2025-9823	2025-09-03T15:15:49.247	2025-09-04T15:35:29.497	"SummaryA Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of another user’s session. This occurs because user-supplied input is reflected back in the server’s response without proper sanitization or escaping, potentially enabling malicious actions such as session hijacking, credential theft, or unauthorized actions in the application.

DetailsThe vulnerability resides in the “Tags” input field on the /s/ajax?action=lead:addLeadTags endpoint. Although the server applies sanitization before storing the data or returning it later, the payload is executed immediately in the victim’s browser upon reflection, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary JavaScript in the user’s session.

ImpactA Reflected XSS attack can have a significant impact, allowing attackers to steal sensitive user data like cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, manipulate the web page content, and essentially take control of a user's session within an application by executing malicious JavaScript code within the victim's browser, even if the server-side code is secure; essentially enabling them to perform actions as if they were the logged-in user.

CVE-2025-9824	2025-09-03T15:15:49.413	2025-09-04T15:35:29.497	"ImpactThe attacker can validate if a user exists by checking the time login returns. This timing difference can be used to enumerate valid usernames, after which an attacker could attempt brute force attacks.

PatchesThis vulnerability has been patched, implementing a timing-safe form login authenticator that ensures consistent response times regardless of whether a user exists or not.

Technical DetailsThe vulnerability was caused by different response times when:

  *  A valid username was provided (password hashing occurred)
  *  An invalid username was provided (no password hashing occurred)


The fix introduces a TimingSafeFormLoginAuthenticator that performs a dummy password hash verification even for non-existent users, ensuring consistent timing.

WorkaroundsNo workarounds are available. Users should upgrade to the patched version.

When a client initiates an HTTPS connection, the server performs the SSL handshake before assigning the connection to a processing slot. However, there is no specific timeout set for this phase, and the server uses the default socket timeout, which is effectively infinite. An attacker can exploit this by sending a malformed TLS ClientHello message with incorrect length values. This causes the server to wait indefinitely for data that never arrives, blocking the worker thread (Line) handling the connection. By opening multiple such connections, up to the server's maximum limit, the attacker can exhaust all available working threads, preventing the server from handling new, legitimate requests.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

In versions below 1.32.10 and 1.33.0 through 1.33.6, 1.34.0 through 1.34.4 and 1.35.0, insufficient Session Expiration in the Envoy OAuth2 filter leads to failed logout operations. When configured with __Secure- or __Host- prefixed cookie names, the filter fails to append the required Secure attribute to the Set-Cookie header during deletion. Modern browsers ignore this invalid request, causing the session cookie to persist. This allows a user to remain logged in after they believe they have logged out, creating a session hijacking risk on shared computers. The current implementation iterates through the configured cookie names to generate deletion headers but does not check for these prefixes. This failure to properly construct the deletion header means the user's session cookies are never removed by the browser, leaving the session active and allowing the next user of the same browser to gain unauthorized access to the original user's account and data. This is fixed in versions 1.32.10, 1.33.7, 1.34.5 and 1.35.1.	6.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N

CVE-2025-58056	2025-09-03T21:15:33.070	2025-09-08T16:46:36.847	Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for development of maintainable high performance protocol servers and clients. In versions 4.1.124.Final, and 4.2.0.Alpha3 through 4.2.4.Final, Netty incorrectly accepts standalone newline characters (LF) as a chunk-size line terminator, regardless of a preceding carriage return (CR), instead of requiring CRLF per HTTP/1.1 standards. When combined with reverse proxies that parse LF differently (treating it as part of the chunk extension), attackers can craft requests that the proxy sees as one request but Netty processes as two, enabling request smuggling attacks. This is fixed in versions 4.1.125.Final and 4.2.5.Final.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

media: venus: Fix OOB read due to missing payload bound check

Currently, The event_seq_changed() handler processes a variable number
of properties sent by the firmware. The number of properties is indicated
by the firmware and used to iterate over the payload. However, the
payload size is not being validated against the actual message length.

This can lead to out-of-bounds memory access if the firmware provides a
property count that exceeds the data available in the payload. Such a
condition can result in kernel crashes or potential information leaks if
memory beyond the buffer is accessed.

Fix this by properly validating the remaining size of the payload before
each property access and updating bounds accordingly as properties are
parsed.

This ensures that property parsing is safely bounded within the received
message buffer and protects against malformed or malicious firmware
behavior."

CVE-2025-38681	2025-09-04T16:15:35.747	2025-09-05T17:47:24.833	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/ptdump: take the memory hotplug lock inside ptdump_walk_pgd()

Memory hot remove unmaps and tears down various kernel page table regions
as required.  The ptdump code can race with concurrent modifications of
the kernel page tables.  When leaf entries are modified concurrently, the
dump code may log stale or inconsistent information for a VA range, but
this is otherwise not harmful.

But when intermediate levels of kernel page table are freed, the dump code
will continue to use memory that has been freed and potentially
reallocated for another purpose.  In such cases, the ptdump code may
dereference bogus addresses, leading to a number of potential problems.

To avoid the above mentioned race condition, platforms such as arm64,
riscv and s390 take memory hotplug lock, while dumping kernel page table
via the sysfs interface /sys/kernel/debug/kernel_page_tables.

Similar race condition exists while checking for pages that might have
been marked W+X via /sys/kernel/debug/kernel_page_tables/check_wx_pages
which in turn calls ptdump_check_wx().  Instead of solving this race
condition again, let's just move the memory hotplug lock inside generic
ptdump_check_wx() which will benefit both the scenarios.

Drop get_online_mems() and put_online_mems() combination from all existing
platform ptdump code paths."

fwnode_handle_put() on it.

a software fwnode, the software-node will be the primary node and
fwnode_handle_put() will put() it.

But for the software fwnode device_remove_software_node() will also put()
it leading to a double free:

net/sched: ets: use old 'nbands' while purging unused classes

Shuang reported sch_ets test-case [1] crashing in ets_class_qlen_notify()
after recent changes from Lion [2]. The problem is: in ets_qdisc_change()
we purge unused DWRR queues; the value of 'q->nbands' is the new one, and
the cleanup should be done with the old one. The problem is here since my
first attempts to fix ets_qdisc_change(), but it surfaced again after the
recent qdisc len accounting fixes. Fix it purging idle DWRR queues before
assigning a new value of 'q->nbands', so that all purge operations find a
consistent configuration:

 - old 'q->nbands' because it's needed by ets_class_find()
 - old 'q->nstrict' because it's needed by ets_class_is_strict()

comedi: fix race between polling and detaching

syzbot reports a use-after-free in comedi in the below link, which is
due to comedi gladly removing the allocated async area even though poll
requests are still active on the wait_queue_head inside of it. This can
cause a use-after-free when the poll entries are later triggered or
removed, as the memory for the wait_queue_head has been freed.  We need
to check there are no tasks queued on any of the subdevices' wait queues
before allowing the device to be detached by the `COMEDI_DEVCONFIG`
ioctl.

Tasks will read-lock `dev->attach_lock` before adding themselves to the
subdevice wait queue, so fix the problem in the `COMEDI_DEVCONFIG` ioctl
handler by write-locking `dev->attach_lock` before checking that all of
the subdevices are safe to be deleted.  This includes testing for any
sleepers on the subdevices' wait queues.  It remains locked until the
device has been detached.  This requires the `comedi_device_detach()`
function to be refactored slightly, moving the bulk of it into new
function `comedi_device_detach_locked()`.

Note that the refactor of `comedi_device_detach()` results in
`comedi_device_cancel_all()` now being called while `dev->attach_lock`

matter.

x86/fpu: Fix NULL dereference in avx512_status()

Problem
-------
With CONFIG_X86_DEBUG_FPU enabled, reading /proc/[kthread]/arch_status
causes a warning and a NULL pointer dereference.

This is because the AVX-512 timestamp code uses x86_task_fpu() but
doesn't check it for NULL. CONFIG_X86_DEBUG_FPU addles that function
for kernel threads (PF_KTHREAD specifically), making it return NULL.

The point of the warning was to ensure that kernel threads only access
task->fpu after going through kernel_fpu_begin()/_end(). Note: all
kernel tasks exposed in /proc have a valid task->fpu.

Solution
--------
One option is to silence the warning and check for NULL from
x86_task_fpu(). However, that warning is fairly fresh and seems like a
defense against misuse of the FPU state in kernel threads.

Instead, stop outputting AVX-512_elapsed_ms for kernel threads
altogether. The data was garbage anyway because avx512_timestamp is
only updated for user threads, not kernel threads.

If anyone ever wants to track kernel thread AVX-512 use, they can come
back later and do it properly, separate from this bug fix.

drm/xe/migrate: prevent infinite recursion

If the buf + offset is not aligned to XE_CAHELINE_BYTES we fallback to
using a bounce buffer. However the bounce buffer here is allocated on

naturally aligned to u8, and not XE_CACHELINE_BYTES. If the bounce
buffer is also misaligned we then recurse back into the function again,
however the new bounce buffer might also not be aligned, and might never
be until we eventually blow through the stack, as we keep recursing.

pNFS: Fix uninited ptr deref in block/scsi layout

The error occurs on the third attempt to encode extents. When function
ext_tree_prepare_commit() reallocates a larger buffer to retry encoding
extents, the ""layoutupdate_pages"" page array is initialized only after the
retry loop. But ext_tree_free_commitdata() is called on every iteration
and tries to put pages in the array, thus dereferencing uninitialized
pointers.

An additional problem is that there is no limit on the maximum possible
buffer_size. When there are too many extents, the client may create a
layoutcommit that is larger than the maximum possible RPC size accepted
by the server.

During testing, we observed two typical scenarios. First, one memory page
for extents is enough when we work with small files, append data to the
end of the file, or preallocate extents before writing. But when we fill
a new large file without preallocating, the number of extents can be huge,
and counting the number of written extents in ext_tree_encode_commit()
does not help much. Since this number increases even more between
unlocking and locking of ext_tree, the reallocated buffer may not be
large enough again and again."

This will cause the subsequent re-offload operation of this offline
CPU, which will pass the conditional check and the kthread_unpark()
will access invalid rdp's->nocb_cb_kthread pointer.

This commit therefore use rdp's->nocb_gp_kthread instead of

drbd: add missing kref_get in handle_write_conflicts

With `two-primaries` enabled, DRBD tries to detect ""concurrent"" writes
and handle write conflicts, so that even if you write to the same sector
simultaneously on both nodes, they end up with the identical data once
the writes are completed.

In handling ""superseeded"" writes, we forgot a kref_get,
resulting in a premature drbd_destroy_device and use after free,
and further to kernel crashes with symptoms.

Relevance: No one should use DRBD as a random data generator, and apparently
all users of ""two-primaries"" handle concurrent writes correctly on layer up.
That is cluster file systems use some distributed lock manager,
and live migration in virtualization environments stops writes on one node
before starting writes on the other node.

Which means that other than for ""test cases"",
this code path is never taken in real life.

FYI, in DRBD 9, things are handled differently nowadays.  We still detect
""write conflicts"", but no longer try to be smart about them.
We decided to disconnect hard instead: upper layers must not submit concurrent
writes. If they do, that's their fault."

loop: Avoid updating block size under exclusive owner

Syzbot came up with a reproducer where a loop device block size is
changed underneath a mounted filesystem. This causes a mismatch between
the block device block size and the block size stored in the superblock
causing confusion in various places such as fs/buffer.c. The particular
issue triggered by syzbot was a warning in __getblk_slow() due to
requested buffer size not matching block device block size.

Fix the problem by getting exclusive hold of the loop device to change
its block size. This fails if somebody (such as filesystem) has already
an exclusive ownership of the block device and thus prevents modifying
the loop device under some exclusive owner which doesn't expect it."					
CVE-2025-38710	2025-09-04T16:15:40.137	2025-09-05T17:47:24.833	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gfs2: Validate i_depth for exhash directories

A fuzzer test introduced corruption that ends up with a depth of 0 in
dir_e_read(), causing an undefined shift by 32 at:

  index = hash >> (32 - dip->i_depth);

As calculated in an open-coded way in dir_make_exhash(), the minimum
depth for an exhash directory is ilog2(sdp->sd_hash_ptrs) and 0 is
invalid as sdp->sd_hash_ptrs is fixed as sdp->bsize / 16 at mount time.

So we can avoid the undefined behaviour by checking for depth values
lower than the minimum in gfs2_dinode_in(). Values greater than the
maximum are already being checked for there.

Also switch the calculation in dir_make_exhash() to use ilog2() to
clarify how the depth is calculated.

net: hibmcge: fix rtnl deadlock issue

Currently, the hibmcge netdev acquires the rtnl_lock in
pci_error_handlers.reset_prepare() and releases it in
pci_error_handlers.reset_done().

However, in the PCI framework:
pci_reset_bus - __pci_reset_slot - pci_slot_save_and_disable_locked -
 pci_dev_save_and_disable - err_handler->reset_prepare(dev);

In pci_slot_save_and_disable_locked():
	list_for_each_entry(dev, &slot->bus->devices, bus_list) {

			continue;
		pci_dev_save_and_disable(dev);
		if (dev->subordinate)
			pci_bus_save_and_disable_locked(dev->subordinate);
	}

This will iterate through all devices under the current bus and execute
err_handler->reset_prepare(), causing two devices of the hibmcge driver
to sequentially request the rtnl_lock, leading to a deadlock.

Since the driver now executes netif_device_detach()
before the reset process, it will not concurrently with
other netdev APIs, so there is no need to hold the rtnl_lock now.

Therefore, this patch removes the rtnl_lock during the reset process and
adjusts the position of HBG_NIC_STATE_RESETTING to ensure
that multiple resets are not executed concurrently."

netfilter: ctnetlink: fix refcount leak on table dump

There is a reference count leak in ctnetlink_dump_table():
      if (res < 0) {
                nf_conntrack_get(&ct->ct_general); // HERE
                cb->args[1] = (unsigned long)ct;
                ...

While its very unlikely, its possible that ct == last.
If this happens, then the refcount of ct was already incremented.
This 2nd increment is never undone.

This prevents the conntrack object from being released, which in turn
keeps prevents cnet->count from dropping back to 0.

This will then block the netns dismantle (or conntrack rmmod) as
nf_conntrack_cleanup_net_list() will wait forever.

This can be reproduced by running conntrack_resize.sh selftest in a loop.
It takes ~20 minutes for me on a preemptible kernel on average before
I see a runaway kworker spinning in nf_conntrack_cleanup_net_list.

One fix would to change this to:
        if (res < 0) {
		if (ct != last)
	                nf_conntrack_get(&ct->ct_general);

But this reference counting isn't needed in the first place.
We can just store a cookie value instead.

A followup patch will do the same for ctnetlink_exp_dump_table,
it looks to me as if this has the same problem and like
ctnetlink_dump_table, we only need a 'skip hint', not the actual
object so we can apply the same cookie strategy there as well."

habanalabs: fix UAF in export_dmabuf()

As soon as we'd inserted a file reference into descriptor table, another
thread could close it.  That's fine for the case when all we are doing is
returning that descriptor to userland (it's a race, but it's a userland
race and there's nothing the kernel can do about it).  However, if we
follow fd_install() with any kind of access to objects that would be
destroyed on close (be it the struct file itself or anything destroyed
by its ->release()), we have a UAF.

dma_buf_fd() is a combination of reserving a descriptor and fd_install().
habanalabs export_dmabuf() calls it and then proceeds to access the
objects destroyed on close.  In particular, it grabs an extra reference to
another struct file that will be dropped as part of ->release() for ours;
that ""will be"" is actually ""might have already been"".

Fix that by reserving descriptor before anything else and do fd_install()
only when everything had been set up.  As a side benefit, we no longer
have the failure exit with file already created, but reference to
underlying file (as well as ->dmabuf_export_cnt, etc.) not grabbed yet;
unlike dma_buf_fd(), fd_install() can't fail."

netlink: avoid infinite retry looping in netlink_unicast()

netlink_attachskb() checks for the socket's read memory allocation
constraints. Firstly, it has:

  rmem < READ_ONCE(sk->sk_rcvbuf)

to check if the just increased rmem value fits into the socket's receive
buffer. If not, it proceeds and tries to wait for the memory under:

  rmem + skb->truesize > READ_ONCE(sk->sk_rcvbuf)

The checks don't cover the case when skb->truesize + sk->sk_rmem_alloc is
equal to sk->sk_rcvbuf. Thus the function neither successfully accepts
these conditions, nor manages to reschedule the task - and is called in
retry loop for indefinite time which is caught as:

CVE-2025-38730	2025-09-04T16:15:43.167	2025-09-05T17:47:24.833	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/net: commit partial buffers on retry

Ring provided buffers are potentially only valid within the single
execution context in which they were acquired. io_uring deals with this
and invalidates them on retry. But on the networking side, if
MSG_WAITALL is set, or if the socket is of the streaming type and too
little was processed, then it will hang on to the buffer rather than
recycle or commit it. This is problematic for two reasons:

1) If someone unregisters the provided buffer ring before a later retry,
   then the req->buf_list will no longer be valid.

2) If multiple sockers are using the same buffer group, then multiple
   receives can consume the same memory. This can cause data corruption
   in the application, as either receive could land in the same
   userspace buffer.

Fix this by disallowing partial retries from pinning a provided buffer
across multiple executions, if ring provided buffers are used."

CVE-2025-58362	2025-09-05T00:15:32.717	2025-09-17T20:35:24.260	Hono is a Web application framework that provides support for any JavaScript runtime. Versions 4.8.0 through 4.9.5 contain a flaw in the getPath utility function which could allow path confusion and potential bypass of proxy-level ACLs (e.g. Nginx location blocks). The original implementation relied on fixed character offsets when parsing request URLs. Under certain malformed absolute-form Request-URIs, this could lead to incorrect path extraction depending on the application and environment. If proxy ACLs are used to protect sensitive endpoints such as /admin, this flaw could have allowed unauthorized access.

s390/mm: Do not map lowcore with identity mapping

Since the identity mapping is pinned to address zero the lowcore is always
also mapped to address zero, this happens regardless of the relocate_lowcore
command line option. If the option is specified the lowcore is mapped
twice, instead of only once.

This means that NULL pointer accesses will succeed instead of causing an
exception (low address protection still applies, but covers only parts).
To fix this never map the first two pages of physical memory with the
identity mapping."

The direct cause of this issue is that after smc_listen_out_connected(),
newclcsock->sk may be NULL since it will releases the smcsk. Therefore,
if the application closes the socket immediately after accept,
newclcsock->sk can be NULL. A possible execution order could be as
follows:

smc_listen_work                                 | userspace

gve: prevent ethtool ops after shutdown

A crash can occur if an ethtool operation is invoked
after shutdown() is called.

shutdown() is invoked during system shutdown to stop DMA operations
without performing expensive deallocations. It is discouraged to
unregister the netdev in this path, so the device may still be visible
to userspace and kernel helpers.

In gve, shutdown() tears down most internal data structures. If an
ethtool operation is dispatched after shutdown(), it will dereference
freed or NULL pointers, leading to a kernel panic. While graceful
shutdown normally quiesces userspace before invoking the reboot
syscall, forced shutdowns (as observed on GCP VMs) can still trigger
this path.

Fix by calling netif_device_detach() in shutdown().
This marks the device as detached so the ethtool ioctl handler
will skip dispatching operations to the driver."

ESI/MSI is a performance optimization feature that provides dedicated

Commit e46a28cea29a (""scsi: ufs: qcom: Remove the MSI descriptor abuse"")
brings a regression in ESI (Enhanced System Interrupt) configuration that
causes a null pointer dereference when Platform MSI allocation fails.

The issue occurs in when platform_device_msi_init_and_alloc_irqs() in
ufs_qcom_config_esi() fails (returns -EINVAL) but the current code uses
__free() macro for automatic cleanup free MSI resources that were never
successfully allocated.

net/sched: Fix backlog accounting in qdisc_dequeue_internal

This issue applies for the following qdiscs: hhf, fq, fq_codel, and
fq_pie, and occurs in their change handlers when adjusting to the new
limit. The problem is the following in the values passed to the
subsequent qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog call given a tbf parent:

   When the tbf parent runs out of tokens, skbs of these qdiscs will
   be placed in gso_skb. Their peek handlers are qdisc_peek_dequeued,
   which accounts for both qlen and backlog. However, in the case of
   qdisc_dequeue_internal, ONLY qlen is accounted for when pulling
   from gso_skb. This means that these qdiscs are missing a
   qdisc_qstats_backlog_dec when dropping packets to satisfy the
   new limit in their change handlers.

   One can observe this issue with the following (with tc patched to
   support a limit of 0):

   export TARGET=fq
   tc qdisc del dev lo root
   tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: tbf rate 8bit burst 100b latency 1ms
   tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 1000
   echo ''; echo 'add child'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo
   ping -I lo -f -c2 -s32 -W0.001 127.0.0.1 2>&1 >/dev/null
   echo ''; echo 'after ping'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo
   tc qdisc change dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 0
   echo ''; echo 'after limit drop'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo
   tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 2: parent 1:1 sfq
   echo ''; echo 'post graft'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo

   The second to last show command shows 0 packets but a positive
   number (74) of backlog bytes. The problem becomes clearer in the
   last show command, where qdisc_purge_queue triggers
   qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog with the positive backlog and causes an
   underflow in the tbf parent's backlog (4096 Mb instead of 0).

To fix this issue, the codepath for all clients of qdisc_dequeue_internal
has been simplified: codel, pie, hhf, fq, fq_pie, and fq_codel.
qdisc_dequeue_internal handles the backlog adjustments for all cases that
do not directly use the dequeue handler.

The old fq_codel_change limit adjustment loop accumulated the arguments to
the subsequent qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog call through the cstats field.
However, this is confusing and error prone as fq_codel_dequeue could also
potentially mutate this field (which qdisc_dequeue_internal calls in the
non gso_skb case), so we have unified the code here with other qdiscs."

tls: fix handling of zero-length records on the rx_list

Each recvmsg() call must process either

has already been decrypted (which may be the case for TLS 1.3 where
we don't know type until decryption) we queue the pending record

Queuing the skb to rx_list after zero-copy decrypt is not possible,
since in that case we decrypted directly to the user space buffer,
and we don't have an skb to queue (darg.skb points to the ciphertext
skb for access to metadata like length).

Only data records are allowed zero-copy, and we break the processing
loop after each non-data record. So we should never zero-copy and

comedi: Fix use of uninitialized memory in do_insn_ioctl() and do_insnlist_ioctl()

syzbot reports a KMSAN kernel-infoleak in `do_insn_ioctl()`.  A kernel
buffer is allocated to hold `insn->n` samples (each of which is an
`unsigned int`).  For some instruction types, `insn->n` samples are
copied back to user-space, unless an error code is being returned.  The
problem is that not all the instruction handlers that need to return
data to userspace fill in the whole `insn->n` samples, so that there is
an information leak.  There is a similar syzbot report for
`do_insnlist_ioctl()`, although it does not have a reproducer for it at
the time of writing.

One culprit is `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` which is used as the handler for
`INSN_READ` or `INSN_WRITE` instructions for subdevices that do not have
a specific handler for that instruction, but do have an `INSN_BITS`
handler.  For `INSN_READ` it only fills in at most 1 sample, so if
`insn->n` is greater than 1, the remaining `insn->n - 1` samples copied
to userspace will be uninitialized kernel data.

Another culprit is `vm80xx_ai_insn_read()` in the ""vm80xx"" driver.  It
never returns an error, even if it fails to fill the buffer.

Fix it in `do_insn_ioctl()` and `do_insnlist_ioctl()` by making sure
that uninitialized parts of the allocated buffer are zeroed before
handling each instruction.

Thanks to Arnaud Lecomte for their fix to `do_insn_ioctl()`.  That fix
replaced the call to `kmalloc_array()` with `kcalloc()`, but it is not
always necessary to clear the whole buffer."

Possible solutions include reducing the upper bound on the

The old code would just not attempt to request the IRQ if the

Currently the reader of set_ftrace_filter and set_ftrace_notrace just adds

that allocates a copy of the hash, the reader keeps the pointer to the
filter hashes. This is problematic because this pointer is static across

wait_on_buffer() returns to continue processing, the stack variable
is likely to be reclaimed. Consequently, during the end_buffer_read_sync()
process, calling put_bh() may result in stack overrun.

If the bh is not allocated on the stack, it belongs to a folio.  Freeing
a buffer head which belongs to a folio is done by drop_buffers() which
will fail to free buffers which are still locked.  So it is safe to call
put_bh() before __end_buffer_read_notouch()."

This issue was found by syzkaller.

The panic happens in br_dev_queue_push_xmit() once it receives a
corrupted skb with ETH header already pushed in linear data. When it
attempts the skb_push() call, there's not enough headroom and
skb_push() panics.

The corrupted skb is put on the queue by HSR layer, which makes a
sequence of unintended transformations when it receives a specific
corrupted HSR frame (with incomplete TAG).

Fix it by dropping and consuming frames that are not long enough to
contain both ethernet and hsr headers.

Alternative fix would be to check for enough headroom before skb_push()
in br_dev_queue_push_xmit().

In the reproducer, this is injected via AF_PACKET, but I don't easily
see why it couldn't be sent over the wire from adjacent network.

drm/amd/display: fix a Null pointer dereference vulnerability

[Why]
A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the AMD display driver's
(DC module) cleanup function dc_destruct().
When display control context (dc->ctx) construction fails
(due to memory allocation failure), this pointer remains NULL.
During subsequent error handling when dc_destruct() is called,
there's no NULL check before dereferencing the perf_trace member
(dc->ctx->perf_trace), causing a kernel null pointer dereference crash.

[How]

netfs: Fix unbuffered write error handling

If all the subrequests in an unbuffered write stream fail, the subrequest
collector doesn't update the stream->transferred value and it retains its
initial LONG_MAX value.  Unfortunately, if all active streams fail, then we
take the smallest value of { LONG_MAX, LONG_MAX, ... } as the value to set
in wreq->transferred - which is then returned from ->write_iter().

LONG_MAX was chosen as the initial value so that all the streams can be
quickly assessed by taking the smallest value of all stream->transferred -
but this only works if we've set any of them.

Fix this by adding a flag to indicate whether the value in
stream->transferred is valid and checking that when we integrate the
values.  stream->transferred can then be initialised to zero.

This was found by running the generic/750 xfstest against cifs with
cache=none.  It splices data to the target file.  Once (if) it has used up
all the available scratch space, the writes start failing with ENOSPC.
This causes ->write_iter() to fail.  However, it was returning
wreq->transferred, i.e. LONG_MAX, rather than an error (because it thought
the amount transferred was non-zero) and iter_file_splice_write() would
then try to clean up that amount of pipe bufferage - leading to an oops
when it overran.  The kernel log showed:

In serial8250_do_startup(), calling serial_port_out(port, UART_LCR,

[ 1211.244319] zpci: 061a:00:00.0: Event 0x2 reports an error for PCI function 0x61a
is a reliable indicator of the stated function entering error state
with PEC 2. Let me also point out that a kernel message like
[ 1211.244325] zpci: 061a:00:00.0: The ism driver bound to the device does not support error recovery
is a reliable indicator that the ISM function won't be auto-recovered
because the ISM driver currently lacks support for it.

On a technical level, without this synchronization, commands (inputs to
the FW) may be partially or fully overwritten (corrupted) by another CPU
trying to issue commands on the same function. There is hard evidence that
this can lead to DMB token values being used as DMB IOVAs, leading to
PEC 2 PCI events indicating invalid DMA. But this is only one of the
failure modes imaginable. In theory even completely losing one command
and executing another one twice and then trying to interpret the outputs
as if the command we intended to execute was actually executed and not
the other one is also possible.  Frankly, I don't feel confident about
providing an exhaustive list of possible consequences."

CVE-2025-36853	2025-09-08T14:15:34.173	2025-09-08T16:25:38.810	"A vulnerability (CVE-2025-21172) exists in msdia140.dll due to integer overflow and heap-based overflow.

 Per CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow, a heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().‍

 Per CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound, is when a product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This occurs when an integer value is incremented to a value that is too large to store in the associated representation. When this occurs, the value may become a very small or negative number.

  Per  CWE-416: Use After Free https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html , Use After Free is when a product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory ""belongs"" to the code that operates on the new pointer.

A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in versions prior to 2.1.9 that allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript, which is then executed in the context of a user's browser when the malicious link is clicked. This is a one-click XSS, meaning the victim only needs to click a crafted link — no further interaction is required. The application contains a stored XSS vulnerability due to insufficient filtering and escaping of user-supplied data inserted into link attributes. Malicious JavaScript code can be saved in the database along with the link and executed in the user’s browser when clicking the link, leading to arbitrary script execution within the context of the site.

CVE-2025-57815	2025-09-08T22:15:33.520	2025-09-10T18:43:41.397	Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. Prior to version 2.69.1, the Fides Admin UI login endpoint relies on a general IP-based rate limit for all API traffic and lacks specific anti-automation controls designed to protect against brute-force attacks. This could allow attackers to conduct credential testing attacks, such as credential stuffing or password spraying, which poses a risk to accounts with weak or previously compromised passwords. Version 2.69.1 fixes the issue. For organizations with commercial Fides Enterprise licenses, configuring Single Sign-On (SSO) through an OIDC provider (like Azure, Google, or Okta) is an effective workaround. When OIDC SSO is enabled, username/password authentication can be disabled entirely, which eliminates this attack vector. This functionality is not available for Fides Open Source users.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

Prior to version 2.69.1, the Fides Webserver API's built-in IP-based rate limiting is ineffective in environments with CDNs, proxies or load balancers. The system incorrectly applies rate limits based on directly connected infrastructure IPs rather than client IPs, and stores counters in-memory rather than in a shared store. This allows attackers to bypass intended rate limits and potentially cause denial of service. This vulnerability only affects deployments relying on Fides's built-in rate limiting for protection. Deployments using external rate limiting solutions (WAFs, API gateways, etc.) are not affected. Version 2.69.1 fixes the issue. There are no application-level workarounds. However, rate limiting may instead be implemented externally at the infrastructure level using a WAF, API Gateway, or similar technology.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

The component passes user-controlled href values directly to underlying anchor elements without protocol validation, URL sanitization, or security headers. This allows attackers to inject malicious URLs using dangerous protocols (javascript:, data:, file:) or redirect users to external malicious sites. While native HTML anchor elements present similar risks, UI component libraries bear additional responsibility for implementing security safeguards and providing clear risk documentation. The vulnerability enables XSS attacks, phishing campaigns, and open redirect exploits affecting applications that use Element Plus Link components with user-controlled or untrusted URL inputs.	6.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

Starting in version 1.2.0 and prior to version 1.12.4, the CoreDNS etcd plugin contains a TTL confusion vulnerability where lease IDs are incorrectly used as TTL values, enabling DNS cache pinning attacks. This effectively creates a DoS condition for DNS resolution of affected services. The `TTL()` function in `plugin/etcd/etcd.go` incorrectly casts etcd lease IDs (64-bit integers) to uint32 and uses them as TTL values. Large lease IDs become very large TTLs when cast to uint32. This enables cache pinning attacks. Version 1.12.4 contains a fix for the issue.	7.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H

If no event handlers executing system commands with uploaded filenames as parameters have been configured, this vulnerability does not have an impact. The vulnerability is patched in version 1.11.3. As a workaround, OctoPrint administrators who have event handlers configured that include any kind of filename based placeholders should disable those by setting their `enabled` property to `False` or unchecking the ""Enabled"" checkbox in the GUI based Event Manager. Alternatively, OctoPrint administrators should set `feature.enforceReallyUniversalFilenames` to `true` in `config.yaml` and restart OctoPrint, then vet the existing uploads and make sure to delete any suspicious looking files.

CVE-2025-58760	2025-09-09T20:15:49.563	2025-09-18T17:30:18.970	Tautulli is a Python based monitoring and tracking tool for Plex Media Server. The `/image` API endpoint in Tautulli v2.15.3 and earlier is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files from the application server's filesystem. In Tautulli, the `/image` API endpoint is used to serve static images from the application's data directory to users. This endpoint can be accessed without authentication, and its intended purpose is for server background images and icons within the user interface. Attackers can exfiltrate files from the application file system, including the `tautulli.db` SQLite database containing active JWT tokens, as well as the `config.ini` file which contains the hashed admin password, the JWT token secret, and the Plex Media Server token and connection details. If the password is cracked, or if a valid JWT token is present in the database, an unauthenticated attacker can escalate their privileges to obtain administrative control over the application. Version 2.16.0 contains a fix for the issue.	8.6	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2025-58761	2025-09-09T20:15:49.763	2025-09-18T17:23:40.120	Tautulli is a Python based monitoring and tracking tool for Plex Media Server. The `real_pms_image_proxy` endpoint in Tautulli v2.15.3 and prior is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files from the application server's filesystem. The `real_pms_image_proxy` is used to fetch an image directly from the backing Plex Media Server. The image to be fetched is specified through an `img` URL parameter, which can either be a URL or a file path. There is some validation ensuring that `img` begins with the prefix `interfaces/default/images` in order to be served from the local filesystem. However this can be bypassed by passing an `img` parameter which begins with a valid prefix, and then adjoining path traversal characters in order to reach files outside of intended directories. An attacker can exfiltrate files on the application file system, including the `tautulli.db` SQLite database containing active JWT tokens, as well as the `config.ini` file which contains the hashed admin password, the JWT token secret, and the Plex Media Server token and connection details. If the password is cracked, or if a valid JWT token is present in the database, an unauthenticated attacker can escalate their privileges to obtain administrative control over the application.

CVE-2025-58762	2025-09-09T20:15:49.950	2025-09-18T16:57:38.987	Tautulli is a Python based monitoring and tracking tool for Plex Media Server. In Tautulli v2.15.3 and earlier, an attacker with administrative access can use the `pms_image_proxy` endpoint to write arbitrary python scripts into the application filesystem. This leads to remote code execution when combined with the `Script` notification agent. If an attacker with administrative access changes the URL of the PMS to a server they control, they can then abuse the `pms_image_proxy` to obtain a file write into the application filesystem. This can be done by making a `pms_image_proxy` request with a URL in the `img` parameter and the desired file name in the `img_format` parameter. Tautulli then uses a hash of the desired metadata together with the `img_format` in order to construct a file path. Since the attacker controls `img_format` which occupies the end of the file path, and `img_format` is not sanitised, the attacker can then use path traversal characters to specify filename of their choosing. If the specified file does not exist, Tautaulli will then attempt to fetch the image from the configured PMS. Since the attacker controls the PMS, they can return arbitrary content in response to this request, which will then be written into the specified file. An attacker can write an arbitrary python script into a location on the application file system. The attacker can then make use of the built-in `Script` notification agent to run the local script, obtaining remote code execution on the application server. Users should upgrade to version 2.16.0 to receive a patch.	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

A command injection vulnerability in Tautulli v2.15.3 and prior allows attackers with administrative privileges to obtain remote code execution on the application server. This vulnerability requires the application to have been cloned from GitHub and installed manually. When Tautulli is cloned directly from GitHub and installed manually, the application manages updates and versioning through calls to the `git` command. In the code, this is performed through the `runGit` function in `versioncheck.py`. Since `shell=True` is passed to `subproces.Popen`, this call is vulnerable to subject to command injection, as shell characters within arguments will be passed to the underlying shell. A concrete location where this can be triggered is in the `checkout_git_branch` endpoint. This endpoint stores a user-supplied remote and branch name into the `GIT_REMOTE` and `GIT_BRANCH` configuration keys without sanitization. Downstream, these keys are then fetched and passed directly into `runGit` using a format string. Hence, code execution can be obtained by using `$()` interpolation in a command.

CVE-2025-59042	2025-09-09T23:15:37.403	2025-09-11T17:14:10.147	PyInstaller bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single package. Due to a special entry being appended to `sys.path` during the bootstrap process of a PyInstaller-frozen application, and due to the bootstrap script attempting to load an optional module for bytecode decryption while this entry is still present in `sys.path`, an application built with PyInstaller < 6.0.0 may be tricked by an unprivileged attacker into executing arbitrary python code when **all** of the following conditions are met. First, the application is built with PyInstaller < 6.0.0; both onedir and onefile mode are affected. Second, the optional bytecode encryption code feature was not enabled during the application build. Third, the attacker can create files/directories in the same directory where the executable is located. Fourth, the filesystem supports creation of files/directories that contain `?` in their name (i.e., non-Windows systems). Fifth, the attacker is able to determine the offset at which the PYZ archive is embedded in the executable. The attacker can create a directory (or a zip archive) next to the executable, with the name that matches the format used by PyInstaller's bootloader to transmit information about the location of PYZ archive to the bootstrap script. If this directory (or zip archive) contains a python module whose name matches the name used by the optional bytecode encryption feature, this module will be loaded and executed by the bootstrap script (in the absence of the real, built-in module that is available when the bytecode-encryption feature is enabled). This results in arbitrary code execution that requires no modification of the executable itself. If the executable is running with elevated privileges (for example, due to having the `setuid` bit set), the code in the injected module is also executed with the said elevated privileges, resulting in a local privilege escalation. PyInstaller 6.0.0 (f5adf291c8b832d5aff7632844f7e3ddf7ad4923) removed support for bytecode encryption; this effectively removes the described attack vector, due to the bootstrap script not attempting to load the optional module for bytecode-decryption anymore. PyInstaller 6.10.0 (cfd60b510f95f92cb81fc42735c399bb781a4739) reworked the bootstrap process to avoid (ab)using `sys.path` for transmitting location of the PYZ archive, which further eliminates the possibility of described injection procedure. If upgrading PyInstaller is not feasible, this issue can be worked around by ensuring proper permissions on directories containing security-sensitive executables (i.e., executables with `setuid` bit set) should mitigate the issue.					
CVE-2025-59044	2025-09-09T23:15:37.583	2025-09-11T17:14:10.147	Himmelblau is an interoperability suite for Microsoft Azure Entra ID and Intune. Himmelblau 0.9.x derives numeric GIDs for Entra ID groups from the group display name when himmelblau.conf `id_attr_map = name` (the default configuration). Because Microsoft Entra ID allows multiple groups with the same `displayName` (including end-user–created personal/O365 groups, depending on tenant policy), distinct directory groups can collapse to the same numeric GID on Linux. This issue only applies to Himmelblau versions 0.9.0 through 0.9.22. Any resource or service on a Himmelblau-joined host that enforces authorization by numeric GID (files/dirs, etc.) can be unintentionally accessible to a user who creates or joins a different Entra/O365 group that happens to share the same `displayName` as a privileged security group. Users should upgrade to 0.9.23, or 1.0.0 or later, to receive a patch. Group to GID mapping now uses Entra ID object IDs (GUIDs) and does not collide on same-name groups. As a workaround, use tenant policy hardening to restrict arbitrary group creation until all hosts are patched.	4.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

CVE-2025-59045	2025-09-10T16:15:41.737	2025-09-11T17:14:10.147	Stalwart is a mail and collaboration server. Starting in version 0.12.0 and prior to version 0.13.3, a memory exhaustion vulnerability exists in Stalwart's CalDAV implementation that allows authenticated attackers to cause denial-of-service by triggering unbounded memory consumption through recurring event expansion. An authenticated attacker can crash the Stalwart server by creating recurring events with large payloads and triggering their expansion through CalDAV REPORT requests. A single malicious request expanding 300 events with 1000-character descriptions can consume up to 2 GB of memory. The vulnerability exists in the `ArchivedCalendarEventData.expand` function, which processes CalDAV `REPORT` requests with event expansion. When a client requests recurring events in their expanded form using the `<C:expand>` element, the server stores all expanded event instances in memory without enforcing size limits. Users should upgrade to Stalwart version 0.13.3 or later to receive a fix. If immediate upgrading is not possible, implement memory limits at the container/system level; monitor server memory usage for unusual spikes; consider rate limiting CalDAV REPORT requests; and restrict CalDAV access to trusted users only.

CVE-2025-54123	2025-09-10T19:15:41.803	2025-09-17T21:17:53.460	Hoverfly is an open source API simulation tool. In versions 1.11.3 and prior, the middleware functionality in Hoverfly is vulnerable to command injection vulnerability at `/api/v2/hoverfly/middleware` endpoint due to insufficient validation and sanitization in user input. The vulnerability exists in the middleware management API endpoint `/api/v2/hoverfly/middleware`. This issue is born due to combination of three code level flaws: Insufficient Input Validation in middleware.go line 94-96; Unsafe Command Execution in local_middleware.go line 14-19; and Immediate Execution During Testing in hoverfly_service.go line 173. This allows an attacker to gain remote code execution (RCE) on any system running the vulnerable Hoverfly service. Since the input is directly passed to system commands without proper checks, an attacker can upload a malicious payload or directly execute arbitrary commands (including reverse shells) on the host server with the privileges of the Hoverfly process. Commit 17e60a9bc78826deb4b782dca1c1abd3dbe60d40 in version 1.12.0 disables the set middleware API by default, and subsequent changes to documentation make users aware of the security changes of exposing the set middleware API.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2025-59052	2025-09-10T21:15:37.283	2025-09-11T17:14:10.147	"Angular is a development platform for building mobile and desktop web applications using TypeScript/JavaScript and other languages. Angular uses a DI container (the ""platform injector"") to hold request-specific state during server-side rendering. For historical reasons, the container was stored as a JavaScript module-scoped global variable. When multiple requests are processed concurrently, they could inadvertently share or overwrite the global injector state. In practical terms, this can lead to one request responding with data meant for a completely different request, leaking data or tokens included on the rendered page or in response headers. As long as an attacker had network access to send any traffic that received a rendered response, they may have been able to send a large number of requests and then inspect the responses for information leaks. The APIs `bootstrapApplication`, `getPlatform`, and `destroyPlatform` were vulnerable and required SSR-only breaking changes.
The issue has been patched in all active release lines as well as in the v21 prerelease. Patched packages include `@angular/platform-server` 21.0.0-next.3, 20.3.0, 19.2.15, and 18.2.14 and `@angular/ssr` 21.0.0-next.3, 20.3.0, 19.2.16, and 18.2.21. Several workarounds are available. Disable SSR via Server Routes or builder options, remove any asynchronous behavior from custom `bootstrap` functions, remove uses of `getPlatform()` in application code, and/or ensure that the server build defines `ngJitMode` as false."

mm/kmemleak: avoid deadlock by moving pr_warn() outside kmemleak_lock

When netpoll is enabled, calling pr_warn_once() while holding
kmemleak_lock in mem_pool_alloc() can cause a deadlock due to lock
inversion with the netconsole subsystem.  This occurs because
pr_warn_once() may trigger netpoll, which eventually leads to
__alloc_skb() and back into kmemleak code, attempting to reacquire
kmemleak_lock.

This is the path for the deadlock.

mm/kmemleak: avoid soft lockup in __kmemleak_do_cleanup()

A soft lockup warning was observed on a relative small system x86-64
system with 16 GB of memory when running a debug kernel with kmemleak
enabled.

  watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#8 stuck for 33s! [kworker/8:1:134]

The test system was running a workload with hot unplug happening in
parallel.  Then kemleak decided to disable itself due to its inability to
allocate more kmemleak objects.  The debug kernel has its
CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK_MEM_POOL_SIZE set to 40,000.

The soft lockup happened in kmemleak_do_cleanup() when the existing
kmemleak objects were being removed and deleted one-by-one in a loop via a
workqueue.  In this particular case, there are at least 40,000 objects
that need to be processed and given the slowness of a debug kernel and the
fact that a raw_spinlock has to be acquired and released in
__delete_object(), it could take a while to properly handle all these
objects.

As kmemleak has been disabled in this case, the object removal and
deletion process can be further optimized as locking isn't really needed. 
However, it is probably not worth the effort to optimize for such an edge
case that should rarely happen.  So the simple solution is to call
cond_resched() at periodic interval in the iteration loop to avoid soft
lockup."

 WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 6963 at ../fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c:2168 btrfs_run_delayed_refs+0xfa/0x110 [btrfs]

And btrfs check doesn't report anything wrong related to the extent
tree.

[CAUSE]
The cause is a little complex, firstly the extent tree indeed doesn't
have the backref for 594526208.

The extent tree only have the following two backrefs around that bytenr
on-disk:

        item 65 key (594509824 METADATA_ITEM 0) itemoff 13880 itemsize 33
                refs 1 gen 197740 flags TREE_BLOCK
                tree block skinny level 0
                (176 0x7) tree block backref root CSUM_TREE
        item 66 key (594558976 METADATA_ITEM 0) itemoff 13847 itemsize 33
                refs 1 gen 197522 flags TREE_BLOCK
                tree block skinny level 0
                (176 0x7) tree block backref root CSUM_TREE

But the such missing backref item is not an corruption on disk, as the
offending delayed ref belongs to subvolume 934, and that subvolume is
being dropped:

        item 0 key (934 ROOT_ITEM 198229) itemoff 15844 itemsize 439
                generation 198229 root_dirid 256 bytenr 10741039104 byte_limit 0 bytes_used 345571328
                last_snapshot 198229 flags 0x1000000000001(RDONLY) refs 0
                drop_progress key (206324 EXTENT_DATA 2711650304) drop_level 2
                level 2 generation_v2 198229

And that offending tree block 594526208 is inside the dropped range of
that subvolume.  That explains why there is no backref item for that
bytenr and why btrfs check is not reporting anything wrong.

But this also shows another problem, as btrfs will do all the orphan
subvolume cleanup at a read-write mount.

So half-dropped subvolume should not exist after an RW mount, and
balance itself is also exclusive to subvolume cleanup, meaning we
shouldn't hit a subvolume half-dropped during relocation.

The root cause is, there is no orphan item for this subvolume.
In fact there are 5 subvolumes from around 2021 that have the same
problem.

It looks like the original report has some older kernels running, and
caused those zombie subvolumes.

Thankfully upstream commit 8d488a8c7ba2 (""btrfs: fix subvolume/snapshot
deletion not triggered on mount"") has long fixed the bug.

[ENHANCEMENT]
For repairing such old fs, btrfs-progs will be enhanced.

Considering how delayed the problem will show up (at run delayed ref
time) and at that time we have to abort transaction already, it is too
late.

Instead here we reject any half-dropped subvolume for reloc tree at the
earliest time, preventing confusion and extra time wasted on debugging
similar bugs."

bpf: Forget ranges when refining tnum after JSET

Syzbot reported a kernel warning due to a range invariant violation on
the following BPF program.

  0: call bpf_get_netns_cookie
  1: if r0 == 0 goto <exit>
  2: if r0 & Oxffffffff goto <exit>

The issue is on the path where we fall through both jumps.

That path is unreachable at runtime: after insn 1, we know r0 != 0, but
with the sign extension on the jset, we would only fallthrough insn 2
if r0 == 0. Unfortunately, is_branch_taken() isn't currently able to
figure this out, so the verifier walks all branches. The verifier then
refines the register bounds using the second condition and we end
up with inconsistent bounds on this unreachable path:

  1: if r0 == 0 goto <exit>
    r0: u64=[0x1, 0xffffffffffffffff] var_off=(0, 0xffffffffffffffff)
  2: if r0 & 0xffffffff goto <exit>
    r0 before reg_bounds_sync: u64=[0x1, 0xffffffffffffffff] var_off=(0, 0)
    r0 after reg_bounds_sync:  u64=[0x1, 0] var_off=(0, 0)

Improving the range refinement for JSET to cover all cases is tricky. We
also don't expect many users to rely on JSET given LLVM doesn't generate
those instructions. So instead of improving the range refinement for
JSETs, Eduard suggested we forget the ranges whenever we're narrowing
tnums after a JSET. This patch implements that approach."

rcu: Protect ->defer_qs_iw_pending from data race

On kernels built with CONFIG_IRQ_WORK=y, when rcu_read_unlock() is

The problem is that irq-work handlers run with interrupts enabled, which
means that rcu_preempt_deferred_qs_handler() could be interrupted,
and that interrupt handler might contain an RCU read-side critical
section, which might invoke rcu_read_unlock_special().  In the strict
KCSAN mode of operation used by RCU, this constitutes a data race on
the ->defer_qs_iw_pending field.

This commit therefore disables interrupts across the portion of the
rcu_preempt_deferred_qs_handler() that updates the ->defer_qs_iw_pending
field.  This suffices because this handler is not a fast path."

fs: Prevent file descriptor table allocations exceeding INT_MAX

When sysctl_nr_open is set to a very high value (for example, 1073741816
as set by systemd), processes attempting to use file descriptors near
the limit can trigger massive memory allocation attempts that exceed
INT_MAX, resulting in a WARNING in mm/slub.c:

  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 44 at mm/slub.c:5027 __kvmalloc_node_noprof+0x21a/0x288

This happens because kvmalloc_array() and kvmalloc() check if the
requested size exceeds INT_MAX and emit a warning when the allocation is
not flagged with __GFP_NOWARN.

Specifically, when nr_open is set to 1073741816 (0x3ffffff8) and a
process calls dup2(oldfd, 1073741880), the kernel attempts to allocate:
- File descriptor array: 1073741880 * 8 bytes = 8,589,935,040 bytes
- Multiple bitmaps: ~400MB
- Total allocation size: > 8GB (exceeding INT_MAX = 2,147,483,647)

Reproducer:
1. Set /proc/sys/fs/nr_open to 1073741816:
   # echo 1073741816 > /proc/sys/fs/nr_open

2. Run a program that uses a high file descriptor:
   #include <unistd.h>
   #include <sys/resource.h>

   int main() {
       struct rlimit rlim = {1073741824, 1073741824};
       setrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE, &rlim);
       dup2(2, 1073741880);  // Triggers the warning
       return 0;
   }

3. Observe WARNING in dmesg at mm/slub.c:5027

systemd commit a8b627a introduced automatic bumping of fs.nr_open to the
maximum possible value. The rationale was that systems with memory
control groups (memcg) no longer need separate file descriptor limits
since memory is properly accounted. However, this change overlooked
that:

1. The kernel's allocation functions still enforce INT_MAX as a maximum
   size regardless of memcg accounting
2. Programs and tests that legitimately test file descriptor limits can
   inadvertently trigger massive allocations
3. The resulting allocations (>8GB) are impractical and will always fail

systemd's algorithm starts with INT_MAX and keeps halving the value
until the kernel accepts it. On most systems, this results in nr_open
being set to 1073741816 (0x3ffffff8), which is just under 1GB of file
descriptors.

While processes rarely use file descriptors near this limit in normal
operation, certain selftests (like
tools/testing/selftests/core/unshare_test.c) and programs that test file
descriptor limits can trigger this issue.

Fix this by adding a check in alloc_fdtable() to ensure the requested
allocation size does not exceed INT_MAX. This causes the operation to
fail with -EMFILE instead of triggering a kernel warning and avoids the
impractical >8GB memory allocation request."

RDMA/siw: Fix the sendmsg byte count in siw_tcp_sendpages

Ever since commit c2ff29e99a76 (""siw: Inline do_tcp_sendpages()""),
we have been doing this:

static int siw_tcp_sendpages(struct socket *s, struct page **page, int offset,
                             size_t size)

        /* Calculate the number of bytes we need to push, for this page
         * specifically */
        size_t bytes = min_t(size_t, PAGE_SIZE - offset, size);
        /* If we can't splice it, then copy it in, as normal */
        if (!sendpage_ok(page[i]))
                msg.msg_flags &= ~MSG_SPLICE_PAGES;
        /* Set the bvec pointing to the page, with len $bytes */
        bvec_set_page(&bvec, page[i], bytes, offset);

        lock_sock(sk);
        /* Sendmsg with $size size (!!!) */
        rv = tcp_sendmsg_locked(sk, &msg, size);

This means we've been sending oversized iov_iters and tcp_sendmsg calls
for a while. This has a been a benign bug because sendpage_ok() always
returned true. With the recent slab allocator changes being slowly
introduced into next (that disallow sendpage on large kmalloc
allocations), we have recently hit out-of-bounds crashes, due to slight
differences in iov_iter behavior between the MSG_SPLICE_PAGES and
""regular"" copy paths:

(MSG_SPLICE_PAGES)
skb_splice_from_iter
  iov_iter_extract_pages
    iov_iter_extract_bvec_pages
      uses i->nr_segs to correctly stop in its tracks before OoB'ing everywhere
  skb_splice_from_iter gets a ""short"" read

(!MSG_SPLICE_PAGES)
skb_copy_to_page_nocache copy=iov_iter_count
 [...]
   copy_from_iter
        /* this doesn't help */
        if (unlikely(iter->count < len))
                len = iter->count;
          iterate_bvec
            ... and we run off the bvecs

correct byte count to tcp_sendmsg_locked."

btrfs: qgroup: fix race between quota disable and quota rescan ioctl

There's a race between a task disabling quotas and another running the
rescan ioctl that can result in a use-after-free of qgroup records from
the fs_info->qgroup_tree rbtree.

This happens as follows:

1) Task A enters btrfs_ioctl_quota_rescan() -> btrfs_qgroup_rescan();

2) Task B enters btrfs_quota_disable() and calls
   btrfs_qgroup_wait_for_completion(), which does nothing because at that

4) Task A enters qgroup_rescan_zero_tracking() which starts iterating

ACPI: APEI: send SIGBUS to current task if synchronous memory error not recovered

If a synchronous error is detected as a result of user-space process
triggering a 2-bit uncorrected error, the CPU will take a synchronous
error exception such as Synchronous External Abort (SEA) on Arm64. The
kernel will queue a memory_failure() work which poisons the related
page, unmaps the page, and then sends a SIGBUS to the process, so that
a system wide panic can be avoided.

However, no memory_failure() work will be queued when abnormal
synchronous errors occur. These errors can include situations like
invalid PA, unexpected severity, no memory failure config support,
invalid GUID section, etc. In such a case, the user-space process will
trigger SEA again.  This loop can potentially exceed the platform
firmware threshold or even trigger a kernel hard lockup, leading to a
system reboot.

Fix it by performing a force kill if no memory_failure() work is queued

After analysis, this is because the slow speed of loading the amdgpu
module leads to the long time occupation of the cpu and then the soft
deadlock.

When loading a module, module_frob_arch_sections() tries to figure out
the number of PLTs/GOTs that will be needed to handle all the RELAs. It
will call the count_max_entries() to find in an out-of-order date which
counting algorithm has O(n^2) complexity.

To make it faster, we sort the relocation list by info and addend. That
way, to check for a duplicate relocation, it just needs to compare with
the previous entry. This reduces the complexity of the algorithm to O(n
 log n), as done in commit d4e0340919fb (""arm64/module: Optimize module
load time by optimizing PLT counting""). This gives sinificant reduction
in module load time for modules with large number of relocations.

After applying this patch, the soft deadlock problem has been solved,
and the kernel starts normally without ""Call Trace"".

follows:

net/mlx5: HWS, fix complex rules rehash error flow

Moving rules from matcher to matcher should not fail.
However, if it does fail due to various reasons, the error flow
should allow the kernel to continue functioning (albeit with broken
steering rules) instead of going into series of soft lock-ups or
some other problematic behaviour.

Similar to the simple rules, complex rules rehash logic suffers
from the same problems. This patch fixes the error flow for moving
complex rules:
 - If new rule creation fails before it was even enqeued, do not
   poll for completion
 - If TIMEOUT happened while moving the rule, no point trying
   to poll for completions for other rules. Something is broken,
   completion won't come, just abort the rehash sequence.
 - If some other completion with error received, don't give up.
   Continue handling rest of the rules to minimize the damage.
 - Make sure that the first error code that was received will

bnxt_en: Fix lockdep warning during rmmod

The commit under the Fixes tag added a netdev_assert_locked() in
bnxt_free_ntp_fltrs().  The lock should be held during normal run-time
but the assert will be triggered (see below) during bnxt_remove_one()
which should not need the lock.  The netdev is already unregistered by
then.  Fix it by calling netdev_assert_locked_or_invisible() which will
not assert if the netdev is unregistered.

net: gso: Forbid IPv6 TSO with extensions on devices with only IPV6_CSUM

When performing Generic Segmentation Offload (GSO) on an IPv6 packet that
contains extension headers, the kernel incorrectly requests checksum offload
if the egress device only advertises NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM feature, which has
a strict contract: it supports checksum offload only for plain TCP or UDP
over IPv6 and explicitly does not support packets with extension headers.
The current GSO logic violates this contract by failing to disable the feature
for packets with extension headers, such as those used in GREoIPv6 tunnels.

This violation results in the device being asked to perform an operation
it cannot support, leading to a `skb_warn_bad_offload` warning and a collapse
of network throughput. While device TSO/USO is correctly bypassed in favor
of software GSO for these packets, the GSO stack must be explicitly told not
to request checksum offload.

Mask NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM, NETIF_F_TSO6 and NETIF_F_GSO_UDP_L4
in gso_features_check if the IPv6 header contains extension headers to compute
checksum in software.

The exception is a BIG TCP extension, which, as stated in commit
68e068cabd2c6c53 (""net: reenable NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM offload for BIG TCP packets""):
""The feature is only enabled on devices that support BIG TCP TSO.
The header is only present for PF_PACKET taps like tcpdump,
and not transmitted by physical devices.""

Fix it by checking for both VMAs and performing the check before the

mm/debug_vm_pgtable: clear page table entries at destroy_args()

The mm/debug_vm_pagetable test allocates manually page table entries for
the tests it runs, using also its manually allocated mm_struct.  That in
itself is ok, but when it exits, at destroy_args() it fails to clear those
entries with the *_clear functions.

The problem is that leaves stale entries.  If another process allocates an
mm_struct with a pgd at the same address, it may end up running into the
stale entry.  This is happening in practice on a debug kernel with
CONFIG_DEBUG_VM_PGTABLE=y, for example this is the output with some extra

Consider process A calling writepages() with WB_SYNC_NONE. In zoned mode or
for compressed writes, it locks several folios for delalloc and starts
writing them out. Let's call the last locked folio folio X. Suppose the
write range only partially covers folio X, leaving some pages dirty.
Process A calls btrfs_subpage_set_writeback() when building a bio. This
function call clears the TOWRITE tag of folio X, whose size = 8K and
the block size = 4K. It is following state.

   0     4K    8K
   |/////|/////|  (flag: DIRTY, tag: DIRTY)
   <-----> Process A will write this range.

Now suppose process B concurrently calls writepages() with WB_SYNC_ALL. It
calls tag_pages_for_writeback() to tag dirty folios with
PAGECACHE_TAG_TOWRITE. Since folio X is still dirty, it gets tagged. Then,
B collects tagged folios using filemap_get_folios_tag() and must wait for
folio X to be written before returning from writepages().

   0     4K    8K
   |/////|/////|  (flag: DIRTY, tag: DIRTY|TOWRITE)

However, between tagging and collecting, process A may call
btrfs_subpage_set_writeback() and clear folio X's TOWRITE tag.
   0     4K    8K
   |     |/////|  (flag: DIRTY|WRITEBACK, tag: DIRTY)

As a result, process B won't see folio X in its batch, and returns without
waiting for it. This breaks the WB_SYNC_ALL ordering requirement.

Fix this by using btrfs_subpage_set_writeback_keepwrite(), which retains
the TOWRITE tag. We now manually clear the tag only after the folio becomes
clean, via the xas operation."

bus: mhi: host: Detect events pointing to unexpected TREs

When a remote device sends a completion event to the host, it contains a
pointer to the consumed TRE. The host uses this pointer to process all of
the TREs between it and the host's local copy of the ring's read pointer.
This works when processing completion for chained transactions, but can
lead to nasty results if the device sends an event for a single-element
transaction with a read pointer that is multiple elements ahead of the
host's read pointer.

For instance, if the host accesses an event ring while the device is
updating it, the pointer inside of the event might still point to an old
TRE. If the host uses the channel's xfer_cb() to directly free the buffer
pointed to by the TRE, the buffer will be double-freed.

This behavior was observed on an ep that used upstream EP stack without
'commit 6f18d174b73d (""bus: mhi: ep: Update read pointer only after buffer
is written"")'. Where the device updated the events ring pointer before
updating the event contents, so it left a window where the host was able to
access the stale data the event pointed to, before the device had the
chance to update them. The usual pattern was that the host received an
event pointing to a TRE that is not immediately after the last processed
one, so it got treated as if it was a chained transaction, processing all
of the TREs in between the two read pointers.

This commit aims to harden the host by ensuring transactions where the
event points to a TRE that isn't local_rp + 1 are chained.

CVE-2025-39791	2025-09-11T17:15:45.517	2025-09-15T15:22:38.297	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm: dm-crypt: Do not partially accept write BIOs with zoned targets

Read and write operations issued to a dm-crypt target may be split
according to the dm-crypt internal limits defined by the max_read_size
and max_write_size module parameters (default is 128 KB). The intent is
to improve processing time of large BIOs by splitting them into smaller
operations that can be parallelized on different CPUs.

For zoned dm-crypt targets, this BIO splitting is still done but without
the parallel execution to ensure that the issuing order of write
operations to the underlying devices remains sequential. However, the
splitting itself causes other problems:

1) Since dm-crypt relies on the block layer zone write plugging to
   handle zone append emulation using regular write operations, the
   reminder of a split write BIO will always be plugged into the target
   zone write plugged. Once the on-going write BIO finishes, this
   reminder BIO is unplugged and issued from the zone write plug work.
   If this reminder BIO itself needs to be split, the reminder will be
   re-issued and plugged again, but that causes a call to a
   blk_queue_enter(), which may block if a queue freeze operation was
   initiated. This results in a deadlock as DM submission still holds
   BIOs that the queue freeze side is waiting for.

2) dm-crypt relies on the emulation done by the block layer using
   regular write operations for processing zone append operations. This
   still requires to properly return the written sector as the BIO
   sector of the original BIO. However, this can be done correctly only
   and only if there is a single clone BIO used for processing the
   original zone append operation issued by the user. If the size of a
   zone append operation is larger than dm-crypt max_write_size, then
   the orginal BIO will be split and processed as a chain of regular
   write operations. Such chaining result in an incorrect written sector
   being returned to the zone append issuer using the original BIO
   sector.  This in turn results in file system data corruptions using
   xfs or btrfs.

Fix this by modifying get_max_request_size() to always return the size
of the BIO to avoid it being split with dm_accpet_partial_bio() in
crypt_map(). get_max_request_size() is renamed to
get_max_request_sectors() to clarify the unit of the value returned
and its interface is changed to take a struct dm_target pointer and a
pointer to the struct bio being processed. In addition to this change,
to ensure that crypt_alloc_buffer() works correctly, set the dm-crypt
device max_hw_sectors limit to be at most
BIO_MAX_VECS << PAGE_SECTORS_SHIFT (1 MB with a 4KB page architecture).
This forces DM core to split write BIOs before passing them to
crypt_map(), and thus guaranteeing that dm-crypt can always accept an
entire write BIO without needing to split it.

This change does not have any effect on the read path of dm-crypt. Read
operations can still be split and the BIO fragments processed in
parallel. There is also no impact on the performance of the write path
given that all zone write BIOs were already processed inline instead of
in parallel.

This change also does not affect in any way regular dm-crypt block
devices."

x86/vmscape: Add conditional IBPB mitigation

VMSCAPE is a vulnerability that exploits insufficient branch predictor
isolation between a guest and a userspace hypervisor (like QEMU). Existing
mitigations already protect kernel/KVM from a malicious guest. Userspace
can additionally be protected by flushing the branch predictors after a
VMexit.

Since it is the userspace that consumes the poisoned branch predictors,
conditionally issue an IBPB after a VMexit and before returning to
userspace. Workloads that frequently switch between hypervisor and
userspace will incur the most overhead from the new IBPB.

This new IBPB is not integrated with the existing IBPB sites. For
instance, a task can use the existing speculation control prctl() to
get an IBPB at context switch time. With this implementation, the
IBPB is doubled up: one at context switch and another before running
userspace.

CVE-2025-58060	2025-09-11T18:15:34.787	2025-09-19T19:56:17.477	OpenPrinting CUPS is an open source printing system for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. In versions 2.4.12 and earlier, when the `AuthType` is set to anything but `Basic`, if the request contains an `Authorization: Basic ...` header, the password is not checked. This results in authentication bypass. Any configuration that allows an `AuthType` that is not `Basic` is affected.

Prior to version 4.8.1, when Flask-AppBuilder is configured to use OAuth, LDAP, or other non-database authentication methods, the password reset endpoint remains registered and accessible, despite not being displayed in the user interface. This allows an enabled user to reset their password and be able to create JWT tokens even after the user is disabled on the authentication provider. Users should upgrade to Flask-AppBuilder version 4.8.1 or later to receive a fix. If immediate upgrade is not possible, manually disable password reset routes in the application configuration; implement additional access controls at the web server or proxy level to block access to the reset my password URL; and/or monitor for suspicious password reset attempts from disabled accounts.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

CVE-2025-59053	2025-09-11T19:15:34.443	2025-09-15T15:22:38.297	AIRI is a self-hosted, artificial intelligence based Grok Companion. In v0.7.2-beta.2 in the `packages/stage-ui/src/components/MarkdownRenderer.vue` path, the Markdown content is processed using the useMarkdown composable, and the processed HTML is rendered directly into the DOM using v-html. An attacker creates a card file containing malicious HTML/JavaScript, then simply processes it using the highlightTagToHtml function (which simply replaces template tags without HTML escaping), and then directly renders it using v-html, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS). The project also exposes the Tauri API, which can be called from the frontend. The MCP plugin exposes a command execution interface function in `crates/tauri-plugin-mcp/src/lib.rs`. This allows arbitrary command execution. `connect_server` directly passes the user-supplied `command` and `args` parameters to `Command::new(command).args(args)` without any input validation or whitelisting. Thus, the previous XSS exploit could achieve command execution through this interface. v0.7.2-beta.3 fixes the issue.	9.6	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2025-59139	2025-09-12T14:15:41.940	2025-09-17T20:35:36.607	Hono is a Web application framework that provides support for any JavaScript runtime. In versions prior to 4.9.7, a flaw in the `bodyLimit` middleware could allow bypassing the configured request body size limit when conflicting HTTP headers were present. The middleware previously prioritized the `Content-Length` header even when a `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header was also included. According to the HTTP specification, `Content-Length` must be ignored in such cases. This discrepancy could allow oversized request bodies to bypass the configured limit. Most standards-compliant runtimes and reverse proxies may reject such malformed requests with `400 Bad Request`, so the practical impact depends on the runtime and deployment environment. If body size limits are used as a safeguard against large or malicious requests, this flaw could allow attackers to send oversized request bodies. The primary risk is denial of service (DoS) due to excessive memory or CPU consumption when handling very large requests. The implementation has been updated to align with the HTTP specification, ensuring that `Transfer-Encoding` takes precedence over `Content-Length`. The issue is fixed in Hono v4.9.7, and all users should upgrade immediately.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

CVE-2025-39792	2025-09-12T16:15:33.450	2025-09-15T15:21:42.937	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm: Always split write BIOs to zoned device limits

Any zoned DM target that requires zone append emulation will use the
block layer zone write plugging. In such case, DM target drivers must
not split BIOs using dm_accept_partial_bio() as doing so can potentially
lead to deadlocks with queue freeze operations. Regular write operations
used to emulate zone append operations also cannot be split by the
target driver as that would result in an invalid writen sector value
return using the BIO sector.

In order for zoned DM target drivers to avoid such incorrect BIO
splitting, we must ensure that large BIOs are split before being passed
to the map() function of the target, thus guaranteeing that the
limits for the mapped device are not exceeded.

dm-crypt and dm-flakey are the only target drivers supporting zoned
devices and using dm_accept_partial_bio().

In the case of dm-crypt, this function is used to split BIOs to the
internal max_write_size limit (which will be suppressed in a different
patch). However, since crypt_alloc_buffer() uses a bioset allowing only
up to BIO_MAX_VECS (256) vectors in a BIO. The dm-crypt device
max_segments limit, which is not set and so default to BLK_MAX_SEGMENTS
(128), must thus be respected and write BIOs split accordingly.

In the case of dm-flakey, since zone append emulation is not required,
the block layer zone write plugging is not used and no splitting of BIOs
required.

Modify the function dm_zone_bio_needs_split() to use the block layer
helper function bio_needs_zone_write_plugging() to force a call to
bio_split_to_limits() in dm_split_and_process_bio(). This allows DM
target drivers to avoid using dm_accept_partial_bio() for write
operations on zoned DM devices."

CVE-2025-39797	2025-09-12T16:15:34.137	2025-09-15T15:21:42.937	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfrm: Duplicate SPI Handling

The issue originates when Strongswan initiates an XFRM_MSG_ALLOCSPI
Netlink message, which triggers the kernel function xfrm_alloc_spi().
This function is expected to ensure uniqueness of the Security Parameter
Index (SPI) for inbound Security Associations (SAs). However, it can
return success even when the requested SPI is already in use, leading
to duplicate SPIs assigned to multiple inbound SAs, differentiated
only by their destination addresses.

This behavior causes inconsistencies during SPI lookups for inbound packets.
Since the lookup may return an arbitrary SA among those with the same SPI,
packet processing can fail, resulting in packet drops.

According to RFC 4301 section 4.4.2 , for inbound processing a unicast SA
is uniquely identified by the SPI and optionally protocol.

Reproducing the Issue Reliably:
To consistently reproduce the problem, restrict the available SPI range in
charon.conf : spi_min = 0x10000000 spi_max = 0x10000002
This limits the system to only 2 usable SPI values.
Next, create more than 2 Child SA. each using unique pair of src/dst address.
As soon as the 3rd Child SA is initiated, it will be assigned a duplicate
SPI, since the SPI pool is already exhausted.
With a narrow SPI range, the issue is consistently reproducible.
With a broader/default range, it becomes rare and unpredictable.

Current implementation:
xfrm_spi_hash() lookup function computes hash using daddr, proto, and family.
So if two SAs have the same SPI but different destination addresses, then
they will:
a. Hash into different buckets
b. Be stored in different linked lists (byspi + h)
c. Not be seen in the same hlist_for_each_entry_rcu() iteration.
As a result, the lookup will result in NULL and kernel allows that Duplicate SPI

Proposed Change:
xfrm_state_lookup_spi_proto() does a truly global search - across all states,
regardless of hash bucket and matches SPI and proto."

CVE-2025-58434	2025-09-12T18:15:34.847	2025-09-20T02:54:59.667	Flowise is a drag & drop user interface to build a customized large language model flow. In version 3.0.5 and earlier, the `forgot-password` endpoint in Flowise returns sensitive information including a valid password reset `tempToken` without authentication or verification. This enables any attacker to generate a reset token for arbitrary users and directly reset their password, leading to a complete account takeover (ATO). This vulnerability applies to both the cloud service (`cloud.flowiseai.com`) and self-hosted/local Flowise deployments that expose the same API. Commit 9e178d68873eb876073846433a596590d3d9c863 in version 3.0.6 secures password reset endpoints. Several recommended remediation steps are available. Do not return reset tokens or sensitive account details in API responses. Tokens must only be delivered securely via the registered email channel. Ensure `forgot-password` responds with a generic success message regardless of input, to avoid user enumeration. Require strong validation of the `tempToken` (e.g., single-use, short expiry, tied to request origin, validated against email delivery). Apply the same fixes to both cloud and self-hosted/local deployments. Log and monitor password reset requests for suspicious activity. Consider multi-factor verification for sensitive accounts.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

usb: dwc3: Remove WARN_ON for device endpoint command timeouts

This commit addresses a rarely observed endpoint command timeout
which causes kernel panic due to warn when 'panic_on_warn' is enabled
and unnecessary call trace prints when 'panic_on_warn' is disabled.
It is seen during fast software-controlled connect/disconnect testcases.
The following is one such endpoint command timeout that we observed:

1. Connect
   =======
->dwc3_thread_interrupt
 ->dwc3_ep0_interrupt
  ->configfs_composite_setup
   ->composite_setup
    ->usb_ep_queue
     ->dwc3_gadget_ep0_queue
      ->__dwc3_gadget_ep0_queue
       ->__dwc3_ep0_do_control_data
        ->dwc3_send_gadget_ep_cmd

2. Disconnect
   ==========
->dwc3_thread_interrupt
 ->dwc3_gadget_disconnect_interrupt
  ->dwc3_ep0_reset_state
   ->dwc3_ep0_end_control_data
    ->dwc3_send_gadget_ep_cmd

In the issue scenario, in Exynos platforms, we observed that control
transfers for the previous connect have not yet been completed and end
transfer command sent as a part of the disconnect sequence and
processing of USB_ENDPOINT_HALT feature request from the host timeout.
This maybe an expected scenario since the controller is processing EP
commands sent as a part of the previous connect. It maybe better to
remove WARN_ON in all places where device endpoint commands are sent to
avoid unnecessary kernel panic due to warn."

This commit fixes a kernel oops because of a write in some read-only memory:

The following line defines a pointer that point to a char buffer stored

	char *pvs_name = ""speedXX-pvsXX-vXX"";

This pointer is meant to hold a template ""speedXX-pvsXX-vXX"" where the
XX values get overridden by the qcom_cpufreq_krait_name_version function. Since
the template is actually stored in read-only memory, when the function
executes the following call we get an oops:

	snprintf(*pvs_name, sizeof(""speedXX-pvsXX-vXX""), ""speed%d-pvs%d-v%d"",
		 speed, pvs, pvs_ver);

To fix this issue, we instead store the template name onto the stack by
using the following syntax:

	char pvs_name_buffer[] = ""speedXX-pvsXX-vXX"";

Because the `pvs_name` needs to be able to be assigned to NULL, the
template buffer is stored in the pvs_name_buffer and not under the
pvs_name variable."

android: binder: stop saving a pointer to the VMA

Do not record a pointer to a VMA outside of the mmap_lock for later use. 
This is unsafe and there are a number of failure paths *after* the
recorded VMA pointer may be freed during setup.  There is no callback to
the driver to clear the saved pointer from generic mm code.  Furthermore,
the VMA pointer may become stale if any number of VMA operations end up
freeing the VMA so saving it was fragile to being with.

Instead, change the binder_alloc struct to record the start address of the
VMA and use vma_lookup() to get the vma when needed.  Add lockdep
mmap_lock checks on updates to the vma pointer to ensure the lock is held
and depend on that lock for synchronization of readers and writers - which

NFSD: fix use-after-free on source server when doing inter-server copy

Use-after-free occurred when the laundromat tried to free expired
cpntf_state entry on the s2s_cp_stateids list after inter-server
copy completed. The sc_cp_list that the expired copy state was
inserted on was already freed.

When COPY completes, the Linux client normally sends LOCKU(lock_state x),
FREE_STATEID(lock_state x) and CLOSE(open_state y) to the source server.
The nfs4_put_stid call from nfsd4_free_stateid cleans up the copy state
from the s2s_cp_stateids list before freeing the lock state's stid.

However, sometimes the CLOSE was sent before the FREE_STATEID request.
When this happens, the nfsd4_close_open_stateid call from nfsd4_close
frees all lock states on its st_locks list without cleaning up the copy
state on the sc_cp_list list. When the time the FREE_STATEID arrives the
server returns BAD_STATEID since the lock state was freed. This causes
the use-after-free error to occur when the laundromat tries to free
the expired cpntf_state.

This patch adds a call to nfs4_free_cpntf_statelist in
nfsd4_close_open_stateid to clean up the copy state before calling
free_ol_stateid_reaplist to free the lock state's stid on the reaplist."

__skb_pull l2 header and arrive again at skb->len == 0.

The problem is that the synthetic event field ""char file[]"" will read
the value given to it as a string without any memory checks to make sure
the address is valid. The above example will pass in the user space
address and the sythetic event code will happily call strlen() on it
and then strscpy() where either one will cause an oops when accessing
user space addresses.

Use the helper functions from trace_kprobe and trace_eprobe that can
read strings safely (and actually succeed when the address is from user

CVE-2022-50257	2025-09-15T14:15:36.487	2025-09-15T15:22:27.090	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xen/gntdev: Prevent leaking grants

Prior to this commit, if a grant mapping operation failed partially,
some of the entries in the map_ops array would be invalid, whereas all
of the entries in the kmap_ops array would be valid. This in turn would
cause the following logic in gntdev_map_grant_pages to become invalid:

  for (i = 0; i < map->count; i++) {
    if (map->map_ops[i].status == GNTST_okay) {
      map->unmap_ops[i].handle = map->map_ops[i].handle;
      if (!use_ptemod)
        alloced++;
    }
    if (use_ptemod) {
      if (map->kmap_ops[i].status == GNTST_okay) {
        if (map->map_ops[i].status == GNTST_okay)
          alloced++;
        map->kunmap_ops[i].handle = map->kmap_ops[i].handle;
      }
    }
  }
  ...
  atomic_add(alloced, &map->live_grants);

Assume that use_ptemod is true (i.e., the domain mapping the granted
pages is a paravirtualized domain). In the code excerpt above, note that
the ""alloced"" variable is only incremented when both kmap_ops[i].status
and map_ops[i].status are set to GNTST_okay (i.e., both mapping
operations are successful).  However, as also noted above, there are
cases where a grant mapping operation fails partially, breaking the
assumption of the code excerpt above.

The aforementioned causes map->live_grants to be incorrectly set. In
some cases, all of the map_ops mappings fail, but all of the kmap_ops
mappings succeed, meaning that live_grants may remain zero. This in turn
makes it impossible to unmap the successfully grant-mapped pages pointed
to by kmap_ops, because unmap_grant_pages has the following snippet of
code at its beginning:

  if (atomic_read(&map->live_grants) == 0)
    return; /* Nothing to do */

In other cases where only some of the map_ops mappings fail but all
kmap_ops mappings succeed, live_grants is made positive, but when the
user requests unmapping the grant-mapped pages, __unmap_grant_pages_done
will then make map->live_grants negative, because the latter function
does not check if all of the pages that were requested to be unmapped
were actually unmapped, and the same function unconditionally subtracts
""data->count"" (i.e., a value that can be greater than map->live_grants)
from map->live_grants. The side effects of a negative live_grants value
have not been studied.

The net effect of all of this is that grant references are leaked in one
of the above conditions. In Qubes OS v4.1 (which uses Xen's grant
mechanism extensively for X11 GUI isolation), this issue manifests
itself with warning messages like the following to be printed out by the
Linux kernel in the VM that had granted pages (that contain X11 GUI
window data) to dom0: ""g.e. 0x1234 still pending"", especially after the
user rapidly resizes GUI VM windows (causing some grant-mapping
operations to partially or completely fail, due to the fact that the VM
unshares some of the pages as part of the window resizing, making the
pages impossible to grant-map from dom0).

The fix for this issue involves counting all successful map_ops and
kmap_ops mappings separately, and then adding the sum to live_grants.
During unmapping, only the number of successfully unmapped grants is
subtracted from live_grants. The code is also modified to check for
negative live_grants values after the subtraction and warn the user."

CVE-2022-50260	2025-09-15T14:15:36.873	2025-09-15T15:22:27.090	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm: Make .remove and .shutdown HW shutdown consistent

Drivers' .remove and .shutdown callbacks are executed on different code
paths. The former is called when a device is removed from the bus, while
the latter is called at system shutdown time to quiesce the device.

This means that some overlap exists between the two, because both have to
take care of properly shutting down the hardware. But currently the logic
used in these two callbacks isn't consistent in msm drivers, which could
lead to kernel panic.

For example, on .remove the component is deleted and its .unbind callback
leads to the hardware being shutdown but only if the DRM device has been
marked as registered.

That check doesn't exist in the .shutdown logic and this can lead to the
driver calling drm_atomic_helper_shutdown() for a DRM device that hasn't
been properly initialized.

A situation like this can happen if drivers for expected sub-devices fail
to probe, since the .bind callback will never be executed. If that is the
case, drm_atomic_helper_shutdown() will attempt to take mutexes that are
only initialized if drm_mode_config_init() is called during a device bind.

This bug was attempted to be fixed in commit 623f279c7781 (""drm/msm: fix
shutdown hook in case GPU components failed to bind""), but unfortunately
it still happens in some cases as the one mentioned above, i.e:

  systemd-shutdown[1]: Powering off.

ROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,
which manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed. A
proposed warning in clang aims to catch these at compile time, which
reveals:

igb: Fix igb_down hung on surprise removal

In a setup where a Thunderbolt hub connects to Ethernet and a display
through USB Type-C, users may experience a hung task timeout when they
remove the cable between the PC and the Thunderbolt hub.
This is because the igb_down function is called multiple times when
the Thunderbolt hub is unplugged. For example, the igb_io_error_detected
triggers the first call, and the igb_remove triggers the second call.
The second call to igb_down will block at napi_synchronize.

mm: fix zswap writeback race condition

The zswap writeback mechanism can cause a race condition resulting in
memory corruption, where a swapped out page gets swapped in with data that
was written to a different page.

The race unfolds like this:
1. a page with data A and swap offset X is stored in zswap
2. page A is removed off the LRU by zpool driver for writeback in
   zswap-shrink work, data for A is mapped by zpool driver
3. user space program faults and invalidates page entry A, offset X is
   considered free
4. kswapd stores page B at offset X in zswap (zswap could also be
   full, if so, page B would then be IOed to X, then skip step 5.)
5. entry A is replaced by B in tree->rbroot, this doesn't affect the
   local reference held by zswap-shrink work
6. zswap-shrink work writes back A at X, and frees zswap entry A
7. swapin of slot X brings A in memory instead of B

The fix:
Once the swap page cache has been allocated (case ZSWAP_SWAPCACHE_NEW),
zswap-shrink work just checks that the local zswap_entry reference is
still the same as the one in the tree.  If it's not the same it means that
it's either been invalidated or replaced, in both cases the writeback is
aborted because the local entry contains stale data.

Reproducer:
I originally found this by running `stress` overnight to validate my work
on the zswap writeback mechanism, it manifested after hours on my test
machine.  The key to make it happen is having zswap writebacks, so
whatever setup pumps /sys/kernel/debug/zswap/written_back_pages should do
the trick.

In order to reproduce this faster on a vm, I setup a system with ~100M of
available memory and a 500M swap file, then running `stress --vm 1
--vm-bytes 300000000 --vm-stride 4000` makes it happen in matter of tens
of minutes.  One can speed things up even more by swinging
/sys/module/zswap/parameters/max_pool_percent up and down between, say, 20
and 1; this makes it reproduce in tens of seconds.  It's crucial to set
`--vm-stride` to something other than 4096 otherwise `stress` won't
realize that memory has been corrupted because all pages would have the
same data."

btrfs: exit gracefully if reloc roots don't match

[BUG]
Syzbot reported a crash that an ASSERT() got triggered inside
prepare_to_merge().

[CAUSE]
The root cause of the triggered ASSERT() is we can have a race between
quota tree creation and relocation.

This leads us to create a duplicated quota tree in the
btrfs_read_fs_root() path, and since it's treated as fs tree, it would
have ROOT_SHAREABLE flag, causing us to create a reloc tree for it.

The bug itself is fixed by a dedicated patch for it, but this already
taught us the ASSERT() is not something straightforward for
developers.

[ENHANCEMENT]
Instead of using an ASSERT(), let's handle it gracefully and output
extra info about the mismatch reloc roots to help debug.

Also with the above ASSERT() removed, we can trigger ASSERT(0)s inside
merge_reloc_roots() later.
Also replace those ASSERT(0)s with WARN_ON()s."

As part of fixing the allocation of the buffer for SVE state when changing

Unfortunately this reallocation is done prior to writing the new vector
length to the task struct, meaning the allocation is done with the old
vector length and can lead to memory corruption due to an undersized buffer
being used.

Move the update of the vector length before the allocation to ensure that
the new vector length is taken into account.

skbuff: Fix a race between coalescing and releasing SKBs

Commit 1effe8ca4e34 (""skbuff: fix coalescing for page_pool fragment
recycling"") allowed coalescing to proceed with non page pool page and page
pool page when @from is cloned, i.e.

to->pp_recycle    --> false
from->pp_recycle  --> true
skb_cloned(from)  --> true

However, it actually requires skb_cloned(@from) to hold true until
coalescing finishes in this situation. If the other cloned SKB is
released while the merging is in process, from_shinfo->nr_frags will be
set to 0 toward the end of the function, causing the increment of frag
page _refcount to be unexpectedly skipped resulting in inconsistent
reference counts. Later when SKB(@to) is released, it frees the page
directly even though the page pool page is still in use, leading to
use-after-free or double-free errors. So it should be prohibited.

The double-free error message below prompted us to investigate:

btrfs: fix use-after-free of new block group that became unused

If a task creates a new block group and that block group becomes unused
before we finish its creation, at btrfs_create_pending_block_groups(),
then when btrfs_mark_bg_unused() is called against the block group, we
assume that the block group is currently in the list of block groups to
reclaim, and we move it out of the list of new block groups and into the
list of unused block groups. This has two consequences:

1) We move it out of the list of new block groups associated to the
   current transaction. So the block group creation is not finished and
   if we attempt to delete the bg because it's unused, we will not find
   the block group item in the extent tree (or the new block group tree),
   its device extent items in the device tree etc, resulting in the
   deletion to fail due to the missing items;

2) We don't increment the reference count on the block group when we
   move it to the list of unused block groups, because we assumed the
   block group was on the list of block groups to reclaim, and in that
   case it already has the correct reference count. However the block
   group was on the list of new block groups, in which case no extra
   reference was taken because it's local to the current task. This
   later results in doing an extra reference count decrement when
   removing the block group from the unused list, eventually leading the
   reference count to 0.

This second case was caught when running generic/297 from fstests, which
produced the following assertion failure and stack trace:

net: openvswitch: fix race on port output

assume the following setup on a single machine:
1. An openvswitch instance with one bridge and default flows
2. two network namespaces ""server"" and ""client""
3. two ovs interfaces ""server"" and ""client"" on the bridge
4. for each ovs interface a veth pair with a matching name and 32 rx and
   tx queues
5. move the ends of the veth pairs to the respective network namespaces
6. assign ip addresses to each of the veth ends in the namespaces (needs
   to be the same subnet)
7. start some http server on the server network namespace
8. test if a client in the client namespace can reach the http server

when following the actions below the host has a chance of getting a cpu
stuck in a infinite loop:
1. send a large amount of parallel requests to the http server (around
   3000 curls should work)
2. in parallel delete the network namespace (do not delete interfaces or
   stop the server, just kill the namespace)

there is a low chance that this will cause the below kernel cpu stuck
message. If this does not happen just retry.
Below there is also the output of bpftrace for the functions mentioned
in the output.

The series of events happening here is:
1. the network namespace is deleted calling
   `unregister_netdevice_many_notify` somewhere in the process
2. this sets first `NETREG_UNREGISTERING` on both ends of the veth and
   then runs `synchronize_net`
3. it then calls `call_netdevice_notifiers` with `NETDEV_UNREGISTER`
4. this is then handled by `dp_device_event` which calls
   `ovs_netdev_detach_dev` (if a vport is found, which is the case for
   the veth interface attached to ovs)
5. this removes the rx_handlers of the device but does not prevent
   packages to be sent to the device
6. `dp_device_event` then queues the vport deletion to work in
   background as a ovs_lock is needed that we do not hold in the
   unregistration path
7. `unregister_netdevice_many_notify` continues to call
   `netdev_unregister_kobject` which sets `real_num_tx_queues` to 0
8. port deletion continues (but details are not relevant for this issue)
9. at some future point the background task deletes the vport

If after 7. but before 9. a packet is send to the ovs vport (which is
not deleted at this point in time) which forwards it to the
`dev_queue_xmit` flow even though the device is unregistering.
In `skb_tx_hash` (which is called in the `dev_queue_xmit`) path there is
a while loop (if the packet has a rx_queue recorded) that is infinite if
`dev->real_num_tx_queues` is zero.

To prevent this from happening we update `do_output` to handle devices
without carrier the same as if the device is not found (which would
be the code path after 9. is done).

Additionally we now produce a warning in `skb_tx_hash` if we will hit
the infinite loop.

vxlan: Fix memory leaks in error path

The memory allocated by vxlan_vnigroup_init() is not freed in the error
path, leading to memory leaks [1]. Fix by calling
vxlan_vnigroup_uninit() in the error path.

The leaks can be reproduced by annotating gro_cells_init() with
ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION() and then running:

 # echo ""100"" > /sys/kernel/debug/fail_function/probability
 # echo ""1"" > /sys/kernel/debug/fail_function/times
 # echo ""gro_cells_init"" > /sys/kernel/debug/fail_function/inject
 # printf %#x -12 > /sys/kernel/debug/fail_function/gro_cells_init/retval
 # ip link add name vxlan0 type vxlan dstport 4789 external vnifilter

vxlan: Fix nexthop hash size

The nexthop code expects a 31 bit hash, such as what is returned by
fib_multipath_hash() and rt6_multipath_hash(). Passing the 32 bit hash
returned by skb_get_hash() can lead to problems related to the fact that
'int hash' is a negative number when the MSB is set.

In the case of hash threshold nexthop groups, nexthop_select_path_hthr()
will disproportionately select the first nexthop group entry. In the case
of resilient nexthop groups, nexthop_select_path_res() may do an out of
bounds access in nh_buckets[], for example:
    hash = -912054133
    num_nh_buckets = 2
    bucket_index = 65535

which leads to the following panic:

CVE-2023-53198	2025-09-15T14:15:42.223	2025-09-15T15:22:27.090	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

raw: Fix NULL deref in raw_get_next().

Dae R. Jeong reported a NULL deref in raw_get_next() [0].

It seems that the repro was running these sequences in parallel so
that one thread was iterating on a socket that was being freed in
another netns.

  unshare(0x40060200)
  r0 = syz_open_procfs(0x0, &(0x7f0000002080)='net/raw\x00')
  socket$inet_icmp_raw(0x2, 0x3, 0x1)
  pread64(r0, &(0x7f0000000000)=""""/10, 0xa, 0x10000000007f)

After commit 0daf07e52709 (""raw: convert raw sockets to RCU""), we
use RCU and hlist_nulls_for_each_entry() to iterate over SOCK_RAW
sockets.  However, we should use spinlock for slow paths to avoid
the NULL deref.

Also, SOCK_RAW does not use SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU, and the slab object
is not reused during iteration in the grace period.  In fact, the
lockless readers do not check the nulls marker with get_nulls_value().
So, SOCK_RAW should use hlist instead of hlist_nulls.

Instead of adding an unnecessary barrier by sk_nulls_for_each_rcu(),
let's convert hlist_nulls to hlist and use sk_for_each_rcu() for
fast paths and sk_for_each() and spinlock for /proc/net/raw.

ext4: don't allow journal inode to have encrypt flag

Mounting a filesystem whose journal inode has the encrypt flag causes a
NULL dereference in fscrypt_limit_io_blocks() when the 'inlinecrypt'
mount option is used.

The problem is that when jbd2_journal_init_inode() calls bmap(), it
eventually finds its way into ext4_iomap_begin(), which calls
fscrypt_limit_io_blocks().  fscrypt_limit_io_blocks() requires that if
the inode is encrypted, then its encryption key must already be set up.
That's not the case here, since the journal inode is never ""opened"" like
a normal file would be.  Hence the crash.

A reproducer is:

    mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/vdb
    debugfs -w /dev/vdb -R ""set_inode_field <8> flags 0x80808""
    mount /dev/vdb /mnt -o inlinecrypt

To fix this, make ext4 consider journal inodes with the encrypt flag to
be invalid.  (Note, maybe other flags should be rejected on the journal
inode too.  For now, this is just the minimal fix for the above issue.)

I've marked this as fixing the commit that introduced the call to
fscrypt_limit_io_blocks(), since that's what made an actual crash start
being possible.  But this fix could be applied to any version of ext4
that supports the encrypt feature."

The root cause of the problem is that the comparison order of
""prate_section"" in _rtl8812ae_phy_set_txpower_limit() is wrong. The
_rtl8812ae_eq_n_byte() is used to compare the first n bytes of the two
strings from tail to head, which causes the problem. In the
_rtl8812ae_phy_set_txpower_limit(), it was originally intended to meet
this requirement by carefully designing the comparison order.
For example, ""pregulation"" and ""pbandwidth"" are compared in order of
length from small to large, first is 3 and last is 4. However, the
comparison order of ""prate_section"" dose not obey such order requirement,
therefore when ""prate_section"" is ""HT"", when comparing from tail to head,
it will lead to access out of bounds in _rtl8812ae_eq_n_byte(). As
mentioned above, the _rtl8812ae_eq_n_byte() has the same function as
strcmp(), so just strcmp() is enough.

Fix it by removing _rtl8812ae_eq_n_byte() and use strcmp() barely.
Although it can be fixed by adjusting the comparison order of
""prate_section"", this may cause the value of ""rate_section"" to not be
from 0 to 5. In addition, commit ""21e4b0726dc6"" not only moved driver
from staging to regular tree, but also added setting txpower limit
function during the driver config phase, so the problem was introduced
by this commit."					
CVE-2022-50280	2025-09-15T15:15:39.067	2025-09-15T15:22:27.090	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pnode: terminate at peers of source

The propagate_mnt() function handles mount propagation when creating
mounts and propagates the source mount tree @source_mnt to all
applicable nodes of the destination propagation mount tree headed by
@dest_mnt.

Unfortunately it contains a bug where it fails to terminate at peers of
@source_mnt when looking up copies of the source mount that become
masters for copies of the source mount tree mounted on top of slaves in
the destination propagation tree causing a NULL dereference.

Once the mechanics of the bug are understood it's easy to trigger.
Because of unprivileged user namespaces it is available to unprivileged
users.

While fixing this bug we've gotten confused multiple times due to
unclear terminology or missing concepts. So let's start this with some
clarifications:

* The terms ""master"" or ""peer"" denote a shared mount. A shared mount
  belongs to a peer group.

* A peer group is a set of shared mounts that propagate to each other.
  They are identified by a peer group id. The peer group id is available
  in @shared_mnt->mnt_group_id.
  Shared mounts within the same peer group have the same peer group id.
  The peers in a peer group can be reached via @shared_mnt->mnt_share.

* The terms ""slave mount"" or ""dependent mount"" denote a mount that
  receives propagation from a peer in a peer group. IOW, shared mounts
  may have slave mounts and slave mounts have shared mounts as their
  master. Slave mounts of a given peer in a peer group are listed on
  that peers slave list available at @shared_mnt->mnt_slave_list.

* The term ""master mount"" denotes a mount in a peer group. IOW, it
  denotes a shared mount or a peer mount in a peer group. The term
  ""master mount"" - or ""master"" for short - is mostly used when talking
  in the context of slave mounts that receive propagation from a master
  mount. A master mount of a slave identifies the closest peer group a
  slave mount receives propagation from. The master mount of a slave can
  be identified via @slave_mount->mnt_master. Different slaves may point
  to different masters in the same peer group.

* Multiple peers in a peer group can have non-empty ->mnt_slave_lists.
  Non-empty ->mnt_slave_lists of peers don't intersect. Consequently, to
  ensure all slave mounts of a peer group are visited the
  ->mnt_slave_lists of all peers in a peer group have to be walked.

* Slave mounts point to a peer in the closest peer group they receive
  propagation from via @slave_mnt->mnt_master (see above). Together with
  these peers they form a propagation group (see below). The closest
  peer group can thus be identified through the peer group id
  @slave_mnt->mnt_master->mnt_group_id of the peer/master that a slave
  mount receives propagation from.

* A shared-slave mount is a slave mount to a peer group pg1 while also
  a peer in another peer group pg2. IOW, a peer group may receive
  propagation from another peer group.

  If a peer group pg1 is a slave to another peer group pg2 then all
  peers in peer group pg1 point to the same peer in peer group pg2 via
  ->mnt_master. IOW, all peers in peer group pg1 appear on the same
  ->mnt_slave_list. IOW, they cannot be slaves to different peer groups.

* A pure slave mount is a slave mount that is a slave to a peer group
  but is not a peer in another peer group.

* A propagation group denotes the set of mounts consisting of a single
  peer group pg1 and all slave mounts and shared-slave mounts that point
  to a peer in that peer group via ->mnt_master. IOW, all slave mounts
  such that @slave_mnt->mnt_master->mnt_group_id is equal to
  @shared_mnt->mnt_group_id.

  The concept of a propagation group makes it easier to talk about a
  single propagation level in a propagation tree.

  For example, in propagate_mnt() the immediate peers of @dest_mnt and
  all slaves of @dest_mnt's peer group form a propagation group pr

ext4: fix delayed allocation bug in ext4_clu_mapped for bigalloc + inline

When converting files with inline data to extents, delayed allocations
made on a file system created with both the bigalloc and inline options
can result in invalid extent status cache content, incorrect reserved
cluster counts, kernel memory leaks, and potential kernel panics.

With bigalloc, the code that determines whether a block must be
delayed allocated searches the extent tree to see if that block maps
to a previously allocated cluster.  If not, the block is delayed
allocated, and otherwise, it isn't.  However, if the inline option is
also used, and if the file containing the block is marked as able to
store data inline, there isn't a valid extent tree associated with
the file.  The current code in ext4_clu_mapped() calls
ext4_find_extent() to search the non-existent tree for a previously
allocated cluster anyway, which typically finds nothing, as desired.
However, a side effect of the search can be to cache invalid content
from the non-existent tree (garbage) in the extent status tree,
including bogus entries in the pending reservation tree.

To fix this, avoid searching the extent tree when allocating blocks
for bigalloc + inline files that are being converted from inline to
extent mapped."

drm/msm/dp: fix bridge lifetime

Device-managed resources allocated post component bind must be tied to
the lifetime of the aggregate DRM device or they will not necessarily be
released when binding of the aggregate device is deferred.

This can lead resource leaks or failure to bind the aggregate device
when binding is later retried and a second attempt to allocate the
resources is made.

For the DP bridges, previously allocated bridges will leak on probe
deferral.

Fix this by amending the DP parser interface and tying the lifetime of
the bridge device to the DRM device rather than DP platform device.

btrfs: do not BUG_ON() on ENOMEM when dropping extent items for a range

If we get -ENOMEM while dropping file extent items in a given range, at

increment the reference count for an extent or drop the reference count,
we handle it with a BUG_ON(). This is excessive, instead we can simply
abort the transaction and return the error to the caller. In fact most
callers of btrfs_drop_extents(), directly or indirectly, already abort
the transaction if btrfs_drop_extents() returns any error.

Also, we already have error paths at btrfs_drop_extents() that may return
-ENOMEM and in those cases we abort the transaction, like for example
anything that changes the b+tree may return -ENOMEM due to a failure to
allocate a new extent buffer when COWing an existing extent buffer, such
as a call to btrfs_duplicate_item() for example.

which returns the actual number of characters written into the buffer.

s390/cio: fix out-of-bounds access on cio_ignore free

The channel-subsystem-driver scans for newly available devices whenever
device-IDs are removed from the cio_ignore list using a command such as:

  echo free >/proc/cio_ignore

Since an I/O device scan might interfer with running I/Os, commit
172da89ed0ea (""s390/cio: avoid excessive path-verification requests"")
introduced an optimization to exclude online devices from the scan.

The newly added check for online devices incorrectly assumes that
an I/O-subchannel's drvdata points to a struct io_subchannel_private.
For devices that are bound to a non-default I/O subchannel driver, such
as the vfio_ccw driver, this results in an out-of-bounds read access
during each scan.

Fix this by changing the scan logic to rely on a driver-independent
online indication. For this we can use struct subchannel->config.ena,
which is the driver's requested subchannel-enabled state. Since I/Os
can only be started on enabled subchannels, this matches the intent
of the original optimization of not scanning devices where I/O might
be running."

ip6mr: fix UAF issue in ip6mr_sk_done() when addrconf_init_net() failed

If the initialization fails in calling addrconf_init_net(), devconf_all is
the pointer that has been released. Then ip6mr_sk_done() is called to
release the net, accessing devconf->mc_forwarding directly causes invalid
pointer access.

The process is as follows:
setup_net()
	ops_init()
		addrconf_init_net()
		all = kmemdup(...)           ---> alloc ""all""
		...
		net->ipv6.devconf_all = all;
		__addrconf_sysctl_register() ---> failed
		...
		kfree(all);                  ---> ipv6.devconf_all invalid
		...
	ops_exit_list()
		...
		ip6mr_sk_done()
			devconf = net->ipv6.devconf_all;
			//devconf is invalid pointer
			if (!devconf || !atomic_read(&devconf->mc_forwarding))

This happens because sata_pmp_init_links() initialize link->pmp up to
SATA_PMP_MAX_PORTS while em_priv is declared as 8 elements array.

I can't find the maximum Enclosure Management ports specified in AHCI
spec v1.3.1, but ""12.2.1 LED message type"" states that ""Port Multiplier
Information"" can utilize 4 bits, which implies it can support up to 16
ports. Hence, use SATA_PMP_MAX_PORTS as EM_MAX_SLOTS to resolve the
issue.

rtc: msc313: Fix function prototype mismatch in msc313_rtc_probe()

With clang's kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG),
indirect call targets are validated against the expected function
pointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate
ROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,
which manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed.

msc313_rtc_probe() was passing clk_disable_unprepare() directly, which
did not have matching prototypes for devm_add_action_or_reset()'s
callback argument. Refactor to use devm_clk_get_enabled() instead.

This was found as a result of Clang's new -Wcast-function-type-strict
flag, which is more sensitive than the simpler -Wcast-function-type,

The problem was added by commit 5e0137612430 (""video/aperture: Disable

not exist in the mainline branch.

The mainline commit 5e0137612430 (""video/aperture: Disable and
unregister sysfb devices via aperture helpers"") has been backported
from v6.0-rc1 to stable v6.0.3 from a larger patch series [2] that
reworks fbdev framebuffer ownership. The backport misses a change to
aperture_remove_conflicting_pci_devices(). Mainline itself is fine,
because the function does not exist there as a result of the patch
series.

According to commit ""vfs: parse: deal with zero length string value"",
kernel will set the param->string to null pointer in vfs_parse_fs_string()
if fs string has zero length.

Yet the problem is that, hugetlbfs_parse_param() will dereference the
param->string, without checking whether it is a null pointer.  To be more
specific, if hugetlbfs_parse_param() parses an illegal mount parameter,
such as ""size=,"", kernel will constructs struct fs_parameter with null
pointer in vfs_parse_fs_string(), then passes this struct fs_parameter to
hugetlbfs_parse_param(), which triggers the above null-ptr-deref bug.

This patch solves it by adding sanity check on param->string
in hugetlbfs_parse_param()."

wifi: ath9k: hif_usb: clean up skbs if ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream() fails

Syzkaller detected a memory leak of skbs in ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream().
While processing skbs in ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream(), the already allocated
skbs in skb_pool are not freed if ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream() fails. If we
have an incorrect pkt_len or pkt_tag, the input skb is considered invalid
and dropped. All the associated packets already in skb_pool should be
dropped and freed. Added a comment describing this issue.

The patch also makes remain_skb NULL after being processed so that it
cannot be referenced after potential free. The initialization of hif_dev
fields which are associated with remain_skb (rx_remain_len,
rx_transfer_len and rx_pad_len) is moved after a new remain_skb is
allocated.

netfilter: x_tables: fix percpu counter block leak on error path when creating new netns

Here is the stack where we allocate percpu counter block:

      +-< find_check_entry # {arp,ip,ip6}_tables.c

And it can be leaked on this code path:

  +-> ip6t_register_table
    +-> translate_table # allocates percpu counter block
    +-> xt_register_table # fails

there is no freeing of the counter block on xt_register_table fail.
Note: xt_percpu_counter_free should be called to free it like we do in
do_replace through cleanup_entry helper (or in __ip6t_unregister_table).

Probability of hitting this error path is low AFAICS (xt_register_table
can only return ENOMEM here, as it is not replacing anything, as we are
creating new netns, and it is hard to imagine that all previous
allocations succeeded and after that one in xt_register_table failed).
But it's worth fixing even the rare leak."

KVM: nSVM: Load L1's TSC multiplier based on L1 state, not L2 state

When emulating nested VM-Exit, load L1's TSC multiplier if L1's desired
ratio doesn't match the current ratio, not if the ratio L1 is using for
L2 diverges from the default.  Functionally, the end result is the same
as KVM will run L2 with L1's multiplier if L2's multiplier is the default,
i.e. checking that L1's multiplier is loaded is equivalent to checking if
L2 has a non-default multiplier.

However, the assertion that TSC scaling is exposed to L1 is flawed, as
userspace can trigger the WARN at will by writing the MSR and then
updating guest CPUID to hide the feature (modifying guest CPUID is
allowed anytime before KVM_RUN).  E.g. hacking KVM's state_test

Unlike the nested VMRUN path, hoisting the svm->tsc_scaling_enabled check
into the if-statement is wrong as KVM needs to ensure L1's multiplier is
loaded in the above scenario.   Alternatively, the WARN_ON() could simply
be deleted, but that would make KVM's behavior even more subtle, e.g. it's
not immediately obvious why it's safe to write MSR_AMD64_TSC_RATIO when
checking only tsc_ratio_msr."

Further investigation shows that the warning is superfluous, the migration
disabled task is just going to be migrated to its current running CPU.
This is because that on load balance if the dst_cpu is not allowed by the
task, we'll re-select a new_dst_cpu as a candidate. If no task can be
balanced to dst_cpu we'll try to balance the task to the new_dst_cpu
instead. In this case when the migration disabled task is not on CPU it
only allows to run on its current CPU, load balance will select its
current CPU as new_dst_cpu and later triggers the warning above.

The new_dst_cpu is chosen from the env->dst_grpmask. Currently it
contains CPUs in sched_group_span() and if we have overlapped groups it's
possible to run into this case. This patch makes env->dst_grpmask of
group_balance_mask() which exclude any CPUs from the busiest group and
solve the issue. For balancing in a domain with no overlapped groups
the behaviour keeps same as before."

rxrpc: Make it so that a waiting process can be aborted

When sendmsg() creates an rxrpc call, it queues it to wait for a connection
and channel to be assigned and then waits before it can start shovelling
data as the encrypted DATA packet content includes a summary of the
connection parameters.

However, sendmsg() may get interrupted before a connection gets assigned
and further sendmsg() calls will fail with EBUSY until an assignment is
made.

Fix this so that the call can at least be aborted without failing on
EBUSY.  We have to be careful here as sendmsg() mustn't be allowed to start
the call timer if the call doesn't yet have a connection assigned as an
oops may follow shortly thereafter."

ext4: Fix function prototype mismatch for ext4_feat_ktype

With clang's kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG),
indirect call targets are validated against the expected function
pointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate
ROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,
which manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed.

ext4_feat_ktype was setting the ""release"" handler to ""kfree"", which
doesn't have a matching function prototype. Add a simple wrapper
with the correct prototype.

This was found as a result of Clang's new -Wcast-function-type-strict
flag, which is more sensitive than the simpler -Wcast-function-type,
which only checks for type width mismatches.

erofs: Fix detection of atomic context

Current check for atomic context is not sufficient as
z_erofs_decompressqueue_endio can be called under rcu lock
from blk_mq_flush_plug_list(). See the stacktrace [1]

In such case we should hand off the decompression work for async
processing rather than trying to do sync decompression in current
context. Patch fixes the detection by checking for
rcu_read_lock_any_held() and while at it use more appropriate
!in_task() check than in_atomic().

Background: Historically erofs would always schedule a kworker for
decompression which would incur the scheduling cost regardless of
the context. But z_erofs_decompressqueue_endio() may not always
be in atomic context and we could actually benefit from doing the
decompression in z_erofs_decompressqueue_endio() if we are in
thread context, for example when running with dm-verity.
This optimization was later added in patch [2] which has shown
improvement in performance benchmarks.

mt76: mt7921: fix kernel panic by accessing unallocated eeprom.data

The MT7921 driver no longer uses eeprom.data, but the relevant code has not
been removed completely since
commit 16d98b548365 (""mt76: mt7921: rely on mcu_get_nic_capability"").
This could result in potential invalid memory access.

To fix the kernel panic issue in mt7921, it is necessary to avoid accessing
unallocated eeprom.data which can lead to invalid memory access.

Furthermore, it is possible to entirely eliminate the
mt7921_mcu_parse_eeprom function and solely depend on
mt7921_mcu_parse_response to divide the RxD header.

drm/tests: helpers: Avoid a driver uaf

when using __drm_kunit_helper_alloc_drm_device() the driver may be
dereferenced by device-managed resources up until the device is
freed, which is typically later than the kunit-managed resource code
frees it. Fix this by simply make the driver device-managed as well.

In short, the sequence leading to the UAF is as follows:

INIT:
Code allocates a struct device as a kunit-managed resource.
Code allocates a drm driver as a kunit-managed resource.
Code allocates a drm device as a device-managed resource.

EXIT:
Kunit resource cleanup frees the drm driver
Kunit resource cleanup puts the struct device, which starts a
      device-managed resource cleanup
device-managed cleanup calls drm_dev_put()
drm_dev_put() dereferences the (now freed) drm driver -> Boom.

xsk: check IFF_UP earlier in Tx path

Xsk Tx can be triggered via either sendmsg() or poll() syscalls. These
two paths share a call to common function xsk_xmit() which has two
sanity checks within. A pseudo code example to show the two paths:

__xsk_sendmsg() :                       xsk_poll():

xsk_xmit():

CVE-2023-53243	2025-09-15T15:15:51.457	2025-09-15T15:22:27.090	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: add handling for RAID1C23/DUP to btrfs_reduce_alloc_profile

Callers of `btrfs_reduce_alloc_profile` expect it to return exactly
one allocation profile flag, and failing to do so may ultimately
result in a WARN_ON and remount-ro when allocating new blocks, like
the below transaction abort on 6.1.

`btrfs_reduce_alloc_profile` has two ways of determining the profile,
first it checks if a conversion balance is currently running and
uses the profile we're converting to. If no balance is currently
running, it returns the max-redundancy profile which at least one
block in the selected block group has.

This works by simply checking each known allocation profile bit in
redundancy order. However, `btrfs_reduce_alloc_profile` has not been
updated as new flags have been added - first with the `DUP` profile
and later with the RAID1C34 profiles.

Because of the way it checks, if we have blocks with different
profiles and at least one is known, that profile will be selected.
However, if none are known we may return a flag set with multiple
allocation profiles set.

This is currently only possible when a balance from one of the three
unhandled profiles to another of the unhandled profiles is canceled
after allocating at least one block using the new profile.

In that case, a transaction abort like the below will occur and the
filesystem will need to be mounted with -o skip_balance to get it
mounted rw again (but the balance cannot be resumed without a
similar abort).

When the driver calls tw68_risc_buffer() to prepare the buffer, the

buf->cpu. Later when we free the buffer or access the buffer, null ptr
deref is triggered.

This bug is similar to the following one:

scsi: storvsc: Fix handling of virtual Fibre Channel timeouts

Hyper-V provides the ability to connect Fibre Channel LUNs to the host
system and present them in a guest VM as a SCSI device. I/O to the vFC
device is handled by the storvsc driver. The storvsc driver includes a
partial integration with the FC transport implemented in the generic
portion of the Linux SCSI subsystem so that FC attributes can be displayed
in /sys.  However, the partial integration means that some aspects of vFC
don't work properly. Unfortunately, a full and correct integration isn't
practical because of limitations in what Hyper-V provides to the guest.

In particular, in the context of Hyper-V storvsc, the FC transport timeout
function fc_eh_timed_out() causes a kernel panic because it can't find the
rport and dereferences a NULL pointer. The original patch that added the
call from storvsc_eh_timed_out() to fc_eh_timed_out() is faulty in this
regard.

In many cases a timeout is due to a transient condition, so the situation
can be improved by just continuing to wait like with other I/O requests
issued by storvsc, and avoiding the guaranteed panic. For a permanent
failure, continuing to wait may result in a hung thread instead of a panic,
which again may be better.

So fix the panic by removing the storvsc call to fc_eh_timed_out().  This
allows storvsc to keep waiting for a response.  The change has been tested
by users who experienced a panic in fc_eh_timed_out() due to transient
timeouts, and it solves their problem.

In the future we may want to deprecate the vFC functionality in storvsc
since it can't be fully fixed. But it has current users for whom it is
working well enough, so it should probably stay for a while longer."

This happens because during btrfs_cont_expand we'll get a page, set it
as mapped, and if it's not Uptodate we'll read it.  However between the
read and re-locking the page we could have called release_folio() on the
page, but left the page in the file mapping.  release_folio() can clear
the page private, and thus further down we blow up when we go to modify
the subpage bits.

Fix this by putting the set_page_extent_mapped() after the read.  This
is safe because read_folio() will call set_page_extent_mapped() before
it does the read, and then if we clear page private but leave it on the
mapping we're completely safe re-setting set_page_extent_mapped().  With
this patch I can now run generic/476 without panicing."

---[ end Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception ]---

It is because previous patch added kobject_put() to release the memory
which will call  dmi_sysfs_entry_release() and list_del().

However, list_add_tail(entry->list) is called after the error block,
so the list_head is uninitialized and cannot be deleted.

Move error handling to after list_add_tail to fix this."

CVE-2023-53252	2025-09-15T15:15:52.503	2025-09-15T15:22:27.090	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: use RCU for hci_conn_params and iterate safely in hci_sync

hci_update_accept_list_sync iterates over hdev->pend_le_conns and
hdev->pend_le_reports, and waits for controller events in the loop body,
without holding hdev lock.

Meanwhile, these lists and the items may be modified e.g. by
le_scan_cleanup. This can invalidate the list cursor or any other item
in the list, resulting to invalid behavior (eg use-after-free).

Use RCU for the hci_conn_params action lists. Since the loop bodies in
hci_sync block and we cannot use RCU or hdev->lock for the whole loop,
copy list items first and then iterate on the copy. Only the flags field
is written from elsewhere, so READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE should guarantee we
read valid values.

Free params everywhere with hci_conn_params_free so the cleanup is
guaranteed to be done properly.

This fixes the following, which can be triggered e.g. by BlueZ new
mgmt-tester case ""Add + Remove Device Nowait - Success"", or by changing
hci_le_set_cig_params to always return false, and running iso-tester:

Each physical partition can provide multiple services each with UUID.
Each such service can be presented as logical partition with a unique

will be less than or equal to the number of logical partitions.

However, currently it fails to register more than one logical partition

VM ID while both VM ID and UUID are maintained in the partition information.

By virtue of being random enough to avoid collisions when generated in a
distributed system, there is no way to compress UUID keys to the number
of bits required to identify each. We can eliminate '-' in the name but
it is not worth eliminating 4 bytes and add unnecessary logic for doing
that. Also v1.0 doesn't provide the UUID of the partitions which makes
it hard to use the same for the device name.

So to keep it simple, let us alloc an ID using ida_alloc() and append the
same to ""arm-ffa"" to make up a unique device name. Also stash the id value
in ffa_dev to help freeing the ID later when the device is destroyed."

From 1.4.0 to before 1.5.0, hackmd-mcp contains a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability when the server is run in HTTP transport mode. Arbitrary hackmdApiUrl values supplied via the Hackmd-Api-Url HTTP header or a base64-encoded JSON query parameter are accepted without validation, allowing attackers to redirect outbound API requests to internal network services, access internal endpoints, perform network reconnaissance, and bypass network access controls. The stdio transport mode is not affected because it only accepts stdio requests. The issue is fixed in version 1.5.0, which enforces allowed endpoints and supports the ALLOWED_HACKMD_API_URLS environment variable. Users should update to 1.5.0 or later or apply documented mitigations such as switching to stdio mode, restricting outbound network access, or filtering the Hackmd-Api-Url header and related query parameter via a reverse proxy.

CVE-2025-59154	2025-09-15T20:15:39.237	2025-09-16T12:49:16.060	"Openfire is an XMPP server licensed under the Open Source Apache License. Openfire’s SASL EXTERNAL mechanism for client TLS authentication contains a vulnerability in how it extracts user identities from X.509 certificates. Instead of parsing the structured ASN.1 data, the code calls X509Certificate.getSubjectDN().getName() and applies a regex to look for CN=. This method produces a provider-dependent string that does not escape special characters. In SunJSSE (sun.security.x509.X500Name), for example, commas and equals signs inside attribute values are not escaped. As a result, a malicious certificate can embed CN= inside another attribute value (e.g. OU=""CN=admin,""). The regex will incorrectly interpret this as a legitimate Common Name and extract admin. If SASL EXTERNAL is enabled and configured to map CNs to user accounts, this allows the attacker to impersonate another user. The fix is included in Openfire 5.0.2 and 5.1.0."	5.9	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

This reverts commit 860690a93ef23b567f781c1b631623e27190f101.

On the MT8183, the SSPM related clocks were removed claiming a lack of
usage. This however causes some issues when the driver was converted to
the new simple-probe mechanism. This mechanism allocates enough space
for all the clocks defined in the clock driver, not the highest index
in the DT binding. This leads to out-of-bound writes if their are holes
in the DT binding or the driver (due to deprecated or unimplemented
clocks). These errors can go unnoticed and cause memory corruption,
leading to crashes in unrelated areas, or nothing at all. KASAN will
detect them.

Add the SSPM related clocks back to the MT8183 clock driver to fully
implement the DT binding. The SSPM clocks are for the power management
co-processor, and should never be turned off. They are marked as such."

ALSA: hda: fix a possible null-pointer dereference due to data race in snd_hdac_regmap_sync()

The variable codec->regmap is often protected by the lock

holding the lock when is accessed in snd_hdac_regmap_sync():

  if (codec->regmap)

In my opinion, this may be a harmful race, because if codec->regmap is
set to NULL right after the condition is checked, a null-pointer
dereference can occur in the called function regcache_sync():

  map->lock(map->lock_arg); --> Line 360 in drivers/base/regmap/regcache.c

To fix this possible null-pointer dereference caused by data race, the
mutex_lock coverage is extended to protect the if statement as well as the
function call to regcache_sync().

[ Note: the lack of the regmap_lock itself is harmless for the current
  codec driver implementations, as snd_hdac_regmap_sync() is only for
  PM runtime resume that is prohibited during the codec probe.

sctp: check send stream number after wait_for_sndbuf

This patch fixes a corner case where the asoc out stream count may change
after wait_for_sndbuf.

When the main thread in the client starts a connection, if its out stream
count is set to N while the in stream count in the server is set to N - 2,
another thread in the client keeps sending the msgs with stream number
N - 1, and waits for sndbuf before processing INIT_ACK.

However, after processing INIT_ACK, the out stream count in the client is
shrunk to N - 2, the same to the in stream count in the server. The crash
occurs when the thread waiting for sndbuf is awake and sends the msg in a
non-existing stream(N - 1), the call trace is as below:

HID: multitouch: fix slab out-of-bounds access in mt_report_fixup()

A malicious HID device can trigger a slab out-of-bounds during
mt_report_fixup() by passing in report descriptor smaller than
607 bytes. mt_report_fixup() attempts to patch byte offset 607
of the descriptor with 0x25 by first checking if byte offset
607 is 0x15 however it lacks bounds checks to verify if the
descriptor is big enough before conducting this check. Fix
this bug by ensuring the descriptor size is at least 608
bytes before accessing it.

bnxt_en: Fix memory corruption when FW resources change during ifdown

bnxt_set_dflt_rings() assumes that it is always called before any TC has

that it is always 0 or 1.

In the FW resource or capability change scenario, the FW will return
flags in bnxt_hwrm_if_change() that will cause the driver to
reinitialize and call bnxt_cancel_reservations().  This will lead to
bnxt_init_dflt_ring_mode() calling bnxt_set_dflt_rings() and bp->num_tc
may be greater than 1.  This will cause bp->tx_ring[] to be sized too
small and cause memory corruption in bnxt_alloc_cp_rings().

ftrace: Fix potential warning in trace_printk_seq during ftrace_dump

When calling ftrace_dump_one() concurrently with reading trace_pipe,
a WARN_ON_ONCE() in trace_printk_seq() can be triggered due to a race
condition.

The issue occurs because:

CPU0 (ftrace_dump)                              CPU1 (reader)
echo z > /proc/sysrq-trigger

!trace_empty(&iter)

  __find_next_entry
    ring_buffer_empty_cpu <- all empty
  return NULL

trace_printk_seq(&iter.seq)
  WARN_ON_ONCE(s->seq.len >= s->seq.size)

In the context between trace_empty() and trace_find_next_entry_inc()
during ftrace_dump, the ring buffer data was consumed by other readers.
This caused trace_find_next_entry_inc to return NULL, failing to populate
`iter.seq`. At this point, due to the prior trace_iterator_reset, both
`iter.seq.len` and `iter.seq.size` were set to 0. Since they are equal,
the WARN_ON_ONCE condition is triggered.

Move the trace_printk_seq() into the if block that checks to make sure the
return value of trace_find_next_entry_inc() is non-NULL in
ftrace_dump_one(), ensuring the 'iter.seq' is properly populated before
subsequent operations."

fs/smb: Fix inconsistent refcnt update

A possible inconsistent update of refcount was identified in `smb2_compound_op`.
Such inconsistent update could lead to possible resource leaks.

Why it is a possible bug:
1. In the comment section of the function, it clearly states that the
reference to `cfile` should be dropped after calling this function.
2. Every control flow path would check and drop the reference to
`cfile`, except the patched one.
3. Existing callers would not handle refcount update of `cfile` if
-ENOMEM is returned.

To fix the bug, an extra goto label ""out"" is added, to make sure that the
cleanup logic would always be respected. As the problem is caused by the
allocation failure of `vars`, the cleanup logic between label ""finished""
and ""out"" can be safely ignored. According to the definition of function
`is_replayable_error`, the error code of ""-ENOMEM"" is not recoverable.
Therefore, the replay logic also gets ignored."

perf: Avoid undefined behavior from stopping/starting inactive events

Calling pmu->start()/stop() on perf events in PERF_EVENT_STATE_OFF can
leave event->hw.idx at -1. When PMU drivers later attempt to use this
negative index as a shift exponent in bitwise operations, it leads to UBSAN
shift-out-of-bounds reports.

The issue is a logical flaw in how event groups handle throttling when some
members are intentionally disabled. Based on the analysis and the
reproducer provided by Mark Rutland (this issue on both arm64 and x86-64).

The scenario unfolds as follows:

 1. A group leader event is configured with a very aggressive sampling
    period (e.g., sample_period = 1). This causes frequent interrupts and
    triggers the throttling mechanism.
 2. A child event in the same group is created in a disabled state
    (.disabled = 1). This event remains in PERF_EVENT_STATE_OFF.
    Since it hasn't been scheduled onto the PMU, its event->hw.idx remains
    initialized at -1.
 3. When throttling occurs, perf_event_throttle_group() and later
    perf_event_unthrottle_group() iterate through all siblings, including
    the disabled child event.
 4. perf_event_throttle()/unthrottle() are called on this inactive child
    event, which then call event->pmu->start()/stop().
 5. The PMU driver receives the event with hw.idx == -1 and attempts to
    use it as a shift exponent. e.g., in macros like PMCNTENSET(idx),
    leading to the UBSAN report.

The throttling mechanism attempts to start/stop events that are not
actively scheduled on the hardware.

Move the state check into perf_event_throttle()/perf_event_unthrottle() so
that inactive events are skipped entirely. This ensures only active events
with a valid hw.idx are processed, preventing undefined behavior and
silencing UBSAN warnings. The corrected check ensures true before
proceeding with PMU operations.

The problem can be reproduced with the syzkaller reproducer:"

HID: asus: fix UAF via HID_CLAIMED_INPUT validation

After hid_hw_start() is called hidinput_connect() will eventually be
called to set up the device with the input layer since the
HID_CONNECT_DEFAULT connect mask is used. During hidinput_connect()
all input and output reports are processed and corresponding hid_inputs
are allocated and configured via hidinput_configure_usages(). This
process involves slot tagging report fields and configuring usages
by setting relevant bits in the capability bitmaps. However it is possible
that the capability bitmaps are not set at all leading to the subsequent
hidinput_has_been_populated() check to fail leading to the freeing of the
hid_input and the underlying input device.

This becomes problematic because a malicious HID device like a
ASUS ROG N-Key keyboard can trigger the above scenario via a
specially crafted descriptor which then leads to a user-after-free
when the name of the freed input device is written to later on after
hid_hw_start(). Below, report 93 intentionally utilises the

CVE-2025-39825	2025-09-16T13:16:01.780	2025-09-17T14:18:55.093	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: fix race with concurrent opens in rename(2)

Besides sending the rename request to the server, the rename process
also involves closing any deferred close, waiting for outstanding I/O
to complete as well as marking all existing open handles as deleted to
prevent them from deferring closes, which increases the race window
for potential concurrent opens on the target file.

Fix this by unhashing the dentry in advance to prevent any concurrent
opens on the target."					
CVE-2025-39826	2025-09-16T13:16:02.290	2025-09-17T14:18:55.093	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: rose: convert 'use' field to refcount_t

The 'use' field in struct rose_neigh is used as a reference counter but
lacks atomicity. This can lead to race conditions where a rose_neigh
structure is freed while still being referenced by other code paths.

For example, when rose_neigh->use becomes zero during an ioctl operation
via rose_rt_ioctl(), the structure may be removed while its timer is
still active, potentially causing use-after-free issues.

This patch changes the type of 'use' from unsigned short to refcount_t and
updates all code paths to use rose_neigh_hold() and rose_neigh_put() which
operate reference counts atomically."					
CVE-2025-39827	2025-09-16T13:16:02.873	2025-09-17T14:18:55.093	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: rose: include node references in rose_neigh refcount

Current implementation maintains two separate reference counting
mechanisms: the 'count' field in struct rose_neigh tracks references from
rose_node structures, while the 'use' field (now refcount_t) tracks
references from rose_sock.

This patch merges these two reference counting systems using 'use' field
for proper reference management. Specifically, this patch adds incrementing
and decrementing of rose_neigh->use when rose_neigh->count is incremented
or decremented.

This patch also modifies rose_rt_free(), rose_rt_device_down() and
rose_clear_route() to properly release references to rose_neigh objects
before freeing a rose_node through rose_remove_node().

These changes ensure rose_neigh structures are properly freed only when
all references, including those from rose_node structures, are released.
As a result, this resolves a slab-use-after-free issue reported by Syzbot."					
CVE-2025-39828	2025-09-16T13:16:03.373	2025-09-17T14:18:55.093	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

atm: atmtcp: Prevent arbitrary write in atmtcp_recv_control().

syzbot reported the splat below. [0]

When atmtcp_v_open() or atmtcp_v_close() is called via connect()
or close(), atmtcp_send_control() is called to send an in-kernel
special message.

The message has ATMTCP_HDR_MAGIC in atmtcp_control.hdr.length.
Also, a pointer of struct atm_vcc is set to atmtcp_control.vcc.

The notable thing is struct atmtcp_control is uAPI but has a
space for an in-kernel pointer.

  struct atmtcp_control {
  	struct atmtcp_hdr hdr;	/* must be first */
  ...
  	atm_kptr_t vcc;		/* both directions */
  ...
  } __ATM_API_ALIGN;

  typedef struct { unsigned char _[8]; } __ATM_API_ALIGN atm_kptr_t;

The special message is processed in atmtcp_recv_control() called
from atmtcp_c_send().

atmtcp_c_send() is vcc->dev->ops->send() and called from 2 paths:

  1. .ndo_start_xmit() (vcc->send() == atm_send_aal0())
  2. vcc_sendmsg()

The problem is sendmsg() does not validate the message length and
userspace can abuse atmtcp_recv_control() to overwrite any kptr
by atmtcp_control.

Let's add a new ->pre_send() hook to validate messages from sendmsg().

A bit of digging showed that we were invoking the phylink_resume as a part
of the fbnic_up path when we were enabling the service task while not
holding the RTNL lock. We should be enabling this sooner as a part of the
ndo_open path and then just letting the service task come online later.
This will help to enforce the correct locking and brings the phylink
interface online at the same time as the network interface, instead of at a
later time.

I tested this on QEMU to verify this was working by putting the system to
sleep using ""echo mem > /sys/power/state"" to put the system to sleep in the
guest and then using the command ""system_wakeup"" in the QEMU monitor."

event. In this case, delegate sync reset unload event handling back to
the devlink callback process to avoid double-locking and resolve the

xfs: do not propagate ENODATA disk errors into xattr code

ENODATA (aka ENOATTR) has a very specific meaning in the xfs xattr code;
namely, that the requested attribute name could not be found.

However, a medium error from disk may also return ENODATA. At best,
this medium error may escape to userspace as ""attribute not found""
when in fact it's an IO (disk) error.

At worst, we may oops in xfs_attr_leaf_get() when we do:

	error = xfs_attr_leaf_hasname(args, &bp);
	if (error == -ENOATTR)  {
		xfs_trans_brelse(args->trans, bp);
		return error;
	}

because an ENODATA/ENOATTR error from disk leaves us with a null bp,
and the xfs_trans_brelse will then null-deref it.

As discussed on the list, we really need to modify the lower level
IO functions to trap all disk errors and ensure that we don't let
unique errors like this leak up into higher xfs functions - many
like this should be remapped to EIO.

However, this patch directly addresses a reported bug in the xattr
code, and should be safe to backport to stable kernels. A larger-scope
patch to handle more unique errors at lower levels can follow later.

(Note, prior to 07120f1abdff we did not oops, but we did return the
wrong error code to userspace.)"

In WAMR versions prior to 2.4.2, when running in LLVM-JIT mode, the runtime cannot exit normally when executing WebAssembly programs containing a memory.fill instruction where the first operand (memory address pointer) is greater than or equal to 2147483648 bytes (2GiB). This causes the runtime to hang in release builds or crash in debug builds due to accessing an invalid pointer. The issue does not occur in FAST-JIT mode or other runtime tools.

Bluetooth: avoid hci_dev_test_and_set_flag() in mgmt_init_hdev()

syzbot is again reporting attempt to cancel uninitialized work
at mgmt_index_removed() [1], for setting of HCI_MGMT flag from
mgmt_init_hdev() from hci_mgmt_cmd() from hci_sock_sendmsg() can
race with testing of HCI_MGMT flag from mgmt_index_removed() from
hci_sock_bind() due to lack of serialization via hci_dev_lock().

Since mgmt_init_hdev() is called with mgmt_chan_list_lock held, we can
safely split hci_dev_test_and_set_flag() into hci_dev_test_flag() and
hci_dev_set_flag(). Thus, in order to close this race, set HCI_MGMT flag
after INIT_DELAYED_WORK() completed.

This is a local fix based on mgmt_chan_list_lock. Lack of serialization
via hci_dev_lock() might be causing different race conditions somewhere
else. But a global fix based on hci_dev_lock() should deserve a future
patch."

This is because in scatterwalk_copychunks(), we attempted to write to
a buffer (@sign) that was allocated in the stack (vmalloc area) by
crypt_message() and thus accessing its remaining 8 (x2) bytes ended up
crossing a page boundary.

To simply fix it, we could just pass @sign kmalloc'd from
crypt_message() and then we're done.  Luckily, we don't seem to pass
any other vmalloc'd buffers in smb_rqst::rq_iov...

Instead, let's map the correct pages and offsets from vmalloc buffers
as well in cifs_sg_set_buf() and then avoiding such oopses."

thus the lastest allocated set->tag cannot be freed in the error handling
path. A simple call graph shown as below:

nilfs2: fix use-after-free of nilfs_root in dirtying inodes via iput

During unmount process of nilfs2, nothing holds nilfs_root structure after
nilfs2 detaches its writer in nilfs_detach_log_writer().  Previously,
nilfs_evict_inode() could cause use-after-free read for nilfs_root if
inodes are left in ""garbage_list"" and released by nilfs_dispose_list at
the end of nilfs_detach_log_writer(), and this bug was fixed by commit
9b5a04ac3ad9 (""nilfs2: fix use-after-free bug of nilfs_root in
nilfs_evict_inode()"").

However, it turned out that there is another possibility of UAF in the
call path where mark_inode_dirty_sync() is called from iput():

nilfs_detach_log_writer()
  nilfs_dispose_list()
    iput()
      mark_inode_dirty_sync()
        __mark_inode_dirty()
          nilfs_dirty_inode()
            __nilfs_mark_inode_dirty()
              nilfs_load_inode_block() --> causes UAF of nilfs_root struct

This can happen after commit 0ae45f63d4ef (""vfs: add support for a
lazytime mount option""), which changed iput() to call
mark_inode_dirty_sync() on its final reference if i_state has I_DIRTY_TIME
flag and i_nlink is non-zero.

This issue appears after commit 28a65b49eb53 (""nilfs2: do not write dirty
data after degenerating to read-only"") when using the syzbot reproducer,
but the issue has potentially existed before.

Fix this issue by adding a ""purging flag"" to the nilfs structure, setting
that flag while disposing the ""garbage_list"" and checking it in
__nilfs_mark_inode_dirty().

Unlike commit 9b5a04ac3ad9 (""nilfs2: fix use-after-free bug of nilfs_root
in nilfs_evict_inode()""), this patch does not rely on ns_writer to
determine whether to skip operations, so as not to break recovery on
mount.  The nilfs_salvage_orphan_logs routine dirties the buffer of
salvaged data before attaching the log writer, so changing
__nilfs_mark_inode_dirty() to skip the operation when ns_writer is NULL
will cause recovery write to fail.  The purpose of using the cleanup-only
flag is to allow for narrowing of such conditions."

wifi: ath11k: Fix SKB corruption in REO destination ring

While running traffics for a long time, randomly an RX descriptor
filled with value ""0"" from REO destination ring is received.
This descriptor which is invalid causes the wrong SKB (SKB stored in
the IDR lookup with buffer id ""0"") to be fetched which in turn
causes SKB memory corruption issue and the same leads to crash
after some time.

Changed the start id for idr allocation to ""1"" and the buffer id ""0""
is reserved for error validation. Introduced Sanity check to validate
the descriptor, before processing the SKB.

The function mpi3mr_get_all_tgt_info() has four issues:

1) It calculates valid entry length in alltgt_info assuming the header part
   of the struct mpi3mr_device_map_info would equal to sizeof(u32).  The
   correct size is sizeof(u64).

2) When it calculates the valid entry length kern_entrylen, it excludes one
   entry by subtracting 1 from num_devices.

3) It copies num_device by calling memcpy(). Substitution is enough.

4) It does not specify the calculated length to sg_copy_from_buffer().
   Instead, it specifies the payload length which is larger than the
   alltgt_info size. It causes ""BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds"".

from num_devices, replacing the memcpy() with substitution and specifying

ext2/dax: Fix ext2_setsize when len is page aligned

PAGE_ALIGN(x) macro gives the next highest value which is multiple of

So, if x passed is 0 in dax_zero_range() function, that means the
length gets passed as 0 to ->iomap_begin().

In ext2 it then calls ext2_get_blocks -> max_blocks as 0 and hits bug_on
here in ext2_get_blocks().

Instead we should be calling dax_truncate_page() here which takes
care of it. i.e. it only calls dax_zero_range if the offset is not
page/block aligned.

drm/msm/mdp5: Don't leak some plane state

Apparently no one noticed that mdp5 plane states leak like a sieve
ever since we introduced plane_state->commit refcount a few years ago
in 21a01abbe32a (""drm/atomic: Fix freeing connector/plane state too
early by tracking commits, v3."")

Fix it by using the right helpers.

drm/mediatek: dp: Change logging to dev for mtk_dp_aux_transfer()

Change logging from drm_{err,info}() to dev_{err,info}() in functions
mtk_dp_aux_transfer() and mtk_dp_aux_do_transfer(): this will be
essential to avoid getting NULL pointer kernel panics if any kind
of error happens during AUX transfers happening before the bridge
is attached.

This may potentially start happening in a later commit implementing
aux-bus support, as AUX transfers will be triggered from the panel
driver (for EDID) before the mtk-dp bridge gets attached, and it's
done in preparation for the same."

powerpc: Don't try to copy PPR for task with NULL pt_regs

powerpc sets up PF_KTHREAD and PF_IO_WORKER with a NULL pt_regs, which
from my (arguably very short) checking is not commonly done for other
archs. This is fine, except when PF_IO_WORKER's have been created and
the task does something that causes a coredump to be generated. Then we
get this crash:

pstore/ram: Check start of empty przs during init

After commit 30696378f68a (""pstore/ram: Do not treat empty buffers as
valid""), initialization would assume a prz was valid after seeing that
the buffer_size is zero (regardless of the buffer start position). This
unchecked start value means it could be outside the bounds of the buffer,
leading to future access panics when written to:

 sysdump_panic_event+0x3b4/0x5b8

To avoid this, also check if the prz start is 0 during the initialization

size) and zap the buffer back to a sane state.

Eric Dumazet says:

  And nothing more is 'pulled' from the packet, depending on the content.

Fix this by increasing the stack buffer to also include room for
the extra sequence numbers and all the known dccp packet type headers,
then pull again after the initial validation of the basic header.

While at it, mark packets invalid that lack 48bit sequence bit but
where RFC says the type MUST use them.

Compile tested only.

CVE-2025-59050	2025-09-16T17:15:41.433	2025-10-02T18:54:39.903	Greenshot is an open source Windows screenshot utility. Greenshot 1.3.300 and earlier deserializes attacker-controlled data received in a WM_COPYDATA message using BinaryFormatter.Deserialize without prior validation or authentication, allowing a local process at the same integrity level to trigger arbitrary code execution inside the Greenshot process. The vulnerable logic resides in a WinForms WndProc handler for WM_COPYDATA (message 74) that copies the supplied bytes into a MemoryStream and invokes BinaryFormatter.Deserialize, and only afterward checks whether the specified channel is authorized. Because the authorization check occurs after deserialization, any gadget chain embedded in the serialized payload executes regardless of channel membership. A local attacker who can send WM_COPYDATA to the Greenshot main window can achieve in-process code execution, which may aid evasion of application control policies by running payloads within the trusted, signed Greenshot.exe process. This issue is fixed in version 1.3.301. No known workarounds exist.	8.4	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2025-59334	2025-09-16T17:15:41.893	2025-10-08T19:16:13.530	Linkr is a lightweight file delivery system that downloads files from a webserver. Linkr versions through 2.0.0 do not verify the integrity or authenticity of .linkr manifest files before using their contents, allowing a tampered manifest to inject arbitrary file entries into a package distribution. An attacker can modify a generated .linkr manifest (for example by adding a new entry with a malicious URL) and when a user runs the extract command the client downloads the attacker-supplied file without verification. This enables arbitrary file injection and creates a potential path to remote code execution if a downloaded malicious binary or script is later executed. Version 2.0.1 adds a manifest integrity check that compares the checksum of the original author-created manifest to the one being extracted and aborts on mismatch, warning if no original manifest is hosted. Users should update to 2.0.1 or later. As a workaround prior to updating, use only trusted .linkr manifests, manually verify manifest integrity, and host manifests on trusted servers.	9.6	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

This can lead resource leaks or failure to bind the aggregate device

For the DP aux-bus, an attempt to populate the bus a second time will

This occurs because the transmission timed out, and that's due
to data race. Each thread rewrite channels's descriptor as soon as
device_issue_pending is called. It leads to the situation that
the driver thinks that it uses the right descriptor in interrupt
handler while channels's descriptor has been changed by other
thread. The descriptor which in fact reported interrupt will not
be handled any more, as well as its tx->callback.
That's why timeout reports.

With current fixes channels' descriptor changes it's value only
when it has been used. A new descriptor is acquired from
vc->desc_issued queue that is already filled with descriptors
that are ready to be sent. Threads have no direct access to DMA
channel descriptor. In case of channel's descriptor is busy, try
to submit to HW again when a descriptor is completed. In this case,
vc->desc_issued may be empty when hisi_dma_start_transfer is called,
so delete error reporting on this. Now it is just possible to queue
a descriptor for further processing."

i2c: designware: Fix handling of real but unexpected device interrupts

Commit c7b79a752871 (""mfd: intel-lpss: Add Intel Alder Lake PCH-S PCI
IDs"") caused a regression on certain Gigabyte motherboards for Intel
Alder Lake-S where system crashes to NULL pointer dereference in
i2c_dw_xfer_msg() when system resumes from S3 sleep state (""deep"").

I was able to debug the issue on Gigabyte Z690 AORUS ELITE and made
following notes:

- Issue happens when resuming from S3 but not when resuming from
  ""s2idle""
- PCI device 00:15.0 == i2c_designware.0 is already in D0 state when
  system enters into pci_pm_resume_noirq() while all other i2c_designware
  PCI devices are in D3. Devices were runtime suspended and in D3 prior
  entering into suspend
- Interrupt comes after pci_pm_resume_noirq() when device interrupts are
  re-enabled
- According to register dump the interrupt really comes from the
  i2c_designware.0. Controller is enabled, I2C target address register
  points to a one detectable I2C device address 0x60 and the
  DW_IC_RAW_INTR_STAT register START_DET, STOP_DET, ACTIVITY and
  TX_EMPTY bits are set indicating completed I2C transaction.

My guess is that the firmware uses this controller to communicate with
an on-board I2C device during resume but does not disable the controller
before giving control to an operating system.

I was told the UEFI update fixes this but never the less it revealed the
driver is not ready to handle TX_EMPTY (or RX_FULL) interrupt when device
is supposed to be idle and state variables are not set (especially the
dev->msgs pointer which may point to NULL or stale old data).

Introduce a new software status flag STATUS_ACTIVE indicating when the
controller is active in driver point of view. Now treat all interrupts
that occur when is not set as unexpected and mask all interrupts from
the controller."

I reproduced this warning with dlm_locktorture test which is currently
not upstream. However this patch fix the issue by make a additional
refcount between dlm_lowcomms_new_msg() and dlm_lowcomms_commit_msg().
In case of the race the kref_put() in dlm_lowcomms_commit_msg() will be
the final put."

nilfs2: do not write dirty data after degenerating to read-only

According to syzbot's report, mark_buffer_dirty() called from
nilfs_segctor_do_construct() outputs a warning with some patterns after
nilfs2 detects metadata corruption and degrades to read-only mode.

After such read-only degeneration, page cache data may be cleared through
nilfs_clear_dirty_page() which may also clear the uptodate flag for their
buffer heads.  However, even after the degeneration, log writes are still
performed by unmount processing etc., which causes mark_buffer_dirty() to
be called for buffer heads without the ""uptodate"" flag and causes the
warning.

Since any writes should not be done to a read-only file system in the
first place, this fixes the warning in mark_buffer_dirty() by letting
nilfs_segctor_do_construct() abort early if in read-only mode.

This also changes the retry check of nilfs_segctor_write_out() to avoid
unnecessary log write retries if it detects -EROFS that
nilfs_segctor_do_construct() returned."

lwt: Fix return values of BPF xmit ops

BPF encap ops can return different types of positive values, such like
NET_RX_DROP, NET_XMIT_CN, NETDEV_TX_BUSY, and so on, from function
skb_do_redirect and bpf_lwt_xmit_reroute. At the xmit hook, such return
values would be treated implicitly as LWTUNNEL_XMIT_CONTINUE in
ip(6)_finish_output2. When this happens, skbs that have been freed would
continue to the neighbor subsystem, causing use-after-free bug and
kernel crashes.

To fix the incorrect behavior, skb_do_redirect return values can be
simply discarded, the same as tc-egress behavior. On the other hand,
bpf_lwt_xmit_reroute returns useful errors to local senders, e.g. PMTU
information. Thus convert its return values to avoid the conflict with
LWTUNNEL_XMIT_CONTINUE."

CVE-2023-53343	2025-09-17T15:15:38.100	2025-09-18T13:43:34.310	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

icmp6: Fix null-ptr-deref of ip6_null_entry->rt6i_idev in icmp6_dev().

With some IPv6 Ext Hdr (RPL, SRv6, etc.), we can send a packet that
has the link-local address as src and dst IP and will be forwarded to
an external IP in the IPv6 Ext Hdr.

For example, the script below generates a packet whose src IP is the
link-local address and dst is updated to 11::.

  # for f in $(find /proc/sys/net/ -name *seg6_enabled*); do echo 1 > $f; done
  # python3
  >>> from socket import *
  >>> from scapy.all import *
  >>>
  >>> SRC_ADDR = DST_ADDR = ""fe80::5054:ff:fe12:3456""
  >>>
  >>> pkt = IPv6(src=SRC_ADDR, dst=DST_ADDR)
  >>> pkt /= IPv6ExtHdrSegmentRouting(type=4, addresses=[""11::"", ""22::""], segleft=1)
  >>>
  >>> sk = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_RAW)
  >>> sk.sendto(bytes(pkt), (DST_ADDR, 0))

For such a packet, we call ip6_route_input() to look up a route for the
next destination in these three functions depending on the header type.

  * ipv6_rthdr_rcv()
  * ipv6_rpl_srh_rcv()
  * ipv6_srh_rcv()

If no route is found, ip6_null_entry is set to skb, and the following
dst_input(skb) calls ip6_pkt_drop().

Finally, in icmp6_dev(), we dereference skb_rt6_info(skb)->rt6i_idev->dev
as the input device is the loopback interface.  Then, we have to check if
skb_rt6_info(skb)->rt6i_idev is NULL or not to avoid NULL pointer deref
for ip6_null_entry.

=====================================================

We can follow the call chain and find that 'bcm_tx_setup' function
calls 'memcpy_from_msg' to copy some content to the newly allocated
frame of 'op->frames'. After that the 'len' field of copied structure
being compared with some constant value (64 or 8). However, if
'memcpy_from_msg' returns an error, we will compare some uninitialized
memory. This triggers 'uninit-value' issue.

This patch will add 'memcpy_from_msg' possible errors processing to
avoid uninit-value issue.

CVE-2023-53345	2025-09-17T15:15:38.363	2025-09-18T13:43:34.310	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rxrpc: Fix potential data race in rxrpc_wait_to_be_connected()

Inside the loop in rxrpc_wait_to_be_connected() it checks call->error to
see if it should exit the loop without first checking the call state.  This
is probably safe as if call->error is set, the call is dead anyway, but we
should probably wait for the call state to have been set to completion
first, lest it cause surprise on the way out.

Fix this by only accessing call->error if the call is complete.  We don't
actually need to access the error inside the loop as we'll do that after.

This caused the following report:

net/mlx5: Handle pairing of E-switch via uplink un/load APIs

In case user switch a device from switchdev mode to legacy mode, mlx5
first unpair the E-switch and afterwards unload the uplink vport.
From the other hand, in case user remove or reload a device, mlx5
first unload the uplink vport and afterwards unpair the E-switch.

The latter is causing a bug[1], hence, handle pairing of E-switch as
part of uplink un/load APIs.

[1]
In case VF_LAG is used, every tc fdb flow is duplicated to the peer
esw. However, the original esw keeps a pointer to this duplicated
flow, not the peer esw.
e.g.: if user create tc fdb flow over esw0, the flow is duplicated
over esw1, in FW/HW, but in SW, esw0 keeps a pointer to the duplicated
flow.
During module unload while a peer tc fdb flow is still offloaded, in
case the first device to be removed is the peer device (esw1 in the
example above), the peer net-dev is destroyed, and so the mlx5e_priv
is memset to 0.
Afterwards, the peer device is trying to unpair himself from the
original device (esw0 in the example above). Unpair API invoke the
original device to clear peer flow from its eswitch (esw0), but the
peer flow, which is stored over the original eswitch (esw0), is
trying to use the peer mlx5e_priv, which is memset to 0 and result in
bellow kernel-oops.

drm/sched: Check scheduler work queue before calling timeout handling

During an IGT GPU reset test we see again oops despite of
commit 0c8c901aaaebc9 (drm/sched: Check scheduler ready before calling
timeout handling).

It uses ready condition whether to call drm_sched_fault which unwind
the TDR leads to GPU reset.
However it looks the ready condition is overloaded with other meanings,
for example, for the following stack is related GPU reset :

0  gfx_v9_0_cp_gfx_start
1  gfx_v9_0_cp_gfx_resume
2  gfx_v9_0_cp_resume
3  gfx_v9_0_hw_init
4  gfx_v9_0_resume
5  amdgpu_device_ip_resume_phase2

does the following:
	/* start the ring */
	gfx_v9_0_cp_gfx_start(adev);
	ring->sched.ready = true;

The same approach is for other ASICs as well :
gfx_v8_0_cp_gfx_resume
gfx_v10_0_kiq_resume, etc...

As a result, our GPU reset test causes GPU fault which calls unconditionally gfx_v9_0_fault
and then drm_sched_fault. However now it depends on whether the interrupt service routine
drm_sched_fault is executed after gfx_v9_0_cp_gfx_start is completed which sets the ready
field of the scheduler to true even  for uninitialized schedulers and causes oops vs
no fault or when ISR  drm_sched_fault is completed prior  gfx_v9_0_cp_gfx_start and
NULL pointer dereference does not occur.

Use the field timeout_wq  to prevent oops for uninitialized schedulers.
The field could be initialized by the work queue of resetting the domain.

accel/habanalabs: postpone mem_mgr IDR destruction to hpriv_release()

The memory manager IDR is currently destroyed when user releases the
file descriptor.
However, at this point the user context might be still held, and memory
buffers might be still in use.
Later on, calls to release those buffers will fail due to not finding
their handles in the IDR, leading to a memory leak.
To avoid this leak, split the IDR destruction from the memory manager
fini, and postpone it to hpriv_release() when there is no user context
and no buffers are used."

skbuff: skb_segment, Call zero copy functions before using skbuff frags

Commit bf5c25d60861 (""skbuff: in skb_segment, call zerocopy functions
once per nskb"") added the call to zero copy functions in skb_segment().
The change introduced a bug in skb_segment() because skb_orphan_frags()
may possibly change the number of fragments or allocate new fragments
altogether leaving nrfrags and frag to point to the old values. This can
cause a panic with stacktrace like the one below.

I found that the read code might send multiple requests using the same

how we ended up occasionally double-freeing the scratch buffer, but also
means we set a NULL pointer but non-zero length to the xdr scratch
buffer. This results in an oops the first time decoding needs to copy
something to scratch, which frequently happens when decoding READ_PLUS
hole segments.

I fix this by moving scratch handling into the pageio read code. I
provide a function to allocate scratch space for decoding read replies,

The stack trace is a bit misleading as dw_pcie_host_deinit() doesn't
directly call pci_bus_release_domain_nr(). The issue turns out to be in
pci_remove_root_bus() which first calls pci_remove_bus() which frees the
struct pci_bus when its struct device is released. Then
pci_bus_release_domain_nr() is called and accesses the freed struct
pci_bus. Reordering these fixes the issue."

which is due to bio->bi_bdev being NULL. This can happen if we have two
tasks doing polled IO, and task B ends up completing IO from task A if
they are sharing a poll queue. If task B completes the IO and puts the
bio into our cache, then it can allocate that bio again before task A
is done polling for it. As that would necessitate a preempt between the
two tasks, it's enough to just be a bit more careful in checking for
whether or not bio->bi_bdev is NULL."

Based on above analysis, we can easily reproduce by following testcase:
  ``` bash
  #!/bin/bash

  dmesg -n 7
  sysctl -w kernel.panic_on_warn=1
  TR=/sys/kernel/tracing
  echo 7 > ${TR}/buffer_size_kb
  echo ""sched:sched_switch"" > ${TR}/set_event
  while [ true ]; do
          echo 1 > ${TR}/per_cpu/cpu0/snapshot
  done &
  while [ true ]; do
          echo 1 > ${TR}/per_cpu/cpu0/snapshot
  done &
  while [ true ]; do
          echo 1 > ${TR}/per_cpu/cpu0/snapshot
  done &
  ```

To fix it, IIUC, we can use smp_call_function_single() to do the swap on
the target cpu where the buffer is located, so that above race would be
avoided."

CVE-2025-59414	2025-09-17T19:15:47.437	2025-09-18T13:43:34.310	Nuxt is an open-source web development framework for Vue.js. Prior to 3.19.0 and 4.1.0, A client-side path traversal vulnerability in Nuxt's Island payload revival mechanism allowed attackers to manipulate client-side requests to different endpoints within the same application domain when specific prerendering conditions are met. The vulnerability occurs in the client-side payload revival process (revive-payload.client.ts) where Nuxt Islands are automatically fetched when encountering serialized __nuxt_island objects. During prerendering, if an API endpoint returns user-controlled data containing a crafted __nuxt_island object, he data gets serialized with devalue.stringify and stored in the prerendered page. When a client navigates to the prerendered page, devalue.parse deserializes the payload. The Island reviver attempts to fetch /__nuxt_island/${key}.json where key could contain path traversal sequences. Update to Nuxt 3.19.0+ or 4.1.0+.	3.1	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

CVE-2025-59340	2025-09-17T20:15:36.430	2025-09-26T13:11:40.227	jinjava is a Java-based template engine based on django template syntax, adapted to render jinja templates. Priori to 2.8.1, by using mapper.getTypeFactory().constructFromCanonical(), it is possible to instruct the underlying ObjectMapper to deserialize attacker-controlled input into arbitrary classes. This enables the creation of semi-arbitrary class instances without directly invoking restricted methods or class literals. As a result, an attacker can escape the sandbox and instantiate classes such as java.net.URL, opening up the ability to access local files and URLs(e.g., file:///etc/passwd). With further chaining, this primitive can potentially lead to remote code execution (RCE). This vulnerability is fixed in 2.8.1.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2025-59346	2025-09-17T20:15:36.683	2025-09-18T20:20:38.387	Dragonfly is an open source P2P-based file distribution and image acceleration system. Versions prior to 2.1.0 contain a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability that enables users to force DragonFly2’s components to make requests to internal services that are otherwise not accessible to them. The issue arises because the Manager API accepts a user-supplied URL when creating a Preheat job with weak validation, peers can trigger other peers to fetch an arbitrary URL through pieceManager.DownloadSource, and internal HTTP clients follow redirects, allowing a request to a malicious server to be redirected to internal services. This can be used to probe or access internal HTTP endpoints. The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.1.0.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

Prior to 2.1.0, The Manager disables TLS certificate verification in HTTP clients. The clients are not configurable, so users have no way to re-enable the verification. A Manager processes dozens of preheat jobs. An adversary performs a network-level Man-in-the-Middle attack, providing invalid data to the Manager. The Manager preheats with the wrong data, which later causes a denial of service and file integrity problems.

Prior to 2.1.0, the processPieceFromSource method does not update the structure’s usedTraffic field, because an uninitialized variable n is used as a guard to the AddTraffic method call, instead of the result.Size variable. A task is processed by a peer. The usedTraffic metadata is not updated during the processing. Rate limiting is incorrectly applied, leading to a denial-of-service condition for the peer.

Prior to 2.1.0, DragonFly2 uses the os.MkdirAll function to create certain directory paths with specific access permissions. This function does not perform any permission checks when a given directory path already exists. This allows a local attacker to create a directory to be used later by DragonFly2 with broad permissions before DragonFly2 does so, potentially allowing the attacker to tamper with the files.

Prior to 2.1.0, the gRPC API and HTTP APIs allow peers to send requests that force the recipient peer to create files in arbitrary file system locations, and to read arbitrary files. This allows peers to steal other peers’ secret data and to gain remote code execution (RCE) capabilities on the peer’s machine.This vulnerability is fixed in 2.1.0.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Prior to 2.1.0, a peer can obtain a valid TLS certificate for arbitrary IP addresses, effectively rendering the mTLS authentication useless. The issue is that the Manager’s Certificate gRPC service does not validate if the requested IP addresses “belong to” the peer requesting the certificate—that is, if the peer connects from the same IP address as the one provided in the certificate request.

tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: disable dma rx/tx use flags in lpuart_dma_shutdown

lpuart_dma_shutdown tears down lpuart dma, but lpuart_flush_buffer can
still occur which in turn tries to access dma apis if lpuart_dma_tx_use
flag is true. At this point since dma is torn down, these dma apis can
abort. Set lpuart_dma_tx_use and the corresponding rx flag
lpuart_dma_rx_use to false in lpuart_dma_shutdown so that dmas are not
accessed after they are relinquished.

Otherwise, when try to kill btattach, kernel may panic. This patch may
fix this issue.

CVE-2022-50379	2025-09-18T14:15:36.630	2025-09-19T16:00:46.437	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix race between quota enable and quota rescan ioctl

When enabling quotas, at btrfs_quota_enable(), after committing the
transaction, we change fs_info->quota_root to point to the quota root we
created and set BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED at fs_info->flags. Then we try
to start the qgroup rescan worker, first by initializing it with a call
to qgroup_rescan_init() - however if that fails we end up freeing the
quota root but we leave fs_info->quota_root still pointing to it, this
can later result in a use-after-free somewhere else.

We have previously set the flags BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED and
BTRFS_QGROUP_STATUS_FLAG_ON, so we can only fail with -EINPROGRESS at
btrfs_quota_enable(), which is possible if someone already called the
quota rescan ioctl, and therefore started the rescan worker.

So fix this by ignoring an -EINPROGRESS and asserting we can't get any
other error."

md: fix a crash in mempool_free

There's a crash in mempool_free when running the lvm test
shell/lvchange-rebuild-raid.sh.

The reason for the crash is this:
* super_written calls atomic_dec_and_test(&mddev->pending_writes) and
  wake_up(&mddev->sb_wait). Then it calls rdev_dec_pending(rdev, mddev)
  and bio_put(bio).
* so, the process that waited on sb_wait and that is woken up is racing
  with bio_put(bio).
* if the process wins the race, it calls bioset_exit before bio_put(bio)
  is executed.
* bio_put(bio) attempts to free a bio into a destroyed bio set - causing
  a crash in mempool_free.

We fix this bug by moving bio_put before atomic_dec_and_test.

We also move rdev_dec_pending before atomic_dec_and_test as suggested by
Neil Brown.

The function md_end_flush has a similar bug - we must call bio_put before
we decrement the number of in-progress bios.

====================================

Kernel uses tcindex_change() to change an existing
filter properties.

Yet the problem is that, during the process of changing,
if `old_r` is retrieved from `p->perfect`, then
kernel uses tcindex_alloc_perfect_hash() to newly
allocate filter results, uses tcindex_filter_result_init()
to clear the old filter result, without destroying
its tcf_exts structure, which triggers the above memory leak.

To be more specific, there are only two source for the `old_r`,
according to the tcindex_lookup(). `old_r` is retrieved from
`p->perfect`, or `old_r` is retrieved from `p->h`.

  * If `old_r` is retrieved from `p->perfect`, kernel uses
tcindex_alloc_perfect_hash() to newly allocate the
filter results. Then `r` is assigned with `cp->perfect + handle`,
which is newly allocated. So condition `old_r && old_r != r` is
true in this situation, and kernel uses tcindex_filter_result_init()
to clear the old filter result, without destroying
its tcf_exts structure

  * If `old_r` is retrieved from `p->h`, then `p->perfect` is NULL
according to the tcindex_lookup(). Considering that `cp->h`
is directly copied from `p->h` and `p->perfect` is NULL,
`r` is assigned with `tcindex_lookup(cp, handle)`, whose value
should be the same as `old_r`, so condition `old_r && old_r != r`
is false in this situation, kernel ignores using
tcindex_filter_result_init() to clear the old filter result.

So only when `old_r` is retrieved from `p->perfect` does kernel use
tcindex_filter_result_init() to clear the old filter result, which
triggers the above memory leak.

Considering that there already exists a tc_filter_wq workqueue
to destroy the old tcindex_d

drm/msm/dp: add atomic_check to bridge ops

DRM commit_tails() will disable downstream crtc/encoder/bridge if
both disable crtc is required and crtc->active is set before pushing
a new frame downstream.

There is a rare case that user space display manager issue an extra
screen update immediately followed by close DRM device while down
stream display interface is disabled. This extra screen update will
timeout due to the downstream interface is disabled but will cause
crtc->active be set. Hence the followed commit_tails() called by
drm_release() will pass the disable downstream crtc/encoder/bridge
conditions checking even downstream interface is disabled.
This cause the crash to happen at dp_bridge_disable() due to it trying
to access the main link register to push the idle pattern out while main
link clocks is disabled.

This patch adds atomic_check to prevent the extra frame will not
be pushed down if display interface is down so that crtc->active
will not be set neither. This will fail the conditions checking
of disabling down stream crtc/encoder/bridge which prevent
drm_release() from calling dp_bridge_disable() so that crash
at dp_bridge_disable() prevented.

There is no protection in the DRM framework to check if the display
pipeline has been already disabled before trying again. The only
check is the crtc_state->active but this is controlled by usermode
using UAPI. Hence if the usermode sets this and then crashes, the
driver needs to protect against double disable.

very real potential for this code to remove ALL debugfs entries from the

ever runs.  This all is very wrong as the greybus audio driver did not

scsi: mpi3mr: Use number of bits to manage bitmap sizes

To allocate bitmaps, the mpi3mr driver calculates sizes of bitmaps using
byte as unit. However, bitmap helper functions assume that bitmaps are
allocated using unsigned long as unit. This gap causes memory access beyond
the bitmap sizes and results in ""BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds"".  The BUG
was observed at firmware download to eHBA-9600. Call trace indicated that
the out-of-bounds access happened in find_first_zero_bit() called from

To fix the BUG, do not use bytes to manage bitmap sizes. Instead, use
number of bits, and call bitmap helper functions which take number of bits
as arguments. For memory allocation, call bitmap_zalloc() instead of
kzalloc() and krealloc(). For memory free, call bitmap_free() instead of
kfree(). For zero clear, call bitmap_clear() instead of memset().

During the CLC handshake, server sequentially tries available SMCRv2
and SMCRv1 devices in smc_listen_work().

If an SMCRv2 device is found. SMCv2 based link group and link will be
assigned to the connection. Then assumed that some buffer assignment
errors happen later in the CLC handshake, such as RMB registration
failure, server will give up SMCRv2 and try SMCRv1 device instead. But
the resources assigned to the connection won't be reset.

When server tries SMCRv1 device, the connection creation process will
be executed again. Since conn->lnk has been assigned when trying SMCRv2,
it will not be set to the correct SMCRv1 link in
smcr_lgr_conn_assign_link(). So in such situation, conn->lgr points to
correct SMCRv1 link group but conn->lnk points to the SMCRv2 link
mistakenly.

Then in smc_clc_send_confirm_accept(), conn->rmb_desc->mr[link->link_idx]
will be accessed. Since the link->link_idx is not correct, the related
MR may not have been initialized, so crash happens.

 | Try SMCRv2 device first
 |     |-> conn->lgr:	assign existed SMCRv2 link group;
 |     |-> conn->link:	assign existed SMCRv2 link (link_idx may be 1 in SMC_LGR_SYMMETRIC);
 |     |-> sndbuf & RMB creation fails, quit;
 |
 | Try SMCRv1 device then
 |     |-> conn->lgr:	create SMCRv1 link group and assign;
 |     |-> conn->link:	keep SMCRv2 link mistakenly;
 |     |-> sndbuf & RMB creation succeed, only RMB->mr[link_idx = 0]
 |         initialized.
 |
 | Then smc_clc_send_confirm_accept() accesses
 | conn->rmb_desc->mr[conn->link->link_idx, which is 1], then crash.
 v

This patch tries to fix this by cleaning conn->lnk before assigning
link. In addition, it is better to reset the connection and clean the
resources assigned if trying SMCRv2 failed in buffer creation or
registration."					
CVE-2023-53383	2025-09-18T14:15:41.310	2025-09-19T16:00:27.847	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

irqchip/gicv3: Workaround for NVIDIA erratum T241-FABRIC-4

The T241 platform suffers from the T241-FABRIC-4 erratum which causes
unexpected behavior in the GIC when multiple transactions are received
simultaneously from different sources. This hardware issue impacts
NVIDIA server platforms that use more than two T241 chips
interconnected. Each chip has support for 320 {E}SPIs.

This issue occurs when multiple packets from different GICs are
incorrectly interleaved at the target chip. The erratum text below
specifies exactly what can cause multiple transfer packets susceptible
to interleaving and GIC state corruption. GIC state corruption can
lead to a range of problems, including kernel panics, and unexpected
behavior.

>From the erratum text:
  ""In some cases, inter-socket AXI4 Stream packets with multiple
  transfers, may be interleaved by the fabric when presented to ARM
  Generic Interrupt Controller. GIC expects all transfers of a packet
  to be delivered without any interleaving.

  The following GICv3 commands may result in multiple transfer packets
  over inter-socket AXI4 Stream interface:
   - Register reads from GICD_I* and GICD_N*
   - Register writes to 64-bit GICD registers other than GICD_IROUTERn*
   - ITS command MOVALL

  Multiple commands in GICv4+ utilize multiple transfer packets,
  including VMOVP, VMOVI, VMAPP, and 64-bit register accesses.""

  This issue impacts system configurations with more than 2 sockets,
  that require multi-transfer packets to be sent over inter-socket
  AXI4 Stream interface between GIC instances on different sockets.
  GICv4 cannot be supported. GICv3 SW model can only be supported
  with the workaround. Single and Dual socket configurations are not
  impacted by this issue and support GICv3 and GICv4.""


Writing to the chip alias region of the GICD_In{E} registers except
GICD_ICENABLERn has an equivalent effect as writing to the global
distributor. The SPI interrupt deactivate path is not impacted by
the erratum.

To fix this problem, implement a workaround that ensures read accesses
to the GICD_In{E} registers are directed to the chip that owns the
SPI, and disable GICv4.x features. To simplify code changes, the
gic_configure_irq() function uses the same alias region for both read
and write operations to GICD_ICFGR."

HID: intel-ish-hid: Fix kernel panic during warm reset

During warm reset device->fw_client is set to NULL. If a bus driver is
registered after this NULL setting and before new firmware clients are
enumerated by ISHTP, kernel panic will result in the function
ishtp_cl_bus_match(). This is because of reference to
device->fw_client->props.protocol_name.

ISH firmware after getting successfully loaded, sends a warm reset
notification to remove all clients from the bus and sets
device->fw_client to NULL. Until kernel v5.15, all enabled ISHTP kernel
module drivers were loaded right after any of the first ISHTP device was
registered, regardless of whether it was a matched or an unmatched
device. This resulted in all drivers getting registered much before the
warm reset notification from ISH.

Starting kernel v5.16, this issue got exposed after the change was
introduced to load only bus drivers for the respective matching devices.
In this scenario, cros_ec_ishtp device and cros_ec_ishtp driver are
registered after the warm reset device fw_client NULL setting.
cros_ec_ishtp driver_register() triggers the callback to
ishtp_cl_bus_match() to match ISHTP driver to the device and causes kernel
panic in guid_equal() when dereferencing fw_client NULL pointer to get
protocol_name."

CVE-2022-50410	2025-09-18T16:15:44.260	2025-09-19T16:00:27.847	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSD: Protect against send buffer overflow in NFSv2 READ

Since before the git era, NFSD has conserved the number of pages
held by each nfsd thread by combining the RPC receive and send
buffers into a single array of pages. This works because there are
no cases where an operation needs a large RPC Call message and a
large RPC Reply at the same time.

Once an RPC Call has been received, svc_process() updates
svc_rqst::rq_res to describe the part of rq_pages that can be
used for constructing the Reply. This means that the send buffer
(rq_res) shrinks when the received RPC record containing the RPC
Call is large.

A client can force this shrinkage on TCP by sending a correctly-
formed RPC Call header contained in an RPC record that is
excessively large. The full maximum payload size cannot be
constructed in that case."

ACPICA: Fix error code path in acpi_ds_call_control_method()

A use-after-free in acpi_ps_parse_aml() after a failing invocaion of
acpi_ds_call_control_method() is reported by KASAN [1] and code
inspection reveals that next_walk_state pushed to the thread by
acpi_ds_create_walk_state() is freed on errors, but it is not popped
from the thread beforehand.  Thus acpi_ds_get_current_walk_state()
called by acpi_ps_parse_aml() subsequently returns it as the new
walk state which is incorrect.

To address this, make acpi_ds_call_control_method() call
acpi_ds_pop_walk_state() to pop next_walk_state from the thread before
returning an error."

The problem is that CPU2 accesses the rcu_node structure's->exp_tasks

not observe CPU1's change to rcu_node structure's ->exp_tasks in time.
Therefore, if CPU1 sets rcu_node structure's->exp_tasks pointer to NULL,
then CPU2 might dereference that NULL pointer.

This commit therefore holds the rcu_node structure's ->lock while
accessing that structure's->exp_tasks field.

When blkg_alloc() is called to allocate a blkcg_gq structure

Unfortunately those fields in the blkg_iostat_set's are not properly

xsk: Fix xsk_diag use-after-free error during socket cleanup

Fix a use-after-free error that is possible if the xsk_diag interface
is used after the socket has been unbound from the device. This can
happen either due to the socket being closed or the device
disappearing. In the early days of AF_XDP, the way we tested that a
socket was not bound to a device was to simply check if the netdevice
pointer in the xsk socket structure was NULL. Later, a better system
was introduced by having an explicit state variable in the xsk socket
struct. For example, the state of a socket that is on the way to being
closed and has been unbound from the device is XSK_UNBOUND.

The commit in the Fixes tag below deleted the old way of signalling
that a socket is unbound, setting dev to NULL. This in the belief that
all code using the old way had been exterminated. That was
unfortunately not true as the xsk diagnostics code was still using the
old way and thus does not work as intended when a socket is going
down. Fix this by introducing a test against the state variable. If
the socket is in the state XSK_UNBOUND, simply abort the diagnostic's
netlink operation."

powercap: arm_scmi: Remove recursion while parsing zones

Powercap zones can be defined as arranged in a hierarchy of trees and when
registering a zone with powercap_register_zone(), the kernel powercap
subsystem expects this to happen starting from the root zones down to the
leaves; on the other side, de-registration by powercap_deregister_zone()
must begin from the leaf zones.

Available SCMI powercap zones are retrieved dynamically from the platform
at probe time and, while any defined hierarchy between the zones is
described properly in the zones descriptor, the platform returns the
availables zones with no particular well-defined order: as a consequence,
the trees possibly composing the hierarchy of zones have to be somehow
walked properly to register the retrieved zones from the root.

Currently the ARM SCMI Powercap driver walks the zones using a recursive
algorithm; this approach, even though correct and tested can lead to kernel
stack overflow when processing a returned hierarchy of zones composed by
particularly high trees.

Avoid possible kernel stack overflow by substituting the recursive approach
with an iterative one supported by a dynamically allocated stack-like data
structure."

__extent_writepage currenly sets PageError whenever any error happens,
and the also checks for PageError to decide if to call error handling.
This leads to very unclear responsibility for cleaning up on errors.
In the VM and generic writeback helpers the basic idea is that once
I/O is fired off all error handling responsibility is delegated to the
end I/O handler.  But if that end I/O handler sets the PageError bit,
and the submitter checks it, the bit could in some cases leak into the
submission context for fast enough I/O.

Fix this by simply not checking PageError and just using the local
ret variable to check for submission errors.  This also fundamentally
solves the long problem documented in a comment in __extent_writepage
by never leaking the error bit into the submission context."

In ses_intf_add, components count could be 0, and kcalloc 0 size scomp,
but not saved in edev->component[i].scratch

In this situation, edev->component[0].scratch is an invalid pointer,
when kfree it in ses_intf_remove_enclosure, a crash like above would happen
The call trace also could be other random cases when kfree cannot catch
the invalid pointer

We should not use edev->component[] array when the components count is 0

net: add vlan_get_protocol_and_depth() helper

Before blamed commit, pskb_may_pull() was used instead
of skb_header_pointer() in __vlan_get_protocol() and friends.

Few callers depended on skb->head being populated with MAC header,
syzbot caught one of them (skb_mac_gso_segment())

Add vlan_get_protocol_and_depth() to make the intent clearer
and use it where sensible.

This is a more generic fix than commit e9d3f80935b6
(""net/af_packet: make sure to pull mac header"") which was
dealing with a similar issue.

x86/MCE: Always save CS register on AMD Zen IF Poison errors

The Instruction Fetch (IF) units on current AMD Zen-based systems do not
guarantee a synchronous #MC is delivered for poison consumption errors.
Therefore, MCG_STATUS[EIPV|RIPV] will not be set. However, the
microarchitecture does guarantee that the exception is delivered within
the same context. In other words, the exact rIP is not known, but the
context is known to not have changed.

There is no architecturally-defined method to determine this behavior.

The Code Segment (CS) register is always valid on such IF unit poison
errors regardless of the value of MCG_STATUS[EIPV|RIPV].

Add a quirk to save the CS register for poison consumption from the IF
unit banks.

This is needed to properly determine the context of the error.
Otherwise, the severity grading function will assume the context is
IN_KERNEL due to the m->cs value being 0 (the initialized value). This
leads to unnecessary kernel panics on data poison errors due to the
kernel believing the poison consumption occurred in kernel context."

CVE-2023-53440	2025-09-18T16:15:48.197	2025-09-19T16:00:27.847	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix sysfs interface lifetime

The current nilfs2 sysfs support has issues with the timing of creation
and deletion of sysfs entries, potentially leading to null pointer
dereferences, use-after-free, and lockdep warnings.

Some of the sysfs attributes for nilfs2 per-filesystem instance refer to
metadata file ""cpfile"", ""sufile"", or ""dat"", but
nilfs_sysfs_create_device_group that creates those attributes is executed
before the inodes for these metadata files are loaded, and
nilfs_sysfs_delete_device_group which deletes these sysfs entries is
called after releasing their metadata file inodes.

Therefore, access to some of these sysfs attributes may occur outside of
the lifetime of these metadata files, resulting in inode NULL pointer
dereferences or use-after-free.

In addition, the call to nilfs_sysfs_create_device_group() is made during
the locking period of the semaphore ""ns_sem"" of nilfs object, so the
shrinker call caused by the memory allocation for the sysfs entries, may
derive lock dependencies ""ns_sem"" -> (shrinker) -> ""locks acquired in
nilfs_evict_inode()"".

Since nilfs2 may acquire ""ns_sem"" deep in the call stack holding other
locks via its error handler __nilfs_error(), this causes lockdep to report
circular locking.  This is a false positive and no circular locking
actually occurs as no inodes exist yet when
nilfs_sysfs_create_device_group() is called.  Fortunately, the lockdep
warnings can be resolved by simply moving the call to
nilfs_sysfs_create_device_group() out of ""ns_sem"".

This fixes these sysfs issues by revising where the device's sysfs
interface is created/deleted and keeping its lifetime within the lifetime
of the metadata files above."

CVE-2023-53446	2025-09-18T16:15:48.940	2025-09-19T16:00:27.847	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI/ASPM: Disable ASPM on MFD function removal to avoid use-after-free

Struct pcie_link_state->downstream is a pointer to the pci_dev of function
0.  Previously we retained that pointer when removing function 0, and
subsequent ASPM policy changes dereferenced it, resulting in a
use-after-free warning from KASAN, e.g.:

  # echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:03:00.0/remove
  # echo powersave > /sys/module/pcie_aspm/parameters/policy

PCIe spec r6.0, sec 7.5.3.7, recommends that software program the same ASPM
Control value in all functions of multi-function devices.

Disable ASPM and free the pcie_link_state when any child function is
removed so we can discard the dangling pcie_link_state->downstream pointer
and maintain the same ASPM Control configuration for all functions.

The root cause is race condition as below:
- since it tries to remount rw filesystem, so that do_remount won't
call sb_prepare_remount_readonly to block fallocate, there may be race
condition in between remount and fallocate.
- in f2fs_remount(), default_options() will reset mount option to default
one, and then update it based on result of parse_options(), so there is
a hole which race condition can happen.

It turns out that the kernel panics while initializing vmemmap (struct
page array) when the vmemmap region spans two PGD entries, because the new
PGD entry is only installed in init_mm.pgd, but not in the page tables of
other tasks.

And looking at __populate_section_memmap():
  if (vmemmap_can_optimize(altmap, pgmap))                                
          // does not sync top level page tables
          r = vmemmap_populate_compound_pages(pfn, start, end, nid, pgmap);
  else                                                                    
          // sync top level page tables in x86
          r = vmemmap_populate(start, end, nid, altmap);

In the normal path, vmemmap_populate() in arch/x86/mm/init_64.c
synchronizes the top level page table (See commit 9b861528a801 (""x86-64,
mem: Update all PGDs for direct mapping and vmemmap mapping changes"")) so
that all tasks in the system can see the new vmemmap area.

However, when vmemmap_can_optimize() returns true, the optimized path
skips synchronization of top-level page tables.  This is because
vmemmap_populate_compound_pages() is implemented in core MM code, which
does not handle synchronization of the top-level page tables.  Instead,
the core MM has historically relied on each architecture to perform this
synchronization manually.

We're not the first party to encounter a crash caused by not-sync'd top
level page tables: earlier this year, Gwan-gyeong Mun attempted to address
the issue [1] [2] after hitting a kernel panic when x86 code accessed the
vmemmap area before the corresponding top-level entries were synced.  At
that time, the issue was believed to be triggered only when struct page
was enlarged for debugging purposes, and the patch did not get further
updates.

It turns out that current approach of relying on each arch to handle the
page table sync manually is fragile because 1) it's easy to forget to sync
the top level page table, and 2) it's also easy to overlook that the
kernel should not access the vmemmap and direct mapping areas before the
sync.

# The solution: Make page table sync more code robust and harder to miss

To address this, Dave Hansen suggested [3] [4] introducing
{pgd,p4d}_populate_kernel() for updating kernel portion of the page tables
and allow each architecture to explicitly perform synchronization when
installing top-level entries.  With this approach, we no longer need to
worry about missing the sync step, reducing the risk of future
regressions.

The new interface reuses existing ARCH_PAGE_TABLE_SYNC_MASK,
PGTBL_P*D_MODIFIED and arch_sync_kernel_mappings() facility used by
vmalloc and ioremap to synchronize page tables.

pgd_populate_kernel() looks like this:
static inline void pgd_populate_kernel(unsigned long addr, pgd_t *pgd,
                                       p4d_t *p4d)
{
        pgd_populate(&init_mm, pgd, p4d);
        if (ARCH_PAGE_TABLE_SYNC_MASK & PGTBL_PGD_MODIFIED)
                arch_sync_kernel_mappings(addr, addr);
}

It is worth noting that vmalloc() and apply_to_range() carefully
synchronizes page tables by calling p*d_alloc_track() and
arch_sync_kernel_mappings(), and thus they are not affected by

Define ARCH_PAGE_TABLE_SYNC_MASK and arch_sync_kernel_mappings() to ensure

For 5-level paging, synchronization is performed via
pgd_populate_kernel().  In 4-level paging, pgd_populate() is a no-op, so
synchronization is instead performed at the P4D level via
p4d_populate_kernel().

This fixes intermittent boot failures on systems using 4-level paging and

vxlan: Fix NPD in {arp,neigh}_reduce() when using nexthop objects

When the ""proxy"" option is enabled on a VXLAN device, the device will
suppress ARP requests and IPv6 Neighbor Solicitation messages if it is
able to reply on behalf of the remote host. That is, if a matching and
valid neighbor entry is configured on the VXLAN device whose MAC address
is not behind the ""any"" remote (0.0.0.0 / ::).

The code currently assumes that the FDB entry for the neighbor's MAC
address points to a valid remote destination, but this is incorrect if
the entry is associated with an FDB nexthop group. This can result in a
NPD [1][3] which can be reproduced using [2][4].

Fix by checking that the remote destination exists before dereferencing
it.

However, when learning is enabled, an incoming packet might try to
refresh an FDB entry that points to an FDB nexthop group and therefore
does not have a remote. Such packets should be dropped, but they are
only dropped after dereferencing the non-existent remote, resulting in a
NPD [1] which can be reproduced using [2].

Fix by dropping such packets earlier. Remove the misleading comment from
first_remote_rcu().

free'd.

tcp_v4_syn_recv_sock() makes this very clear by having the put_and_exit

tcp_v4_syn_recv_sock and tcp_v6_syn_recv_sock have similar

wifi: brcmfmac: fix use-after-free when rescheduling brcmf_btcoex_info work

The brcmf_btcoex_detach() only shuts down the btcoex timer, if the
flag timer_on is false. However, the brcmf_btcoex_timerfunc(), which
runs as timer handler, sets timer_on to false. This creates critical
race conditions:

1.If brcmf_btcoex_detach() is called while brcmf_btcoex_timerfunc()
is executing, it may observe timer_on as false and skip the call to
timer_shutdown_sync().

2.The brcmf_btcoex_timerfunc() may then reschedule the brcmf_btcoex_info
worker after the cancel_work_sync() has been executed, resulting in
use-after-free bugs.

The use-after-free bugs occur in two distinct scenarios, depending on
the timing of when the brcmf_btcoex_info struct is freed relative to
the execution of its worker thread.

Scenario 1: Freed before the worker is scheduled

The brcmf_btcoex_info is deallocated before the worker is scheduled.
A race condition can occur when schedule_work(&bt_local->work) is
called after the target memory has been freed. The sequence of events
is detailed below:

CPU0                           | CPU1
brcmf_btcoex_detach            | brcmf_btcoex_timerfunc
                               |   bt_local->timer_on = false;
  if (cfg->btcoex->timer_on)   |
    ...                        |
  cancel_work_sync();          |
  ...                          |
  kfree(cfg->btcoex); // FREE  |
                               |   schedule_work(&bt_local->work); // USE

Scenario 2: Freed after the worker is scheduled

The brcmf_btcoex_info is freed after the worker has been scheduled
but before or during its execution. In this case, statements within
the brcmf_btcoex_handler() — such as the container_of macro and
subsequent dereferences of the brcmf_btcoex_info object will cause
a use-after-free access. The following timeline illustrates this
scenario:

CPU0                            | CPU1
brcmf_btcoex_detach             | brcmf_btcoex_timerfunc
                                |   bt_local->timer_on = false;
  if (cfg->btcoex->timer_on)    |
    ...                         |
  cancel_work_sync();           |
  ...                           |   schedule_work(); // Reschedule
                                |
  kfree(cfg->btcoex); // FREE   |   brcmf_btcoex_handler() // Worker
  /*                            |     btci = container_of(....); // USE
   The kfree() above could      |     ...
   also occur at any point      |     btci-> // USE
   during the worker's execution|
   */                           |

To resolve the race conditions, drop the conditional check and call
timer_shutdown_sync() directly. It can deactivate the timer reliably,
regardless of its current state. Once stopped, the timer_on state is

A server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the favicon extraction feature of AliasVault API versions 0.23.0 and lower. The extractor fetches a user-supplied URL, parses the returned HTML, and follows <link rel=""icon"" href=""…"">. Although the initial URL is validated to allow only HTTP/HTTPS with default ports, the extractor automatically follows redirects and does not block requests to loopback or internal IP ranges. An authenticated, low-privileged user can exploit this behavior to coerce the backend into making HTTP(S) requests to arbitrary internal hosts and non-default ports. If the target host serves a favicon or any other valid image, the response is returned to the attacker in Base64 form. Even when no data is returned, timing and error behavior can be abused to map internal services.

The software stores IPC request and response files inside /opt/PrinterInstallerClient/tmp with world-readable and world-writable permissions. Any local user can craft malicious request files that are processed by privileged daemons, leading to unauthorized actions being executed in other user sessions. This breaks user session isolation, potentially allowing local attackers to hijack sessions, perform unintended actions in the context of other users, and impact system integrity and availability. This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2022-004 — Client Inter-process Security.	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

The service requires root privileges for certain administrative operations, but these checks rely on calls to geteuid(). By preloading a malicious shared object overriding geteuid(), a local attacker can trick the service into believing it is running with root privileges. This bypass enables execution of administrative commands (e.g., enabling debug mode, managing configurations, or invoking privileged features) without proper authorization. While some actions requiring write access to protected files may still fail, the flaw effectively breaks the intended security model of the inter-process communication (IPC) system, allowing local attackers to escalate privileges and compromise system integrity. This vulnerability has been confirmed to be remediated, but it is unclear as to when the patch was introduced.	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Several of these processes run with elevated privileges (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM for PrinterInstallerClient.exe and PrinterInstallerClientLauncher.exe), and the client automatically downloads and installs printer drivers. The absence of modern memory safety mitigations and the use of unmaintained runtimes substantially increase the risk that memory-corruption or other exploit primitives — for example from crafted driver content or maliciously crafted inputs — can be turned into remote or local code execution and privilege escalation to SYSTEM. This vulnerability has been confirmed to be remediated, but it is unclear as to when the patch was introduced.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2025-34194	2025-09-19T19:15:39.970	2025-09-29T20:15:32.087	Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host versions prior to 25.1.102 and Application versions prior to 25.1.1413 (Windows client deployments) contain an insecure temporary-file handling vulnerability in the PrinterInstallerClient components. The software creates files as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM inside a directory under the control of the local user (C:\Users\%USER%\AppData\Local\Temp\). An attacker who can place symbolic links or otherwise influence filenames in that directory can cause the service to follow the link and write to arbitrary filesystem locations as SYSTEM. This allows a local, unprivileged user to overwrite or create files as SYSTEM, leading to local privilege escalation and the ability to modify configuration files, replace or inject binaries, or otherwise compromise confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. This vulnerability has been confirmed to be remediated, but it is unclear as to when the patch was introduced.	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2025-34195	2025-09-19T19:15:40.123	2025-10-02T22:15:36.440	"Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host versions prior to 1.0.735 and Application prior to 20.0.1330 (Windows client deployments) contain a remote code execution vulnerability during driver installation caused by unquoted program paths. The PrinterInstallerClient driver-installation component launches programs using an unquoted path under ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Printer Properties Pro\Printer Installer"". Because the path is unquoted, the operating system may execute a program located at a short-path location such as C:\Program.exe before the intended binaries in the quoted path. If an attacker can place or cause a program to exist at that location, it will be executed with the privileges of the installer process (which may be elevated), enabling arbitrary code execution and potential privilege escalation. This weakness can be used to achieve remote code execution and full compromise of affected Windows endpoints. This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2022-006 — Driver Upload Security."	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

The same private host keys (RSA, ECDSA, and ED25519) are present across installations, rather than being uniquely generated per appliance. An attacker who obtains these private keys (for example from one compromised appliance image or another installation) can impersonate the appliance, decrypt or intercept SSH connections to appliances that use the same keys, and perform man-in-the-middle or impersonation attacks against administrative SSH sessions. This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-011 — Hardcoded SSH Host Key.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2025-34199	2025-09-19T19:15:40.580	2025-10-02T22:15:36.973	Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host versions prior to 22.0.1049 and Application versions prior to 20.0.2786 (VA and SaaS deployments) contain insecure defaults and code patterns that disable TLS/SSL certificate verification for communications to printers and internal microservices. In multiple places, the application sets libcurl/PHP transport options such that CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST and CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER are effectively disabled, and environment variables (for example API_*_VERIFYSSL=false) are used to turn off verification for gateway and microservice endpoints. As a result, the client accepts TLS connections without validating server certificates (and, in some cases, uses clear-text HTTP), permitting on-path attackers to perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. An attacker able to intercept network traffic between the product and printers or microservices can eavesdrop on and modify sensitive data (including print jobs, configuration, and authentication tokens), inject malicious payloads, or disrupt service. This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-024 — Insecure Communication to Printers & Microservices.	8.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2025-34202	2025-09-19T19:15:41.040	2025-10-02T22:15:37.107	Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to 25.2.169 and Application prior to 25.2.1518 (VA and SaaS deployments) expose Docker internal networks in a way that allows an attacker on the same external L2 segment — or an attacker able to add routes using the appliance as a gateway — to reach container IPs directly. This grants access to internal services (HTTP APIs, Redis, MySQL, etc.) that are intended to be isolated inside the container network. Many of those services are accessible without authentication or are vulnerable to known exploitation chains. As a result, compromise of a single reachable endpoint or basic network access can enable lateral movement, remote code execution, data exfiltration, and full system compromise. This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2025-003 — Insecure Access to Docker Instance from WAN.	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

A script named /var/www/app/resetroot.php (found in several containers) lacks authentication checks and, when executed, performs a SQL update that sets the database administrator username to 'root' and its password hash to the SHA-512 hash of the string 'password'. Separately, commented-out code in /var/www/app/lib/common/oses.php would unserialize session data (unserialize($_SESSION['osdata']))—a pattern that can enable remote code execution if re-enabled or reached with attacker-controlled serialized data. An attacker able to reach the resetroot.php endpoint can trivially reset the MySQL root password and obtain full database control; combined with deserialization issues this can lead to full remote code execution and system compromise. This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2023-003 — Dead / Insecure PHP Code.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2025-57433	2025-09-22T16:15:44.890	2025-09-23T19:15:40.597	The 2wcom IP-4c 2.15.5 device's web interface includes an information disclosure vulnerability. By sending a crafted POST request to a specific endpoint (/cwi/ajax_request/get_data.php), an authenticated attacker (even with a low-privileged account like guest) can retrieve the hashed passwords for the admin, manager, and guest accounts. This significantly weakens the system's security posture, as these hashes could be cracked offline, granting attackers administrative access to the device.	6.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2025-57601	2025-09-22T16:15:45.000	2025-09-23T19:15:40.790	"AiKaan Cloud Controller uses a single hardcoded SSH private key and the username `proxyuser` for remote terminal access to all managed IoT/edge devices. When an administrator initiates ""Open Remote Terminal"" from the AiKaan dashboard, the controller sends this same static private key to the target device. The device then uses it to establish a reverse SSH tunnel to a remote access server, enabling browser-based SSH access for the administrator. Because the same `proxyuser` account and SSH key are reused across all customer environments: - An attacker who obtains the key (e.g., by intercepting it in transit, extracting it from the remote access server, or from a compromised admin account) can impersonate any managed device. - They can establish unauthorized reverse SSH tunnels and interact with devices without the owner's consent. This is a design flaw in the authentication model: compromise of a single key compromises the trust boundary between the controller and devices."	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Prior to version 6.5.11, there is an absence of automatic session expiration following a user's password change. This oversight poses a security risk, as if a user forgets to log out from a location where they accessed their account, an unauthorized user can maintain access even after the password has been changed. Due to this bug, if an account has already been compromised, the legitimate user has no way to revoke the attacker’s access. The malicious actor retains full access to the account until their session naturally expires. This means the account remains insecure even after the password has been changed.

CVE-2025-57203	2025-09-22T20:15:38.483	2025-10-03T17:49:07.950	MagicProject AI version 9.1 is affected by a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the chatbot generation feature available to authenticated admin users. The vulnerability resides in the prompt parameter submitted to the /dashboard/user/generator/generate-stream endpoint via a multipart/form-data POST request. Due to insufficient input sanitization, attackers can inject HTML-based JavaScript payloads. This payload is stored and rendered unsanitized in subsequent views, leading to execution in other users' browsers when they access affected content. This issue allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of another user, potentially leading to session hijacking, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or administrative account takeover. The application does not implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) or adequate input filtering to prevent such attacks. A fix should include proper sanitization, output encoding, and strong CSP enforcement to mitigate exploitation.	4.8	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N		
CVE-2025-59432	2025-09-22T20:15:38.673	2025-09-22T21:22:16.313	SCRAM (Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism) is part of the family of Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL, RFC 4422) authentication mechanisms. Prior to version 3.2, a timing attack vulnerability exists in the SCRAM Java implementation. The issue arises because Arrays.equals was used to compare secret values such as client proofs and server signatures. Since Arrays.equals performs a short-circuit comparison, the execution time varies depending on how many leading bytes match. This behavior could allow an attacker to perform a timing side-channel attack and potentially infer sensitive authentication material. All users relying on SCRAM authentication are impacted. This vulnerability has been patched in version 3.1 by replacing Arrays.equals with MessageDigest.isEqual, which ensures constant-time comparison.					
CVE-2025-59433	2025-09-22T20:15:38.837	2025-09-22T21:22:16.313	Conventional Changelog generates changelogs and release notes from a project's commit messages and metadata. Prior to version 2.0.0, @conventional-changelog/git-client has an argument injection vulnerability. This vulnerability manifests with the library's getTags() API, which allows extra parameters to be passed to the git log command. In another API by this library, getRawCommits(), there are secure practices taken to ensure that the extra parameter path is unable to inject an argument by ending the git log command with the special shell syntax --. However, the library does not follow the same practice for getTags() as it does not attempt to sanitize for user input, validate the given params, or restrict them to an allow list. Nor does it properly pass command-line flags to the git binary using the double-dash POSIX characters (--) to communicate the end of options. Thus, allowing users to exploit an argument injection vulnerability in Git due to the --output= command-line option that results with overwriting arbitrary files. This issue has been patched in version 2.0.0.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H

In version 3.0.5, Flowise is vulnerable to remote code execution. The CustomMCP node allows users to input configuration settings for connecting to an external MCP server. This node parses the user-provided mcpServerConfig string to build the MCP server configuration. However, during this process, it executes JavaScript code without any security validation. Specifically, inside the convertToValidJSONString function, user input is directly passed to the Function() constructor, which evaluates and executes the input as JavaScript code. Since this runs with full Node.js runtime privileges, it can access dangerous modules such as child_process and fs.

CVE-2025-57204	2025-09-22T21:15:59.757	2025-10-03T17:45:38.487	Stocky POS with Inventory Management & HRM (ui-lib) version 5.0 is affected by a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the Products module available to authenticated users. The vulnerability resides in the product name parameter submitted to the product-creation endpoint via a standard POST form. Due to insufficient input sanitization and output encoding, attackers can inject HTML/JS payloads. The payload is stored and subsequently rendered unsanitized in downstream views, leading to JavaScript execution in other users' browsers when they access the affected product pages. This issue allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of another user, potentially enabling session hijacking, privilege escalation within the application, data exfiltration, or administrative account takeover. The application also lacks a restrictive Content Security Policy (CSP), increasing exploitability.	5.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

The vulnerability resides in POSTed editor parameters submitted to the /posts/edit/{id} endpoint (and similarly in Notice and Pages editors). Due to insufficient input sanitization and output encoding, attackers can inject HTML/JS payloads. The payload is saved and later rendered unsanitized, resulting in JavaScript execution in other users' browsers when they access the affected content. This issue allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of another user, potentially leading to session hijacking, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or administrative account takeover. The application does not enforce a restrictive Content Security Policy (CSP) or adequate filtering to prevent such attacks.	5.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N		
CVE-2025-59532	2025-09-22T21:16:00.130	2025-09-22T21:22:16.313	Codex CLI is a coding agent from OpenAI that runs locally. In versions 0.2.0 to 0.38.0, due to a bug in the sandbox configuration logic, Codex CLI could treat a model-generated cwd as the sandbox’s writable root, including paths outside of the folder where the user started their session. This logic bypassed the intended workspace boundary and enables arbitrary file writes and command execution where the Codex process has permissions - this did not impact the network-disabled sandbox restriction. This issue has been patched in Codex CLI 0.39.0 that canonicalizes and validates that the boundary used for sandbox policy is based on where the user started the session, and not the one generated by the model. Users running 0.38.0 or earlier should update immediately via their package manager or by reinstalling the latest Codex CLI to ensure sandbox boundaries are enforced. If using the Codex IDE extension, users should immediately update to 0.4.12 for a fix of the sandbox issue.

dmaengine: ti: edma: Fix memory allocation size for queue_priority_map

Fix a critical memory allocation bug in edma_setup_from_hw() where
queue_priority_map was allocated with insufficient memory. The code
declared queue_priority_map as s8 (*)[2] (pointer to array of 2 s8),
but allocated memory using sizeof(s8) instead of the correct size.

This caused out-of-bounds memory writes when accessing:
  queue_priority_map[i][0] = i;
  queue_priority_map[i][1] = i;

The bug manifested as kernel crashes with ""Oops - undefined instruction""
on ARM platforms (BeagleBoard-X15) during EDMA driver probe, as the
memory corruption triggered kernel hardening features on Clang.

Change the allocation to use sizeof(*queue_priority_map) which
automatically gets the correct size for the 2D array structure."

dmaengine: idxd: Fix double free in idxd_setup_wqs()

The clean up in idxd_setup_wqs() has had a couple bugs because the error
handling is a bit subtle.  It's simpler to just re-write it in a cleaner
way.  The issues here are:

1) If ""idxd->max_wqs"" is <= 0 then we call put_device(conf_dev) when
   ""conf_dev"" hasn't been initialized.
2) If kzalloc_node() fails then again ""conf_dev"" is invalid.  It's
   either uninitialized or it points to the ""conf_dev"" from the
   previous iteration so it leads to a double free.

It's better to free partial loop iterations within the loop and then
the unwinding at the end can handle whole loop iterations.  I also
renamed the labels to describe what the goto does and not where the goto
was located."

always returns 0 (= success) because it first NULLs the pointer and
then returns PTR_ERR(NULL) which is always 0.  This means errors are
silently ignored, leaving NULL entries in the page array, which may
later crash the kernel.

The simple solution is to call PTR_ERR() before clearing the pointer."					
CVE-2025-39879	2025-09-23T06:15:47.523	2025-09-24T18:11:24.520	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ceph: always call ceph_shift_unused_folios_left()

The function ceph_process_folio_batch() sets folio_batch entries to
NULL, which is an illegal state.  Before folio_batch_release() crashes
due to this API violation, the function ceph_shift_unused_folios_left()
is supposed to remove those NULLs from the array.

However, since commit ce80b76dd327 (""ceph: introduce
ceph_process_folio_batch() method""), this shifting doesn't happen
anymore because the ""for"" loop got moved to ceph_process_folio_batch(),
and now the `i` variable that remains in ceph_writepages_start()
doesn't get incremented anymore, making the shifting effectively
unreachable much of the time.

Later, commit 1551ec61dc55 (""ceph: introduce ceph_submit_write()
method"") added more preconditions for doing the shift, replacing the
`i` check (with something that is still just as broken):

- if ceph_process_folio_batch() fails, shifting never happens

- if ceph_move_dirty_page_in_page_array() was never called (because
  ceph_process_folio_batch() has returned early for some of various
  reasons), shifting never happens

- if `processed_in_fbatch` is zero (because ceph_process_folio_batch()
  has returned early for some of the reasons mentioned above or
  because ceph_move_dirty_page_in_page_array() has failed), shifting
  never happens

Since those two commits, any problem in ceph_process_folio_batch()
could crash the kernel, e.g. this way:

The crash can be reproduced easily by changing the
ceph_check_page_before_write() return value to `-E2BIG`.

(Interestingly, the crash happens only if `huge_zero_folio` has
already been allocated; without `huge_zero_folio`,
is_huge_zero_folio(NULL) returns true and folios_put_refs() skips NULL
entries instead of dereferencing them.  That makes reproducing the bug
somewhat unreliable.  See
https://lore.kernel.org/20250826231626.218675-1-max.kellermann@ionos.com
for a discussion of this detail.)

My suggestion is to move the ceph_shift_unused_folios_left() to right
after ceph_process_folio_batch() to ensure it always gets called to
fix up the illegal folio_batch state."

There is a place where generic code in messenger.c is reading and
another place where it is writing to con->v1 union member without
checking that the union member is active (i.e. msgr1 is in use).

On 64-bit systems, con->v1.auth_retry overlaps with con->v2.out_iter,
so such a read is almost guaranteed to return a bogus value instead of
0 when msgr2 is in use.  This ends up being fairly benign because the
side effect is just the invalidation of the authorizer and successive
fetching of new tickets.

con->v1.connect_seq overlaps with con->v2.conn_bufs and the fact that
it's being written to can cause more serious consequences, but luckily

Reproduction Steps:
1. Open test/cpu.pressure and establish epoll monitoring
2. Disable monitoring: echo 0 > test/cgroup.pressure
3. Re-enable monitoring: echo 1 > test/cgroup.pressure

The race condition occurs because:
1. When cgroup.pressure is disabled (echo 0 > cgroup.pressure), it:
   - Releases PSI triggers via cgroup_file_release()
   - Frees of->priv through kernfs_drain_open_files()
2. While epoll still holds reference to the file and continues polling
3. Re-enabling (echo 1 > cgroup.pressure) accesses freed of->priv

To address this issue, introduce kernfs_get_active_of() for kernfs open

The root cause is that unpoison_memory() tries to check the PG_HWPoison
flags of an uninitialized page.  So VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(PagePoisoned(page)) is
triggered.  This can be reproduced by below steps:

1.Offline memory block:

 echo offline > /sys/devices/system/memory/memory12/state

2.Get offlined memory pfn:

 page-types -b n -rlN

3.Write pfn to unpoison-pfn

 echo <pfn> > /sys/kernel/debug/hwpoison/unpoison-pfn

This scenario can be identified by pfn_to_online_page() returning NULL. 
And ZONE_DEVICE pages are never expected, so we can simply fail if
pfn_to_online_page() == NULL to fix the bug."

btrfs: fix subvolume deletion lockup caused by inodes xarray race

There is a race condition between inode eviction and inode caching that
can cause a live struct btrfs_inode to be missing from the root->inodes
xarray. Specifically, there is a window during evict() between the inode
being unhashed and deleted from the xarray. If btrfs_iget() is called
for the same inode in that window, it will be recreated and inserted
into the xarray, but then eviction will delete the new entry, leaving
nothing in the xarray:

  destroy_inode()
    btrfs_destroy_inode()
      btrfs_del_inode_from_root()
        __xa_erase

In turn, this can cause issues for subvolume deletion. Specifically, if
an inode is in this lost state, and all other inodes are evicted, then
btrfs_del_inode_from_root() will call btrfs_add_dead_root() prematurely.
If the lost inode has a delayed_node attached to it, then when
btrfs_clean_one_deleted_snapshot() calls btrfs_kill_all_delayed_nodes(),
it will loop forever because the delayed_nodes xarray will never become
empty (unless memory pressure forces the inode out). We saw this
manifest as soft lockups in production.

Fix it by only deleting the xarray entry if it matches the given inode
(using __xa_cmpxchg())."

ocfs2_fiemap() takes a read lock of the ip_alloc_sem semaphore (since
v2.6.22-527-g7307de80510a) and calls fiemap_fill_next_extent() to read the
extent list of this running mmap executable.  The user supplied buffer to
hold the fiemap information page faults calling ocfs2_page_mkwrite() which
will take a write lock (since v2.6.27-38-g00dc417fa3e7) of the same
semaphore.  This recursive semaphore will hold filesystem locks and causes
a hang of the fileystem.

The ip_alloc_sem protects the inode extent list and size.  Release the
read semphore before calling fiemap_fill_next_extent() in ocfs2_fiemap()

CVE-2025-39886	2025-09-23T06:15:48.680	2025-09-24T18:11:24.520	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Tell memcg to use allow_spinning=false path in bpf_timer_init()

Currently, calling bpf_map_kmalloc_node() from __bpf_async_init() can
cause various locking issues; see the following stack trace (edited for
style) as one example:

 [10.011629]  sched_ttwu_pending         (1) grabs rq_lock
...

The above was reproduced on bpf-next (b338cf849ec8) by modifying
./tools/sched_ext/scx_flatcg.bpf.c to call bpf_timer_init() during
ops.runnable(), and hacking the memcg accounting code a bit to make
a bpf_timer_init() call more likely to raise an MEMCG_MAX event.

We have also run into other similar variants (both internally and on
bpf-next), including double-acquiring cgroup_file_kn_lock, the same
worker_pool::lock, etc.

As suggested by Shakeel, fix this by using __GFP_HIGH instead of
GFP_ATOMIC in __bpf_async_init(), so that e.g. if try_charge_memcg()
raises an MEMCG_MAX event, we call __memcg_memory_event() with
@allow_spinning=false and avoid calling cgroup_file_notify() there.

In versions 0.5.3 and earlier of astral-tokio-tar, tar archives may extract outside of their intended destination directory when using the Entry::unpack_in_raw API. Additionally, the Entry::allow_external_symlinks control (which defaults to true) could be bypassed via a pair of symlinks that individually point within the destination but combine to point outside of it. These behaviors could be used individually or combined to bypass the intended security control of limiting extraction to the given directory. This in turn would allow an attacker with a malicious tar archive to perform an arbitrary file write and potentially pivot into code execution. This issue has been patched in version 0.5.4.

An authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in Horilla 1.3.0 due to the unsafe use of Python’s eval() function on a user-controlled query parameter in the project_bulk_archive view. This allows privileged users (e.g., administrators) to execute arbitrary system commands on the server. While having Django’s DEBUG=True makes exploitation visibly easier by returning command output in the HTTP response, this is not required.

Mitigations include upgrading to a version of pip that includes the fix, upgrading to a Python version that implements PEP 706 (Python >=3.9.17, >=3.10.12, >=3.11.4, or >=3.12),
applying the linked patch, or inspecting source distributions (sdists) before installation as is already a best-practice."					
CVE-2025-10360	2025-09-24T16:15:32.797	2025-09-24T18:11:24.520	In Puppet Enterprise versions 2025.4.0 and 2025.5, the encryption key used for encrypting content in the Infra Assistant database was not excluded from the files gathered by Puppet backup. The key is only present on the system if the user has a Puppet Enterprise Advanced license and has enabled the Infra Assistant feature. The key is used for encrypting one particular bit of data in the Infra Assistant database: the API key for their AI provider account. This has been fixed in Puppet Enterprise version 2025.6, and release notes for 2025.6 have remediation steps for users of affected versions who can't update to the latest version.

CVE-2020-36851	2025-09-25T15:16:01.503	2025-09-26T14:32:53.583	Rob -- W / cors-anywhere instances configured as an open proxy allow unauthenticated external users to induce the server to make HTTP requests to arbitrary targets (SSRF). Because the proxy forwards requests and headers, an attacker can reach internal-only endpoints and link-local metadata services, retrieve instance role credentials or other sensitive metadata, and interact with internal APIs and services that are not intended to be internet-facing. The vulnerability is exploitable by sending crafted requests to the proxy with the target resource encoded in the URL; many cors-anywhere deployments forward arbitrary methods and headers (including PUT), which can permit exploitation of IMDSv2 workflows as well as access to internal management APIs. Successful exploitation can result in theft of cloud credentials, unauthorized access to internal services, remote code execution or privilege escalation (depending on reachable backends), data exfiltration, and full compromise of cloud resources. Mitigation includes: restricting the proxy to trusted origins or authentication, whitelisting allowed target hosts, preventing access to link-local and internal IP ranges, removing support for unsafe HTTP methods/headers, enabling cloud provider mitigations, and deploying network-level protections.

CVE-2025-59830	2025-09-25T15:16:13.780	2025-10-10T16:43:14.337	Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Prior to version 2.2.18, Rack::QueryParser enforces its params_limit only for parameters separated by &, while still splitting on both & and ;. As a result, attackers could use ; separators to bypass the parameter count limit and submit more parameters than intended. Applications or middleware that directly invoke Rack::QueryParser with its default configuration (no explicit delimiter) could be exposed to increased CPU and memory consumption. This can be abused as a limited denial-of-service vector. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.18.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Prior to Apollo Sandbox version 2.7.2 and Apollo Explorer version 3.7.3, a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability was identified. The vulnerability arises from missing origin validation in the client-side code that handles window.postMessage events. A malicious website can send forged messages to the embedding page, causing the victim’s browser to execute arbitrary GraphQL queries or mutations against their GraphQL server while authenticated with the victim’s cookies. This issue has been patched in Apollo Sandbox version 2.7.2 and Apollo Explorer version 3.7.3.	8.2	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N

CVE-2025-59936	2025-09-27T01:15:43.590	2025-09-29T19:34:10.030	get-jwks contains fetch utils for JWKS keys. In versions prior to 11.0.2, a vulnerability in get-jwks can lead to cache poisoning in the JWKS key-fetching mechanism. When the iss (issuer) claim is validated only after keys are retrieved from the cache, it is possible for cached keys from an unexpected issuer to be reused, resulting in a bypass of issuer validation. This design flaw enables a potential attack where a malicious actor crafts a pair of JWTs, the first one ensuring that a chosen public key is fetched and stored in the shared JWKS cache, and the second one leveraging that cached key to pass signature validation for a targeted iss value. The vulnerability will work only if the iss validation is done after the use of get-jwks for keys retrieval. This issue has been patched in version 11.0.2.

These settings disable verification of the remote host’s SSH key and automatically forward the developer’s SSH‑agent to any host that matches the configured wildcard patterns.  As a result, an attacker who can reach a single compromised container can cause the container to connect to a malicious SSH server, capture the forwarded private keys, and use those keys for unrestricted lateral movement across the environment. This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-027 — Insecure Secure Shell (SSH) Configuration.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Because the key is hardcoded, any attacker who can gain container-level access can simply read the files and obtain the private key. With the private key, the attacker can decrypt TLS traffic, perform man-in-the-middle attacks, or forge TLS certificates. This enables impersonation of the appliance’s web UI, interception of credentials, and unrestricted access to any services that trust the certificate.

Because the APP_KEY is required to generate valid signed requests, an attacker who obtains it can craft malicious payloads that are accepted by the application and achieve remote code execution on the appliance. This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-018 — RCE & Leaks via API.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2025-34218	2025-09-29T21:15:35.450	2025-10-09T18:04:33.063	Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to version 22.0.1049 and Application prior to version 20.0.2786 (VA/SaaS deployments) expose internal Docker containers through the gw Docker instance.  The gateway publishes a /meta endpoint which lists every micro‑service container together with version information. These containers are reachable directly over HTTP/HTTPS without any access‑control list (ACL), authentication or rate‑limiting. Consequently, any attacker on the LAN or the Internet can enumerate all internal services and their versions, interact with the exposed APIs of each microservice as an unauthenticated user, or issue malicious requests that may lead to information disclosure, privilege escalation within the container, or denial‑of‑service of the entire appliance. The root cause is the absence of authentication and network‑level restrictions on the API‑gateway’s proxy to internal Docker containers, effectively turning the internal service mesh into a public attack surface. This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-030 — Exposed Internal Docker Instance (LAN).	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2025-34220	2025-09-29T21:15:35.600	2025-10-09T18:05:10.110	Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host prior to version 25.1.102 and Application prior to version 25.1.1413 (VA/SaaS deployments) contains a /api-gateway/identity/search-groups endpoint that does not require authentication. Requests to https://<tenant>.printercloud10.com/api-gateway/identity/search-groups and adjustments to the `Host` header allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to enumerate every group object stored for that tenant.  The response includes internal identifiers (group ID, source service ID, Azure AD object IDs, creation timestamps, and tenant IDs). This vulnerability has been confirmed to be remediated, but it is unclear as to when the patch was introduced.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

An unauthenticated attacker can therefore upload a new TLS/SSL certificate replacing the trusted root used by the appliance, delete an existing certificate causing immediate loss of trust for services that rely on it, or download any stored CA or client certificate via the service‑clients endpoint which also suffers an IDOR that allows enumeration of all client IDs. This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-028 — Unauthenticated Admin APIs Used to Modify SSL Certificates.	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

An attacker who can reach the installation web interface can POST arbitrary `root_user` and `root_password` values, causing the script to replace the default admin credentials with attacker‑controlled ones. The script also contains hard‑coded SHA‑512 and SHA‑1 hashes of the default password, allowing the attacker to bypass password‑policy validation. As a result, an unauthenticated remote attacker can obtain full administrative control of the system during the initial setup. This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-022 — Insecure Installation Credentials.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

The `console_release` directory is reachable from the internet without any authentication.  Inside that directory are dozens of PHP scripts that build URLs from user‑controlled values and then invoke either 'curl_exec()` or `file_get_contents()` without proper validation. Although many files attempt to mitigate SSRF by calling `filter_var', the checks are incomplete. Because the endpoint is unauthenticated, any remote attacker can supply a hostname and cause the server to issue requests to internal resources. This enables internal network reconnaissance, potential pivoting, or data exfiltration. This vulnerability has been confirmed to be remediated, but it is unclear as to when the patch was introduced.	8.6	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

The '/var/www/app/console_release/hp/badgeSetup.php' script is reachable from the Internet without any authentication and builds URLs from user‑controlled parameters before invoking either the custom processCurl() function or PHP’s file_get_contents(); in both cases the hostname/URL is taken directly from the request with no whitelist, scheme restriction, IP‑range validation, or outbound‑network filtering. Consequently, any unauthenticated attacker can force the server to issue arbitrary HTTP requests to internal resources. This enables internal network reconnaissance, credential leakage, pivoting, and data exfiltration. This vulnerability has been confirmed to be remediated, but it is unclear as to when the patch was introduced.	8.6	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

An admin‑level attacker can therefore point the hostname to a malicious web server that issues a 301 redirect to internal endpoints such as the AWS EC2 metadata service. The server follows the redirect, retrieves the metadata, and returns or stores the credentials, enabling the attacker to steal cloud IAM keys, enumerate internal services, and pivot further into the SaaS infrastructure. This vulnerability has been confirmed to be remediated, but it is unclear as to when the patch was introduced.	6.8	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

The keys are stored in clear text under /var/www/app/config/ as keyfile.ppk.dev and keyfile.saasid.ppk.dev. The application uses these keys as the symmetric secret for AES‑256‑CBC encryption/decryption of the “SaaS Id” (external identifier) through the getEncryptedExternalId() / getDecryptedExternalId() methods. Because the secret is embedded in the deployed image, any attacker who can obtain a copy of the Docker image, read the configuration files, or otherwise enumerate the filesystem can recover the encryption key. This vulnerability has been confirmed to be remediated, but it is unclear as to when the patch was introduced.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVE-2025-59937	2025-09-29T23:15:31.807	2025-10-02T19:12:42.843	go-mail is a comprehensive library for sending mails with Go. In versions 0.7.0 and below, due to incorrect handling of the mail.Address values when a sender- or recipient address is passed to the corresponding MAIL FROM or RCPT TO commands of the SMTP client, there is a possibility of wrong address routing or even ESMTP parameter smuggling. For successful exploitation, it is required that the user's code allows for arbitrary mail address input (i. e. through a web form or similar). If only static mail addresses are used (i. e. in a config file) and the mail addresses in use do not consist of quoted local parts, this should not affect users. This issue is fixed in version 0.7.1

In versions 0.8.8 and below, go-f3's justification verification caching mechanism has a vulnerability where verification results are cached without properly considering the context of the message. An attacker can bypass justification verification by submitting a valid message with a correct justification and then reusing the same cached justification in contexts where it would normally be invalid. This occurs because the cached verification does not properly validate the relationship between the justification and the specific message context it's being used with. This issue is fixed in version 0.8.9.	5.9	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L

CVE-2025-9230	2025-09-30T14:15:41.050	2025-10-02T19:12:17.160	"Issue summary: An application trying to decrypt CMS messages encrypted using
password based encryption can trigger an out-of-bounds read and write.

Impact summary: This out-of-bounds read may trigger a crash which leads to
Denial of Service for an application. The out-of-bounds write can cause
a memory corruption which can have various consequences including
a Denial of Service or Execution of attacker-supplied code.

Although the consequences of a successful exploit of this vulnerability
could be severe, the probability that the attacker would be able to
perform it is low. Besides, password based (PWRI) encryption support in CMS
messages is very rarely used. For that reason the issue was assessed as
Moderate severity according to our Security Policy.

recovery of the private key exists in the SM2 algorithm implementation on 64 bit
ARM platforms.

Impact summary: A timing side-channel in SM2 signature computations on 64 bit
ARM platforms could allow recovering the private key by an attacker..

While remote key recovery over a network was not attempted by the reporter,
timing measurements revealed a timing signal which may allow such an attack.

OpenSSL does not directly support certificates with SM2 keys in TLS, and so
this CVE is not relevant in most TLS contexts.  However, given that it is
possible to add support for such certificates via a custom provider, coupled
with the fact that in such a custom provider context the private key may be
recoverable via remote timing measurements, we consider this to be a Moderate
severity issue.

The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this

trigger an out-of-bounds read if the 'no_proxy' environment variable is set and
the host portion of the authority component of the HTTP URL is an IPv6 address.

Impact summary: An out-of-bounds read can trigger a crash which leads to
Denial of Service for an application.

The OpenSSL HTTP client API functions can be used directly by applications
but they are also used by the OCSP client functions and CMP (Certificate
Management Protocol) client implementation in OpenSSL. However the URLs used
by these implementations are unlikely to be controlled by an attacker.

In this vulnerable code the out of bounds read can only trigger a crash.
Furthermore the vulnerability requires an attacker-controlled URL to be
passed from an application to the OpenSSL function and the user has to have
a 'no_proxy' environment variable set. For the aforementioned reasons the
issue was assessed as Low severity.

CVE-2025-56301	2025-09-30T15:15:52.040	2025-10-02T19:12:17.160	An issue was discovered in Chipsalliance Rocket-Chip commit f517abbf41abb65cea37421d3559f9739efd00a9 (2025-01-29) allowing attackers to corrupt exception handling and privilege state transitions via a flawed interaction between exception handling and MRET return mechanisms in the CSR logic when an exception is triggered during MRET execution. The Control and Status Register (CSR) logic has a flawed interaction between exception handling and exception return (MRET) mechanisms which can cause faulty trap behavior. When the MRET instruction is executed in machine mode without being in an exception state, an Instruction Access Fault may be triggered. This results in both the exception handling logic and the exception return logic activating simultaneously, leading to conflicting updates to the control and status registers.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

This issue stems from the /etc/passwd file being created with group-writable permissions during build time. In certain conditions, an attacker who can execute commands within an affected container, even as a non-root user, can leverage their membership in the root group to modify the /etc/passwd file. This could allow the attacker to add a new user with any arbitrary UID, including UID 0, leading to full root privileges within the container.	5.2	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L

CVE-2025-56132	2025-09-30T19:15:37.253	2025-10-02T19:12:17.160	LiquidFiles filetransfer server is vulnerable to a user enumeration issue in its password reset functionality. The application returns distinguishable responses for valid and invalid email addresses, allowing unauthenticated attackers to determine the existence of user accounts. Version 4.2 introduces user-based lockout mechanisms to mitigate brute-force attacks, user enumeration remains possible by default. In versions prior to 4.2, no such user-level protection is in place, only basic IP-based rate limiting is enforced. This IP-based protection can be bypassed by distributing requests across multiple IPs (e.g., rotating IP or proxies). Effectively bypassing both login and password reset security controls. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to enumerate valid email addresses registered for the application, increasing the risk of follow-up attacks such as password spraying.	7.3	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L
