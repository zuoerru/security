CVE-2025-4143	2025-05-01T01:15:54.127	2025-05-12T19:39:43.820	"The OAuth implementation in workers-oauth-provider that is part of  MCP framework https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-mcp , did not correctly validate that redirect_uri was on the allowed list of redirect URIs for the given client registration.

Fixed in:  https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/26 https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/26 

Impact:

 

Under certain circumstances (see below), if a victim had previously authorized with a server built on workers-oath-provider, and an attacker could later trick the victim into visiting a malicious web site, then attacker could potentially steal the victim's credentials to the same OAuth server and subsequently impersonate them.

In order for the attack to be possible, the OAuth server's authorized callback must be designed to auto-approve authorizations that appear to come from an OAuth client that the victim has authorized previously. The authorization flow is not implemented by workers-oauth-provider; it is up to the application built on top to decide whether to implement such automatic re-authorization. However, many applications do implement such logic.

Note: It is a basic, well-known requirement that OAuth servers should verify that the redirect URI is among the allowed list for the client, both during the authorization flow and subsequently when exchanging the authorization code for an access token. workers-oauth-provider implemented only the latter check, not the former. Unfortunately, the former is the much more important check. Readers who are familiar with OAuth may recognize that failing to check redirect URIs against the allowed list is a well-known, basic mistake, covered extensively in the RFC and elsewhere. The author of this library would like everyone to know that he was, in fact, well-aware of this requirement, thought about it a lot while designing the library, and then, somehow, forgot to actually make sure the check was in the code. That is, it's not that he didn't know what he was doing, it's that he knew what he was doing but flubbed it."	6.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

Impact: 

PKCE is a defense-in-depth mechanism against certain kinds of attacks and was an optional extension in OAuth 2.0 which became required in the OAuth 2.1 draft. (Note that the MCP specification requires OAuth 2.1.). This bug completely bypasses PKCE protection."	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

KVM: x86: Acquire SRCU in KVM_GET_MP_STATE to protect guest memory accesses

Acquire a lock on kvm->srcu when userspace is getting MP state to handle a
rather extreme edge case where ""accepting"" APIC events, i.e. processing
pending INIT or SIPI, can trigger accesses to guest memory.  If the vCPU
is in L2 with INIT *and* a TRIPLE_FAULT request pending, then getting MP
state will trigger a nested VM-Exit by way of ->check_nested_events(), and
emuating the nested VM-Exit can access guest memory.

The splat was originally hit by syzkaller on a Google-internal kernel, and
reproduced on an upstream kernel by hacking the triple_fault_event_test
selftest to stuff a pending INIT, store an MSR on VM-Exit (to generate a
memory access on VMX), and do vcpu_mp_state_get() to trigger the scenario.

CVE-2025-23142	2025-05-01T13:15:50.017	2025-05-02T13:53:20.943	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sctp: detect and prevent references to a freed transport in sendmsg

sctp_sendmsg() re-uses associations and transports when possible by
doing a lookup based on the socket endpoint and the message destination
address, and then sctp_sendmsg_to_asoc() sets the selected transport in
all the message chunks to be sent.

There's a possible race condition if another thread triggers the removal
of that selected transport, for instance, by explicitly unbinding an
address with setsockopt(SCTP_SOCKOPT_BINDX_REM), after the chunks have
been set up and before the message is sent. This can happen if the send
buffer is full, during the period when the sender thread temporarily
releases the socket lock in sctp_wait_for_sndbuf().

This causes the access to the transport data in
sctp_outq_select_transport(), when the association outqueue is flushed,
to result in a use-after-free read.

This change avoids this scenario by having sctp_transport_free() signal
the freeing of the transport, tagging it as ""dead"". In order to do this,
the patch restores the ""dead"" bit in struct sctp_transport, which was
removed in
commit 47faa1e4c50e (""sctp: remove the dead field of sctp_transport"").

Then, in the scenario where the sender thread has released the socket
lock in sctp_wait_for_sndbuf(), the bit is checked again after
re-acquiring the socket lock to detect the deletion. This is done while
holding a reference to the transport to prevent it from being freed in
the process.

If the transport was deleted while the socket lock was relinquished,
sctp_sendmsg_to_asoc() will return -EAGAIN to let userspace retry the
send.

The bug was found by a private syzbot instance (see the error report [1]
and the C reproducer that triggers it [2])."					
CVE-2025-23143	2025-05-01T13:15:50.127	2025-10-02T14:15:43.407	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: Fix null-ptr-deref by sock_lock_init_class_and_name() and rmmod.

When I ran the repro [0] and waited a few seconds, I observed two
LOCKDEP splats: a warning immediately followed by a null-ptr-deref. [1]

Reproduction Steps:

  1) Mount CIFS
  2) Add an iptables rule to drop incoming FIN packets for CIFS
  3) Unmount CIFS
  4) Unload the CIFS module
  5) Remove the iptables rule

At step 3), the CIFS module calls sock_release() for the underlying
TCP socket, and it returns quickly.  However, the socket remains in
FIN_WAIT_1 because incoming FIN packets are dropped.

At this point, the module's refcnt is 0 while the socket is still
alive, so the following rmmod command succeeds.

  # ss -tan
  State      Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address:Port  Peer Address:Port
  FIN-WAIT-1 0      477        10.0.2.15:51062   10.0.0.137:445

  # lsmod | grep cifs
  cifs                 1159168  0

This highlights a discrepancy between the lifetime of the CIFS module
and the underlying TCP socket.  Even after CIFS calls sock_release()
and it returns, the TCP socket does not die immediately in order to
close the connection gracefully.

While this is generally fine, it causes an issue with LOCKDEP because
CIFS assigns a different lock class to the TCP socket's sk->sk_lock
using sock_lock_init_class_and_name().

Once an incoming packet is processed for the socket or a timer fires,
sk->sk_lock is acquired.

Then, LOCKDEP checks the lock context in check_wait_context(), where
hlock_class() is called to retrieve the lock class.  However, since
the module has already been unloaded, hlock_class() logs a warning
and returns NULL, triggering the null-ptr-deref.

If LOCKDEP is enabled, we must ensure that a module calling
sock_lock_init_class_and_name() (CIFS, NFS, etc) cannot be unloaded
while such a socket is still alive to prevent this issue.

Let's hold the module reference in sock_lock_init_class_and_name()
and release it when the socket is freed in sk_prot_free().

Note that sock_lock_init() clears sk->sk_owner for svc_create_socket()
that calls sock_lock_init_class_and_name() for a listening socket,
which clones a socket by sk_clone_lock() without GFP_ZERO.

can be processed by the server on different CPUs concurrently). The
'subflow_req->msk' ownership is transferred to the subflow the first,
and there will be a risk of a null pointer dereference here.

This patch fixes this issue by moving the 'subflow_req->msk' under the

The I3C master driver may receive an IBI from a target device that has not

to queue an IBI work task, leading to ""Unable to handle kernel read from
unreadable memory"" and resulting in a kernel panic.

Typical IBI handling flow:
1. The I3C master scans target devices and probes their respective drivers.
2. The target device driver calls `i3c_device_request_ibi()` to enable IBI
   and assigns `dev->ibi = ibi`.
3. The I3C master receives an IBI from the target device and calls
   `i3c_master_queue_ibi()` to queue the target device driver’s IBI
   handler task.

However, since target device events are asynchronous to the I3C probe
sequence, step 3 may occur before step 2, causing `dev->ibi` to be `NULL`,

The following loop is located right above 'if' statement.

for (i = count-1; i >= 0; i--) {
	/* is more than half of this entry in 2nd half of the block? */
	if (size + map[i].size/2 > blocksize/2)
		break;
	size += map[i].size;
	move++;
}

'i' in this case could go down to -1, in which case sum of active entries
wouldn't exceed half the block size, but previous behaviour would also do
split in half if sum would exceed at the very last block, which in case of
having too many long name files in a single block could lead to
out-of-bounds access and following use-after-free.

CVE-2025-23151	2025-05-01T13:15:51.003	2025-05-02T13:53:20.943	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bus: mhi: host: Fix race between unprepare and queue_buf

A client driver may use mhi_unprepare_from_transfer() to quiesce
incoming data during the client driver's tear down. The client driver
might also be processing data at the same time, resulting in a call to
mhi_queue_buf() which will invoke mhi_gen_tre(). If mhi_gen_tre() runs
after mhi_unprepare_from_transfer() has torn down the channel, a panic
will occur due to an invalid dereference leading to a page fault.

This occurs because mhi_gen_tre() does not verify the channel state
after locking it. Fix this by having mhi_gen_tre() confirm the channel
state is valid, or return error to avoid accessing deinitialized data.

Device setup:

     netdevsim0 (down)
     ^        ^
  bond        netdevsim1.100@netdevsim1 allmulticast=on (down)

When we enslave the lower device (netdevsim0) which has a vlan, we
propagate vlan's allmuti/promisc flags during ndo_open. This causes
(re)locking on of the real_dev.

Propagate allmulti/promisc on flags change, not on the open. There
is a slight semantics change that vlans that are down now propagate
the flags, but this seems unlikely to result in the real issues.

Reproducer:

  echo 0 1 > /sys/bus/netdevsim/new_device

  dev_path=$(ls -d /sys/bus/netdevsim/devices/netdevsim0/net/*)
  dev=$(echo $dev_path | rev | cut -d/ -f1 | rev)

= -924 (decimal, long long)

In f2fs_truncate_inode_blocks(), UBSAN detects that get_nid() tries to
access .i_nid[-924], it means both offset[0] and level should zero.

The possible case should be in f2fs_do_truncate_blocks(), we try to
truncate inode size to zero, however, dn.ofs_in_node is zero and
dn.node_page is not an inode page, so it fails to truncate inode page,
and then pass zeroed free_from to f2fs_truncate_inode_blocks(), result
in this issue.

	if (dn.ofs_in_node || IS_INODE(dn.node_page)) {
		f2fs_truncate_data_blocks_range(&dn, count);
		free_from += count;
	}

I guess the reason why dn.node_page is not an inode page could be: there
are multiple nat entries share the same node block address, once the node
block address was reused, f2fs_get_node_page() may load a non-inode block.

Let's add a sanity check for such condition to avoid out-of-bounds access

jfs: Prevent copying of nlink with value 0 from disk inode

syzbot report a deadlock in diFree. [1]

When calling ""ioctl$LOOP_SET_STATUS64"", the offset value passed in is 4,
which does not match the mounted loop device, causing the mapping of the
mounted loop device to be invalidated.

When creating the directory and creating the inode of iag in diReadSpecial(),
read the page of fixed disk inode (AIT) in raw mode in read_metapage(), the
metapage data it returns is corrupted, which causes the nlink value of 0 to be
assigned to the iag inode when executing copy_from_dinode(), which ultimately
causes a deadlock when entering diFree().

To avoid this, first check the nlink value of dinode before setting iag inode.

CVE-2025-37743	2025-05-01T13:15:53.000	2025-05-02T13:53:20.943	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: Avoid memory leak while enabling statistics

Driver uses monitor destination rings for extended statistics mode and
standalone monitor mode. In extended statistics mode, TLVs are parsed from
the buffer received from the monitor destination ring and assigned to the
ppdu_info structure to update per-packet statistics. In standalone monitor
mode, along with per-packet statistics, the packet data (payload) is
captured, and the driver updates per MSDU to mac80211.

When the AP interface is enabled, only extended statistics mode is
activated. As part of enabling monitor rings for collecting statistics,
the driver subscribes to HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV in the filter
configuration. This TLV is received from the monitor destination ring, and
kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object occurs, which is not freed, leading to a
memory leak. The kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object is only required while
enabling the standalone monitor interface. This causes a memory leak while
enabling extended statistics mode in the driver.

Fix this memory leak by removing the kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object in
the HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV handling. Additionally, remove the standalone
monitor mode handlings in the HAL_MON_BUF_ADDR and HAL_RX_MSDU_END TLVs.
These TLV tags will be handled properly when enabling standalone monitor
mode in the future.

PM: hibernate: Avoid deadlock in hibernate_compressor_param_set()

syzbot reported a deadlock in lock_system_sleep() (see below).

The write operation to ""/sys/module/hibernate/parameters/compressor""
conflicts with the registration of ieee80211 device, resulting in a deadlock
when attempting to acquire system_transition_mutex under param_lock.

To avoid this deadlock, change hibernate_compressor_param_set() to use
mutex_trylock() for attempting to acquire system_transition_mutex and
return -EBUSY when it fails.

Task flags need not be saved or adjusted before calling
mutex_trylock(&system_transition_mutex) because the caller is not going
to end up waiting for this mutex and if it runs concurrently with system
suspend in progress, it will be frozen properly when it returns to user
space.

perf: Fix hang while freeing sigtrap event

Perf can hang while freeing a sigtrap event if a related deferred
signal hadn't managed to be sent before the file got closed:

perf_event_overflow()
   task_work_add(perf_pending_task)

fput()
   task_work_add(____fput())

task_work_run()

                        rcuwait_wait_event()

Once task_work_run() is running, the list of pending callbacks is
removed from the task_struct and from this point on task_work_cancel()
can't remove any pending and not yet started work items, hence the
task_work_cancel() failure and the hang on rcuwait_wait_event().

Task work could be changed to remove one work at a time, so a work
running on the current task can always cancel a pending one, however
the wait / wake design is still subject to inverted dependencies when
remote targets are involved, as pictured by Oleg:

T1                                                      T2

fd = perf_event_open(pid => T2->pid);                  fd = perf_event_open(pid => T1->pid);

Therefore the only option left is to acquire the event reference count
upon queueing the perf task work and release it from the task work, just
like it was done before 3a5465418f5f (""perf: Fix event leak upon exec and file release"")
but without the leaks it fixed.

Some adjustments are necessary to make it work:

* A child event might dereference its parent upon freeing. Care must be
  taken to release the parent last.

* Some places assuming the event doesn't have any reference held and
  therefore can be freed right away must instead put the reference and
  let the reference counting to its job."

is enabled we'd need to wait for all packets to be _acked_.
Disconnect is not commonly used, disallow it.

The immediate problem syzbot run into is the warning in the strp,
but that's just the easiest bug to trigger:

mm/vma: add give_up_on_oom option on modify/merge, use in uffd release

Currently, if a VMA merge fails due to an OOM condition arising on commit
merge or a failure to duplicate anon_vma's, we report this so the caller
can handle it.

However there are cases where the caller is only ostensibly trying a
merge, and doesn't mind if it fails due to this condition.

Since we do not want to introduce an implicit assumption that we only
actually modify VMAs after OOM conditions might arise, add a 'give up on
oom' option and make an explicit contract that, should this flag be set, we
absolutely will not modify any VMAs should OOM arise and just bail out.

Since it'd be very unusual for a user to try to vma_modify() with this flag
set but be specifying a range within a VMA which ends up being split (which
can fail due to rlimit issues, not only OOM), we add a debug warning for
this condition.

The motivating reason for this is uffd release - syzkaller (and Pedro
Falcato's VERY astute analysis) found a way in which an injected fault on
allocation, triggering an OOM condition on commit merge, would result in
uffd code becoming confused and treating an error value as if it were a VMA
pointer.

To avoid this, we make use of this new VMG flag to ensure that this never
occurs, utilising the fact that, should we be clearing entire VMAs, we do
not wish an OOM event to be reported to us.

Many thanks to Pedro Falcato for his excellent analysis and Jann Horn for
his insightful and intelligent analysis of the situation, both of whom were
instrumental in this fix."

The cause of this is:

- drm_prime_gem_destroy calls dma_buf_put(dma_buf) which releases the
  reference to the shared dma_buf. The reference count is 0, so the
  dma_buf is destroyed, which in turn decrements the corresponding
  amdgpu_bo reference count to 0, and the amdgpu_bo is destroyed -
  calling drm_gem_object_release then dma_resv_fini (which destroys the
  reservation object), then finally freeing the amdgpu_bo.

- nouveau_bo obj->bo.base.resv is now a dangling pointer to the memory
  formerly allocated to the amdgpu_bo.

- nouveau_gem_object_del calls ttm_bo_put(&nvbo->bo) which calls
  ttm_bo_release, which schedules ttm_bo_delayed_delete.

- ttm_bo_delayed_delete runs and dereferences the dangling resv pointer,
  resulting in a general protection fault.

Fix this by moving the drm_prime_gem_destroy call from
nouveau_gem_object_del to nouveau_bo_del_ttm. This ensures that it will
be run after ttm_bo_delayed_delete."

RDMA/cma: Fix workqueue crash in cma_netevent_work_handler

struct rdma_cm_id has member ""struct work_struct net_work""
that is reused for enqueuing cma_netevent_work_handler()s
onto cma_wq.

Below crash[1] can occur if more than one call to
cma_netevent_callback() occurs in quick succession,
which further enqueues cma_netevent_work_handler()s for the
same rdma_cm_id, overwriting any previously queued work-item(s)
that was just scheduled to run i.e. there is no guarantee
the queued work item may run between two successive calls
to cma_netevent_callback() and the 2nd INIT_WORK would overwrite
the 1st work item (for the same rdma_cm_id), despite grabbing
id_table_lock during enqueue.

Also drgn analysis [2] indicates the work item was likely overwritten.

Fix this by moving the INIT_WORK() to __rdma_create_id(),
so that it doesn't race with any existing queue_work() or
its worker thread.

}

Suspicion is that pwq is NULL:
>>> trace[8][""pwq""]
(struct pool_workqueue *)<absent>

In process_one_work(), pwq is assigned from:
struct pool_workqueue *pwq = get_work_pwq(work);

and get_work_pwq() is:
static struct pool_workqueue *get_work_pwq(struct work_struct *work)
{
 	unsigned long data = atomic_long_read(&work->data);

 	if (data & WORK_STRUCT_PWQ)
 		return work_struct_pwq(data);
 	else
 		return NULL;
}

WORK_STRUCT_PWQ is 0x4:
>>> print(repr(prog['WORK_STRUCT_PWQ']))
Object(prog, 'enum work_flags', value=4)

But work->data is 536870912 which is 0x20000000.
So, get_work_pwq() returns NULL and we crash in process_one_work():
3168	strscpy(worker->desc, pwq->wq->name, WORKER_DESC_LEN);

The handle_bytes value passed in by the reproducing program is equal to 12.
In handle_to_path(), only 12 bytes of memory are allocated for the structure
file_handle->f_handle member, which causes an out-of-bounds access when
accessing the member parent_block of the structure isofs_fid in isofs,

i2c: cros-ec-tunnel: defer probe if parent EC is not present

When i2c-cros-ec-tunnel and the EC driver are built-in, the EC parent
device will not be found, leading to NULL pointer dereference.

That can also be reproduced by unbinding the controller driver and then
loading i2c-cros-ec-tunnel module (or binding the device).

drm/msm/dpu: Fix error pointers in dpu_plane_virtual_atomic_check

The function dpu_plane_virtual_atomic_check was dereferencing pointers
returned by drm_atomic_get_plane_state without checking for errors. This
could lead to undefined behavior if the function returns an error pointer.

This commit adds checks using IS_ERR to ensure that plane_state is
valid before dereferencing them.

Similar to commit da29abe71e16

The ICSS IEP driver tracks perout and pps enable state with flags.
Currently when disabling pps and perout signals during icss_iep_exit(),
results in NULL pointer dereference for perout.

To fix the null pointer dereference issue, the icss_iep_perout_enable_hw

disabling PPS or PEROUT, without referencing the ptp_perout_request

net: dsa: free routing table on probe failure

If complete = true in dsa_tree_setup(), it means that we are the last
switch of the tree which is successfully probing, and we should be
setting up all switches from our probe path.

After ""complete"" becomes true, dsa_tree_setup_cpu_ports() or any
subsequent function may fail. If that happens, the entire tree setup is
in limbo: the first N-1 switches have successfully finished probing
(doing nothing but having allocated persistent memory in the tree's
dst->ports, and maybe dst->rtable), and switch N failed to probe, ending
the tree setup process before anything is tangible from the user's PoV.

If switch N fails to probe, its memory (ports) will be freed and removed
from dst->ports. However, the dst->rtable elements pointing to its ports,
as created by dsa_link_touch(), will remain there, and will lead to
use-after-free if dereferenced.

If dsa_tree_setup_switches() returns -EPROBE_DEFER, which is entirely
possible because that is where ds->ops->setup() is, we get a kasan
report like this:

The simplest way to fix the bug is to delete the routing table in its
entirety. dsa_tree_setup_routing_table() has no problem in regenerating
it even if we deleted links between ports other than those of switch N,
because dsa_link_touch() first checks whether the port pair already
exists in dst->rtable, allocating if not.

The deletion of the routing table in its entirety already exists in
dsa_tree_teardown(), so refactor that into a function that can also be
called from the tree setup error path.

In my analysis of the commit to blame, it is the one which added
dsa_link elements to dst->rtable. Prior to that, each switch had its own
ds->rtable which is freed when the switch fails to probe. But the tree
is potentially persistent memory."

net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: avoid unregistering devlink regions which were never registered

Russell King reports that a system with mv88e6xxx dereferences a NULL
pointer when unbinding this driver:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/Z_lRkMlTJ1KQ0kVX@shell.armlinux.org.uk/

The crash seems to be in devlink_region_destroy(), which is not NULL
tolerant but is given a NULL devlink global region pointer.

At least on some chips, some devlink regions are conditionally registered
since the blamed commit, see mv88e6xxx_setup_devlink_regions_global():

		if (cond && !cond(chip))
			continue;

These are MV88E6XXX_REGION_STU and MV88E6XXX_REGION_PVT. If the chip
does not have an STU or PVT, it should crash like this.

To fix the issue, avoid unregistering those regions which are NULL, i.e.
were skipped at mv88e6xxx_setup_devlink_regions_global() time."

Indeed another concurrent vif schedule_and_wake_txq call could cause

mft record loading from disk is within bounds.

Patch 2 moves the ATTR_RECORD's bounds checking earlier, to avoid
dereferencing ATTR_RECORD before checking this ATTR_RECORD is within

Kernel will loads $MFT/$DATA's first mft record in
ntfs_read_inode_mount().

Yet the problem is that after loading, kernel doesn't check whether
attrs_offset field is a valid value.

To be more specific, if attrs_offset field is larger than bytes_allocated
field, then it may trigger the out-of-bounds read bug(reported as
use-after-free bug) in ntfs_attr_find(), when kernel tries to access the
corresponding mft record's attribute.

This patch solves it by adding the sanity check between attrs_offset field
and bytes_allocated field, after loading the first mft record."

bpf: Prevent bpf program recursion for raw tracepoint probes

The can be reproduced by attaching bpf program as raw tracepoint on
contention_begin tracepoint. The bpf prog calls bpf_trace_printk
helper. Then by running perf bench the spin lock code is forced to
take slow path and call contention_begin tracepoint.

Fixing this by skipping execution of the bpf program if it's
already running, Using bpf prog 'active' field, which is being
currently used by trampoline programs for the same reason.

Moving bpf_prog_inc_misses_counter to syscall.c because
trampoline.c is compiled in just for CONFIG_BPF_JIT option.

9p/trans_fd: always use O_NONBLOCK read/write

syzbot is reporting hung task at p9_fd_close() [1], for p9_mux_poll_stop()
 from p9_conn_destroy() from p9_fd_close() is failing to interrupt already
started kernel_read() from p9_fd_read() from p9_read_work() and/or
kernel_write() from p9_fd_write() from p9_write_work() requests.

Since p9_socket_open() sets O_NONBLOCK flag, p9_mux_poll_stop() does not
need to interrupt kernel_read()/kernel_write(). However, since p9_fd_open()
does not set O_NONBLOCK flag, but pipe blocks unless signal is pending,
p9_mux_poll_stop() needs to interrupt kernel_read()/kernel_write() when
the file descriptor refers to a pipe. In other words, pipe file descriptor
needs to be handled as if socket file descriptor.

We somehow need to interrupt kernel_read()/kernel_write() on pipes.

A minimal change, which this patch is doing, is to set O_NONBLOCK flag
 from p9_fd_open(), for O_NONBLOCK flag does not affect reading/writing
of regular files. But this approach changes O_NONBLOCK flag on userspace-
supplied file descriptors (which might break userspace programs), and
O_NONBLOCK flag could be changed by userspace. It would be possible to set
O_NONBLOCK flag every time p9_fd_read()/p9_fd_write() is invoked, but still
remains small race window for clearing O_NONBLOCK flag.

If we don't want to manipulate O_NONBLOCK flag, we might be able to
surround kernel_read()/kernel_write() with set_thread_flag(TIF_SIGPENDING)
and recalc_sigpending(). Since p9_read_work()/p9_write_work() works are
processed by kernel threads which process global system_wq workqueue,
signals could not be delivered from remote threads when p9_mux_poll_stop()
 from p9_conn_destroy() from p9_fd_close() is called. Therefore, calling
set_thread_flag(TIF_SIGPENDING)/recalc_sigpending() every time would be
needed if we count on signals for making kernel_read()/kernel_write()
non-blocking.

bad calculations. It's always a fixed value based on the block size so

dm ioctl: fix misbehavior if list_versions races with module loading

__list_versions will first estimate the required space using the
""dm_target_iterate(list_version_get_needed, &needed)"" call and then will
fill the space using the ""dm_target_iterate(list_version_get_info,
&iter_info)"" call. Each of these calls locks the targets using the
""down_read(&_lock)"" and ""up_read(&_lock)"" calls, however between the first
and second ""dm_target_iterate"" there is no lock held and the target
modules can be loaded at this point, so the second ""dm_target_iterate""
call may need more space than what was the first ""dm_target_iterate""
returned.

The code tries to handle this overflow (see the beginning of
list_version_get_info), however this handling is incorrect.

The code sets ""param->data_size = param->data_start + needed"" and
""iter_info.end = (char *)vers+len"" - ""needed"" is the size returned by the
first dm_target_iterate call; ""len"" is the size of the buffer allocated by
userspace.

""len"" may be greater than ""needed""; in this case, the code will write up
to ""len"" bytes into the buffer, however param->data_size is set to
""needed"", so it may write data past the param->data_size value. The ioctl
interface copies only up to param->data_size into userspace, thus part of
the result will be truncated.

Fix this bug by setting ""iter_info.end = (char *)vers + needed;"" - this
guarantees that the second ""dm_target_iterate"" call will write only up to
the ""needed"" buffer and it will exit with ""DM_BUFFER_FULL_FLAG"" if it
overflows the ""needed"" space - in this case, userspace will allocate a
larger buffer and retry.

Note that there is also a bug in list_version_get_needed - we need to add
""strlen(tt->name) + 1"" to the needed size, not ""strlen(tt->name)""."

perf: Improve missing SIGTRAP checking

To catch missing SIGTRAP we employ a WARN in __perf_event_overflow(),
which fires if pending_sigtrap was already set: returning to user space
without consuming pending_sigtrap, and then having the event fire again
would re-enter the kernel and trigger the WARN.

This, however, seemed to miss the case where some events not associated
with progress in the user space task can fire and the interrupt handler
runs before the IRQ work meant to consume pending_sigtrap (and generate
the SIGTRAP).

syzbot gifted us this stack trace:

In this case, syzbot produced a program with event type
PERF_TYPE_SOFTWARE and config PERF_COUNT_SW_CPU_CLOCK. The hrtimer
manages to fire again before the IRQ work got a chance to run, all while
never having returned to user space.

Improve the WARN to check for real progress in user space: approximate
this by storing a 32-bit hash of the current IP into pending_sigtrap,
and if an event fires while pending_sigtrap still matches the previous
IP, we assume no progress (false negatives are possible given we could
return to user space and trigger again on the same IP)."

Mike says:

  The splat comes from fpu_inherit_perms() being called under fpregs_lock(),
  and us reaching the spin_lock_irq() therein due to fpu_state_size_dynamic()
  returning true despite static key __fpu_state_size_dynamic having never
  been enabled.

Mike's assessment looks correct. fpregs_lock on a PREEMPT_RT kernel disables
preemption so calling spin_lock_irq() in fpu_inherit_perms() is unsafe. This
problem exists since commit

  9e798e9aa14c (""x86/fpu: Prepare fpu_clone() for dynamically enabled features"").

Even though the original bug report should not have enabled the paths at
all, the bug still exists.

fpregs_lock is necessary when editing the FPU registers or a task's FP
state but it is not necessary for fpu_inherit_perms(). The only write
of any FP state in fpu_inherit_perms() is for the new child which is
not running yet and cannot context switch or be borrowed by a kernel
thread yet. Hence, fpregs_lock is not protecting anything in the new
child until clone() completes and can be dropped earlier. The siglock
still needs to be acquired by fpu_inherit_perms() as the read of the
parent's permissions has to be serialised.

which may carry uninitialized data to the userspace, as observed by
KMSAN:

CVE-2022-49789	2025-05-01T15:16:02.143	2025-05-02T13:53:20.943	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: zfcp: Fix double free of FSF request when qdio send fails

We used to use the wrong type of integer in 'zfcp_fsf_req_send()' to cache
the FSF request ID when sending a new FSF request. This is used in case the
sending fails and we need to remove the request from our internal hash
table again (so we don't keep an invalid reference and use it when we free
the request again).

In 'zfcp_fsf_req_send()' we used to cache the ID as 'int' (signed and 32
bit wide), but the rest of the zfcp code (and the firmware specification)
handles the ID as 'unsigned long'/'u64' (unsigned and 64 bit wide [s390x
ELF ABI]).  For one this has the obvious problem that when the ID grows
past 32 bit (this can happen reasonably fast) it is truncated to 32 bit
when storing it in the cache variable and so doesn't match the original ID
anymore.  The second less obvious problem is that even when the original ID
has not yet grown past 32 bit, as soon as the 32nd bit is set in the
original ID (0x80000000 = 2'147'483'648) we will have a mismatch when we
cast it back to 'unsigned long'. As the cached variable is of a signed
type, the compiler will choose a sign-extending instruction to load the 32
bit variable into a 64 bit register (e.g.: 'lgf %r11,188(%r15)'). So once
we pass the cached variable into 'zfcp_reqlist_find_rm()' to remove the
request again all the leading zeros will be flipped to ones to extend the
sign and won't match the original ID anymore (this has been observed in
practice).

If we can't successfully remove the request from the hash table again after
'zfcp_qdio_send()' fails (this happens regularly when zfcp cannot notify
the adapter about new work because the adapter is already gone during
e.g. a ChpID toggle) we will end up with a double free.  We unconditionally
free the request in the calling function when 'zfcp_fsf_req_send()' fails,
but because the request is still in the hash table we end up with a stale
memory reference, and once the zfcp adapter is either reset during recovery
or shutdown we end up freeing the same memory twice.

The resulting stack traces vary depending on the kernel and have no direct
correlation to the place where the bug occurs. Here are three examples that
have been seen in practice:

  list_del corruption. next->prev should be 00000001b9d13800, but was 00000000dead4ead. (next=00000001bd131a00)

net: dsa: don't leak tagger-owned storage on switch driver unbind

In the initial commit dc452a471dba (""net: dsa: introduce tagger-owned
storage for private and shared data""), we had a call to
tag_ops->disconnect(dst) issued from dsa_tree_free(), which is called at
tree teardown time.

There were problems with connecting to a switch tree as a whole, so this
got reworked to connecting to individual switches within the tree. In
this process, tag_ops->disconnect(ds) was made to be called only from
switch.c (cross-chip notifiers emitted as a result of dynamic tag proto
changes), but the normal driver teardown code path wasn't replaced with
anything.

Solve this problem by adding a function that does the opposite of
dsa_switch_setup_tag_protocol(), which is called from the equivalent
spot in dsa_switch_teardown(). The positioning here also ensures that we
won't have any use-after-free in tagging protocol (*rcv) ops, since the
teardown sequence is as follows:

dsa_tree_teardown
-> dsa_tree_teardown_master
   -> dsa_master_teardown
      -> unsets master->dsa_ptr, making no further packets match the
         ETH_P_XDSA packet type handler
-> dsa_tree_teardown_ports
   -> dsa_port_teardown
      -> dsa_slave_destroy
         -> unregisters DSA net devices, there is even a synchronize_net()
            in unregister_netdevice_many()
-> dsa_tree_teardown_switches
   -> dsa_switch_teardown
      -> dsa_switch_teardown_tag_protocol
         -> finally frees the tagger-owned storage"

netfs: Fix missing xas_retry() calls in xarray iteration

netfslib has a number of places in which it performs iteration of an xarray
whilst being under the RCU read lock.  It *should* call xas_retry() as the
first thing inside of the loop and do ""continue"" if it returns true in case
the xarray walker passed out a special value indicating that the walk needs
to be redone from the root[*].

Fix this by adding the missing retry checks.

[*] I wonder if this should be done inside xas_find(), xas_next_node() and
    suchlike, but I'm told that's not an simple change to effect.

This can cause an oops like that below.  Note the faulting address - this
is an internal value (|0x2) returned from xarray.

bridge: switchdev: Fix memory leaks when changing VLAN protocol

The bridge driver can offload VLANs to the underlying hardware either
via switchdev or the 8021q driver. When the former is used, the VLAN is
marked in the bridge driver with the 'BR_VLFLAG_ADDED_BY_SWITCHDEV'
private flag.

To avoid the memory leaks mentioned in the cited commit, the bridge
driver will try to delete a VLAN via the 8021q driver if the VLAN is not
marked with the previously mentioned flag.

When the VLAN protocol of the bridge changes, switchdev drivers are
notified via the 'SWITCHDEV_ATTR_ID_BRIDGE_VLAN_PROTOCOL' attribute, but
the 8021q driver is also called to add the existing VLANs with the new
protocol and delete them with the old protocol.

In case the VLANs were offloaded via switchdev, the above behavior is
both redundant and buggy. Redundant because the VLANs are already
programmed in hardware and drivers that support VLAN protocol change
(currently only mlx5) change the protocol upon the switchdev attribute
notification. Buggy because the 8021q driver is called despite these
VLANs being marked with 'BR_VLFLAG_ADDED_BY_SWITCHDEV'. This leads to
memory leaks [1] when the VLANs are deleted.

Fix by not calling the 8021q driver for VLANs that were already
programmed via switchdev.

CVE-2022-49814	2025-05-01T15:16:04.787	2025-05-02T13:53:20.943	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

kcm: close race conditions on sk_receive_queue

sk->sk_receive_queue is protected by skb queue lock, but for KCM
sockets its RX path takes mux->rx_lock to protect more than just
skb queue. However, kcm_recvmsg() still only grabs the skb queue
lock, so race conditions still exist.

We can teach kcm_recvmsg() to grab mux->rx_lock too but this would
introduce a potential performance regression as struct kcm_mux can
be shared by multiple KCM sockets.

So we have to enforce skb queue lock in requeue_rx_msgs() and handle
skb peek case carefully in kcm_wait_data(). Fortunately,
skb_recv_datagram() already handles it nicely and is widely used by
other sockets, we can just switch to skb_recv_datagram() after
getting rid of the unnecessary sock lock in kcm_recvmsg() and
kcm_splice_read(). Side note: SOCK_DONE is not used by KCM sockets,
so it is safe to get rid of this check too.

I ran the original syzbot reproducer for 30 min without seeing any
issue."

hugetlbfs: don't delete error page from pagecache

This change is very similar to the change that was made for shmem [1], and
it solves the same problem but for HugeTLBFS instead.

Currently, when poison is found in a HugeTLB page, the page is removed
from the page cache.  That means that attempting to map or read that
hugepage in the future will result in a new hugepage being allocated
instead of notifying the user that the page was poisoned.  As [1] states,
this is effectively memory corruption.

The fix is to leave the page in the page cache.  If the user attempts to
use a poisoned HugeTLB page with a syscall, the syscall will fail with
EIO, the same error code that shmem uses.  For attempts to map the page,
the thread will get a BUS_MCEERR_AR SIGBUS.

While Task1 is sleeping, nilfs->ns_writer is freed by Task2.  After Task1
waked up, Task1 accesses nilfs->ns_writer which is already freed.  This
scenario diagram is based on the Shigeru Yoshida's post [1].

This patch fixes the issue by not detaching nilfs->ns_writer on remount so
that this UAF race doesn't happen.  Along with this change, this patch
also inserts a few necessary read-only checks with superblock instance
where only the ns_writer pointer was used to check if the filesystem is

The root case here is: In function prepare_func_exit(), the callee is
not released in the abnormal scenario after ""state->curframe--;"". To
fix, move ""state->curframe--;"" to the very bottom of the function,
right when we free callee and reset frame[] pointer to NULL, as Andrii
suggested.

In addition, function __check_func_call() has a similar problem. In
the abnormal scenario before ""state->curframe++;"", the callee also
should be released by free_func_state()."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

However, in sctp_prsctp_prune_unsent() as it is not a proper dequeue,
sctp_sched_dequeue_done() is not called to do this.

On hibernating, pm core calls into related hooks in sequence like:

    .freeze
    .freeze_noirq
    .thaw_noirq
    .thaw

With .thaw_noirq hook being absent, the clock will be disabled in a
unbalanced call which results the warning above.

    imx_uart_freeze()
        clk_prepare_enable()
    imx_uart_suspend_noirq()
        clk_disable()
    imx_uart_thaw
        clk_disable_unprepare()

Adding the missing .thaw_noirq hook as imx_uart_resume_noirq() will have
the call sequence corrected as below and thus fix the warning.

nilfs2: fix deadlock in nilfs_count_free_blocks()

A semaphore deadlock can occur if nilfs_get_block() detects metadata
corruption while locating data blocks and a superblock writeback occurs at
the same time:

task 1                               task 2
------                               ------

          nilfs_set_error()
            down_write(rwsem B) <--

                           *** DEADLOCK ***

Here, nilfs_get_block() readlocks rwsem A (= NILFS_MDT(dat_inode)->mi_sem)
and then calls nilfs_bmap_lookup_contig(), but if it fails due to metadata
corruption, __nilfs_error() is called from nilfs_bmap_convert_error()
inside the lock section.

Since __nilfs_error() calls nilfs_set_error() unless the filesystem is
read-only and nilfs_set_error() attempts to writelock rwsem B (=
nilfs->ns_sem) to write back superblock exclusively, hierarchical lock
acquisition occurs in the order rwsem A -> rwsem B.

Now, if another task starts updating the superblock, it may writelock
rwsem B during the lock sequence above, and can deadlock trying to
readlock rwsem A in nilfs_count_free_blocks().

However, there is actually no need to take rwsem A in
nilfs_count_free_blocks() because it, within the lock section, only reads
a single integer data on a shared struct with
nilfs_sufile_get_ncleansegs().  This has been the case after commit
aa474a220180 (""nilfs2: add local variable to cache the number of clean
segments""), that is, even before this bug was introduced.

So, this resolves the deadlock problem by just not taking the semaphore in
nilfs_count_free_blocks()."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

early_init_fdt_scan_reserved_mem() takes no arguments as it operates on
initial_boot_params, which is populated by early_init_dt_verify(). On
RISC-V, early_init_dt_verify() is called twice. Once, directly, in
setup_arch() if CONFIG_BUILTIN_DTB is not enabled and once indirectly,
very early in the boot process, by parse_dtb() when it calls
early_init_dt_scan_nodes().

This first call uses dtb_early_va to set initial_boot_params, which is
not usable later in the boot process when
early_init_fdt_scan_reserved_mem() is called. On arm64 for example, the
corresponding call to early_init_dt_scan_nodes() uses fixmap addresses
and doesn't suffer the same fate.

Move early_init_fdt_scan_reserved_mem() further along the boot sequence,
after the direct call to early_init_dt_verify() in setup_arch() so that
the names use the correct virtual memory addresses. The above supposed
that CONFIG_BUILTIN_DTB was not set, but should work equally in the case
where it is - unflatted_and_copy_device_tree() also updates
initial_boot_params."

sizeof(..) to int to work when TLV_GET_DATA_LEN() returns a negative

net: gso: fix panic on frag_list with mixed head alloc types

Since commit 3dcbdb134f32 (""net: gso: Fix skb_segment splat when
splitting gso_size mangled skb having linear-headed frag_list""), it is
allowed to change gso_size of a GRO packet. However, that commit assumes
that ""checking the first list_skb member suffices; i.e if either of the
list_skb members have non head_frag head, then the first one has too"".

It turns out this assumption does not hold. We've seen BUG_ON being hit
in skb_segment when skbs on the frag_list had differing head_frag with
the vmxnet3 driver. This happens because __netdev_alloc_skb and
__napi_alloc_skb can return a skb that is page backed or kmalloced
depending on the requested size. As the result, the last small skb in
the GRO packet can be kmalloced.

There are three different locations where this can be fixed:

(1) We could check head_frag in GRO and not allow GROing skbs with
    different head_frag. However, that would lead to performance
    regression on normal forward paths with unmodified gso_size, where
    !head_frag in the last packet is not a problem.

(2) Set a flag in bpf_skb_net_grow and bpf_skb_net_shrink indicating
    that NETIF_F_SG is undesirable. That would need to eat a bit in
    sk_buff. Furthermore, that flag can be unset when all skbs on the
    frag_list are page backed. To retain good performance,
    bpf_skb_net_grow/shrink would have to walk the frag_list.

(3) Walk the frag_list in skb_segment when determining whether
    NETIF_F_SG should be cleared. This of course slows things down.

This patch implements (3). To limit the performance impact in
skb_segment, the list is walked only for skbs with SKB_GSO_DODGY set
that have gso_size changed. Normal paths thus will not hit it.

We could check only the last skb but since we need to walk the whole
list anyway, let's stay on the safe side."

KVM: Reject attempts to consume or refresh inactive gfn_to_pfn_cache

Reject kvm_gpc_check() and kvm_gpc_refresh() if the cache is inactive.
Not checking the active flag during refresh is particularly egregious, as
KVM can end up with a valid, inactive cache, which can lead to a variety
of use-after-free bugs, e.g. consuming a NULL kernel pointer or missing
an mmu_notifier invalidation due to the cache not being on the list of
gfns to invalidate.

Note, ""active"" needs to be set if and only if the cache is on the list
of caches, i.e. is reachable via mmu_notifier events.  If a relevant
mmu_notifier event occurs while the cache is ""active"" but not on the
list, KVM will not acquire the cache's lock and so will not serailize
the mmu_notifier event with active users and/or kvm_gpc_refresh().

A race between KVM_XEN_ATTR_TYPE_SHARED_INFO and KVM_XEN_HVM_EVTCHN_SEND
can be exploited to trigger the bug.

1. Deactivate shinfo cache:

kvm_xen_hvm_set_attr
case KVM_XEN_ATTR_TYPE_SHARED_INFO
 kvm_gpc_deactivate
  kvm_gpc_unmap
   gpc->valid = false
   gpc->khva = NULL
  gpc->active = false

Result: active = false, valid = false

2. Cause cache refresh:

kvm_arch_vm_ioctl
case KVM_XEN_HVM_EVTCHN_SEND
 kvm_xen_hvm_evtchn_send
  kvm_xen_set_evtchn
   kvm_xen_set_evtchn_fast
    kvm_gpc_check
    return -EWOULDBLOCK because !gpc->valid
   kvm_xen_set_evtchn_fast
    return -EWOULDBLOCK
   kvm_gpc_refresh
    hva_to_pfn_retry
     gpc->valid = true
     gpc->khva = not NULL

Result: active = false, valid = true

3. Race ioctl KVM_XEN_HVM_EVTCHN_SEND against ioctl

But, it's not as bad as it sounds.  TDX can be configured to never
deliver these exceptions on private memory with a ""TD attribute""
called ATTR_SEPT_VE_DISABLE.  The guest has no way to *set* this
attribute, but it can check it.

Ensure ATTR_SEPT_VE_DISABLE is set in early boot.  panic() if it
is unset.  There is no sane way for Linux to run with this
attribute clear so a panic() is appropriate.

There's small window during boot before the check where kernel
has an early #VE handler. But the handler is only for port I/O
and will also panic() as soon as it sees any other #VE, such as
a one generated by a private memory access.

arm64: entry: avoid kprobe recursion

The cortex_a76_erratum_1463225_debug_handler() function is called when
handling debug exceptions (and synchronous exceptions from BRK
instructions), and so is called when a probed function executes. If the
compiler does not inline cortex_a76_erratum_1463225_debug_handler(), it
can be probed.

If cortex_a76_erratum_1463225_debug_handler() is probed, any debug
exception or software breakpoint exception will result in recursive
exceptions leading to a stack overflow. This can be triggered with the
ftrace multiple_probes selftest, and as per the example splat below.

This is a regression caused by commit:

  6459b8469753e9fe (""arm64: entry: consolidate Cortex-A76 erratum 1463225 workaround"")

... which removed the NOKPROBE_SYMBOL() annotation associated with the
function.

My intent was that cortex_a76_erratum_1463225_debug_handler() would be
inlined into its caller, el1_dbg(), which is marked noinstr and cannot
be probed. Mark cortex_a76_erratum_1463225_debug_handler() as
__always_inline to ensure this.

ring-buffer: Check for NULL cpu_buffer in ring_buffer_wake_waiters()

On some machines the number of listed CPUs may be bigger than the actual
CPUs that exist. The tracing subsystem allocates a per_cpu directory with
access to the per CPU ring buffer via a cpuX file. But to save space, the
ring buffer will only allocate buffers for online CPUs, even though the
CPU array will be as big as the nr_cpu_ids.

With the addition of waking waiters on the ring buffer when closing the
file, the ring_buffer_wake_waiters() now needs to make sure that the
buffer is allocated (with the irq_work allocated with it) before trying to
wake waiters, as it will cause a NULL pointer dereference.

While debugging this, I added a NULL check for the buffer itself (which is
OK to do), and also NULL pointer checks against buffer->buffers (which is
not fine, and will WARN) as well as making sure the CPU number passed in
is within the nr_cpu_ids (which is also not fine if it isn't).

ftrace: Fix use-after-free for dynamic ftrace_ops

KASAN reported a use-after-free with ftrace ops [1]. It was found from
vmcore that perf had registered two ops with the same content
successively, both dynamic. After unregistering the second ops, a
use-after-free occurred.

In ftrace_shutdown(), when the second ops is unregistered, the
FTRACE_UPDATE_CALLS command is not set because there is another enabled
ops with the same content.  Also, both ops are dynamic and the ftrace
callback function is ftrace_ops_list_func, so the
FTRACE_UPDATE_TRACE_FUNC command will not be set. Eventually the value
of 'command' will be 0 and ftrace_shutdown() will skip the rcu
synchronization.

However, ftrace may be activated. When the ops is released, another CPU
may be accessing the ops.  Add the missing synchronization to fix this
problem.

	switch (tm->op) {
        case BTRFS_MOD_LOG_KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING:
		BUG_ON(tm->slot < n);

This occurs because we replay the nodes in order that they happened, and
when we do a REPLACE we will log a REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING for every slot,
starting at 0.  'n' here is the number of items in this block, which in
this case was 1, but we had 2 REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING operations.

The actual root cause of this was that we were replaying operations for
a block that shouldn't have been replayed.  Consider the following
sequence of events

1. We have an already modified root, and we do a btrfs_get_tree_mod_seq().
2. We begin removing items from this root, triggering KEY_REPLACE for
   it's child slots.
3. We remove one of the 2 children this root node points to, thus triggering
   the root node promotion of the remaining child, and freeing this node.
4. We modify a new root, and re-allocate the above node to the root node of
   this other root.

The tree mod log looks something like this

	logical 0	op KEY_REPLACE (slot 1)			seq 2
	logical 0	op KEY_REMOVE (slot 1)			seq 3
	logical 0	op KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING (slot 0)	seq 4
	logical 4096	op LOG_ROOT_REPLACE (old logical 0)	seq 5
	logical 8192	op KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING (slot 1)	seq 6
	logical 8192	op KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING (slot 0)	seq 7
	logical 0	op LOG_ROOT_REPLACE (old logical 8192)	seq 8

>From here the bug is triggered by the following steps

1.  Call btrfs_get_old_root() on the new_root.
2.  We call tree_mod_log_oldest_root(btrfs_root_node(new_root)), which is
    currently logical 0.
3.  tree_mod_log_oldest_root() calls tree_mod_log_search_oldest(), which
    gives us the KEY_REPLACE seq 2, and since that's not a
    LOG_ROOT_REPLACE we incorrectly believe that we don't have an old
    root, because we expect that the most recent change should be a
    LOG_ROOT_REPLACE.
4.  Back in tree_mod_log_oldest_root() we don't have a LOG_ROOT_REPLACE,

CVE-2022-49899	2025-05-01T15:16:14.953	2025-10-01T16:15:50.350	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fscrypt: stop using keyrings subsystem for fscrypt_master_key

The approach of fs/crypto/ internally managing the fscrypt_master_key
structs as the payloads of ""struct key"" objects contained in a
""struct key"" keyring has outlived its usefulness.  The original idea was
to simplify the code by reusing code from the keyrings subsystem.
However, several issues have arisen that can't easily be resolved:

- When a master key struct is destroyed, blk_crypto_evict_key() must be
  called on any per-mode keys embedded in it.  (This started being the
  case when inline encryption support was added.)  Yet, the keyrings
  subsystem can arbitrarily delay the destruction of keys, even past the
  time the filesystem was unmounted.  Therefore, currently there is no
  easy way to call blk_crypto_evict_key() when a master key is
  destroyed.  Currently, this is worked around by holding an extra
  reference to the filesystem's request_queue(s).  But it was overlooked
  that the request_queue reference is *not* guaranteed to pin the
  corresponding blk_crypto_profile too; for device-mapper devices that
  support inline crypto, it doesn't.  This can cause a use-after-free.

- When the last inode that was using an incompletely-removed master key
  is evicted, the master key removal is completed by removing the key
  struct from the keyring.  Currently this is done via key_invalidate().
  Yet, key_invalidate() takes the key semaphore.  This can deadlock when
  called from the shrinker, since in fscrypt_ioctl_add_key(), memory is
  allocated with GFP_KERNEL under the same semaphore.

- More generally, the fact that the keyrings subsystem can arbitrarily
  delay the destruction of keys (via garbage collection delay, or via
  random processes getting temporary key references) is undesirable, as
  it means we can't strictly guarantee that all secrets are ever wiped.

- Doing the master key lookups via the keyrings subsystem results in the
  key_permission LSM hook being called.  fscrypt doesn't want this, as
  all access control for encrypted files is designed to happen via the
  files themselves, like any other files.  The workaround which SELinux
  users are using is to change their SELinux policy to grant key search
  access to all domains.  This works, but it is an odd extra step that
  shouldn't really have to be done.

The fix for all these issues is to change the implementation to what I
should have done originally: don't use the keyrings subsystem to keep
track of the filesystem's fscrypt_master_key structs.  Instead, just
store them in a regular kernel data structure, and rework the reference
counting, locking, and lifetime accordingly.  Retain support for
RCU-mode key lookups by using a hash table.  Replace fscrypt_sb_free()
with fscrypt_sb_delete(), which releases the keys synchronously and runs
a bit earlier during unmount, so that block devices are still available.

A side effect of this patch is that neither the master keys themselves
nor the filesystem keyrings will be listed in /proc/keys anymore.
(""Master key users"" and the master key users keyrings will still be
listed.)  However, this was mostly an implementation detail, and it was
intended just for debugging purposes.  I don't know of anyone using it.

This patch does *not* change how ""master key users"" (->mk_users) works;
that still uses the keyrings subsystem.  That is still needed for key
quotas, and changing that isn't necessary to solve the issues listed
above.  If we decide to change that too, it would be a separate patch.

I've marked this as fixing the original commit that added the fscrypt
keyring, but as noted above the most important issue that this patch
fixes wasn't introduced until the addition of inline encryption support."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

i2c: piix4: Fix adapter not be removed in piix4_remove()

In piix4_probe(), the piix4 adapter will be registered in:

   piix4_probe()
     piix4_add_adapters_sb800() / piix4_add_adapter()
       i2c_add_adapter()

Based on the probed device type, piix4_add_adapters_sb800() or single
piix4_add_adapter() will be called.
For the former case, piix4_adapter_count is set as the number of adapters,
while for antoher case it is not set and kept default *zero*.

When piix4 is removed, piix4_remove() removes the adapters added in
piix4_probe(), basing on the piix4_adapter_count value.
Because the count is zero for the single adapter case, the adapter won't
be removed and makes the sources allocated for adapter leaked, such as
the i2c client and device.

These sources can still be accessed by i2c or bus and cause problems.
An easily reproduced case is that if a new adapter is registered, i2c
will get the leaked adapter and try to call smbus_algorithm, which was
already freed:

====================================

HCI core will uses hci_rx_work() to process frame, which is queued to
the hdev->rx_q tail in hci_recv_frame() by HCI driver.

Yet the problem is that, HCI core may not free the skb after handling
ACL data packets. To be more specific, when start fragment does not
contain the L2CAP length, HCI core just copies skb into conn->rx_skb and
finishes frame process in l2cap_recv_acldata(), without freeing the skb,
which triggers the above memory leak.

This patch solves it by releasing the relative skb, after processing
the above case in l2cap_recv_acldata()."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Bluetooth: L2CAP: fix use-after-free in l2cap_conn_del()

When l2cap_recv_frame() is invoked to receive data, and the cid is
L2CAP_CID_A2MP, if the channel does not exist, it will create a channel.
However, after a channel is created, the hold operation of the channel
is not performed. In this case, the value of channel reference counting
is 1. As a result, after hci_error_reset() is triggered, l2cap_conn_del()
invokes the close hook function of A2MP to release the channel. Then
 l2cap_chan_unlock(chan) will trigger UAF issue.

The process is as follows:
Receive data:
l2cap_data_channel()
    a2mp_channel_create()  --->channel ref is 2
    l2cap_chan_put()       --->channel ref is 1

Triger event:
    hci_error_reset()
        hci_dev_do_close()
        ...

                l2cap_chan_del()     --->channel ref is 1
                a2mp_chan_close_cb() --->channel ref is 0, release channel

Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix use-after-free caused by l2cap_reassemble_sdu

Fix the race condition between the following two flows that run in
parallel:

1. l2cap_reassemble_sdu -> chan->ops->recv (l2cap_sock_recv_cb) ->
   __sock_queue_rcv_skb.

2. bt_sock_recvmsg -> skb_recv_datagram, skb_free_datagram.

An SKB can be queued by the first flow and immediately dequeued and
freed by the second flow, therefore the callers of l2cap_reassemble_sdu
can't use the SKB after that function returns. However, some places
continue accessing struct l2cap_ctrl that resides in the SKB's CB for a
short time after l2cap_reassemble_sdu returns, leading to a
use-after-free condition (the stack trace is below, line numbers for
kernel 5.19.8).

Fix it by keeping a local copy of struct l2cap_ctrl.

netfilter: ipset: enforce documented limit to prevent allocating huge memory

Daniel Xu reported that the hash:net,iface type of the ipset subsystem does
not limit adding the same network with different interfaces to a set, which
can lead to huge memory usage or allocation failure.

The quick reproducer is

During backref walking, at find_parent_nodes(), if we are dealing with a

resolve_indirect_refs(), or in the while loop that iterates over the refs
in the direct refs rbtree, we end up leaking the inode lists attached to
the direct refs we have in the direct refs rbtree that were not yet added
to the refs ulist passed as argument to find_parent_nodes(). Since they
were not yet added to the refs ulist and prelim_release() does not free
the lists, on error the caller can only free the lists attached to the
refs that were added to the refs ulist, all the remaining refs get their
inode lists never freed, therefore leaking their memory.

Fix this by having prelim_release() always free any attached inode list
to each ref found in the rbtree, and have find_parent_nodes() set the
ref's inode list to NULL once it transfers ownership of the inode list
to a ref added to the refs ulist passed to find_parent_nodes()."

of a ulist node, so we end up leaking lists if we have any attached to
the unodes.

`neigh` is in rose_loopback_timer() as `rose_loopback_neigh', and
the 'dev' in 'rose_loopback_neigh' is initialized sa nullptr.

We fix it by add NULL check in rose_transmit_clear_request(). When

There are two reasons for memleak in dsa_loop_init().

First, fixed_phy_register() create and register phy_device:

fixed_phy_register()
  get_phy_device()
    phy_device_create() # freed by phy_device_free()
  phy_device_register() # freed by phy_device_remove()

But fixed_phy_unregister() only calls phy_device_remove().
So the memory allocated in phy_device_create() is leaked.

Second, when mdio_driver_register() fail in dsa_loop_init(),
it just returns and there is no cleanup for phydevs.

Fix the problems by catching the error of mdio_driver_register()
in dsa_loop_init(), then calling both fixed_phy_unregister() and
phy_device_free() to release phydevs.
Also add a function for phydevs cleanup to avoid duplacate."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2025-46569	2025-05-01T20:15:37.887	2025-05-02T13:52:51.693	Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine. Prior to version 1.4.0, when run as a server, OPA exposes an HTTP Data API for reading and writing documents. Requesting a virtual document through the Data API entails policy evaluation, where a Rego query containing a single data document reference is constructed from the requested path. This query is then used for policy evaluation. A HTTP request path can be crafted in a way that injects Rego code into the constructed query. The evaluation result cannot be made to return any other data than what is generated by the requested path, but this path can be misdirected, and the injected Rego code can be crafted to make the query succeed or fail; opening up for oracle attacks or, given the right circumstances, erroneous policy decision results. Furthermore, the injected code can be crafted to be computationally expensive, resulting in a Denial Of Service (DoS) attack. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.0. A workaround involves having network access to OPA’s RESTful APIs being limited to `localhost` and/or trusted networks, unless necessary for production reasons.

net_sched: hfsc: Fix a UAF vulnerability in class handling

This patch fixes a Use-After-Free vulnerability in the HFSC qdisc class
handling. The issue occurs due to a time-of-check/time-of-use condition
in hfsc_change_class() when working with certain child qdiscs like netem
or codel.

The vulnerability works as follows:
1. hfsc_change_class() checks if a class has packets (q.qlen != 0)
2. It then calls qdisc_peek_len(), which for certain qdiscs (e.g.,
   codel, netem) might drop packets and empty the queue
3. The code continues assuming the queue is still non-empty, adding
   the class to vttree
4. This breaks HFSC scheduler assumptions that only non-empty classes
   are in vttree
5. Later, when the class is destroyed, this can lead to a Use-After-Free

The fix adds a second queue length check after qdisc_peek_len() to verify
the queue wasn't emptied."

nilfs2: fix kernel-infoleak in nilfs_ioctl_wrap_copy()

The ioctl helper function nilfs_ioctl_wrap_copy(), which exchanges a
metadata array to/from user space, may copy uninitialized buffer regions
to user space memory for read-only ioctl commands NILFS_IOCTL_GET_SUINFO
and NILFS_IOCTL_GET_CPINFO.

This can occur when the element size of the user space metadata given by
the v_size member of the argument nilfs_argv structure is larger than the
size of the metadata element (nilfs_suinfo structure or nilfs_cpinfo
structure) on the file system side.

usb: gadget: u_audio: don't let userspace block driver unbind

In the unbind callback for f_uac1 and f_uac2, a call to snd_card_free()

resources to be released, which happens when the refcount falls to zero.
Since userspace can keep the refcount incremented by not closing the
relevant file descriptor, the call to unbind may block indefinitely.
This can cause a deadlock during reboot, as evidenced by the following
blocked task observed on my machine:

The issue can also be observed by opening the card with arecord and
then stopping the process through the shell before unbinding:

still disconnect the card as desired, but defer the task of freeing the
resources to the core once userspace closes its file descriptor."

CVE-2023-53054	2025-05-02T16:15:24.483	2025-05-05T20:54:45.973	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: dwc2: fix a devres leak in hw_enable upon suspend resume

Each time the platform goes to low power, PM suspend / resume routines
call: __dwc2_lowlevel_hw_enable -> devm_add_action_or_reset().
This adds a new devres each time.
This may also happen at runtime, as dwc2_lowlevel_hw_enable() can be
called from udc_start().

This can be seen with tracing:
- echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/dev/devres_log/enable
- go to low power
- cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace

A new ""ADD"" entry is found upon each low power cycle:
... devres_log: 49000000.usb-otg ADD 82a13bba devm_action_release (8 bytes)
... devres_log: 49000000.usb-otg ADD 49889daf devm_action_release (8 bytes)
...

A second issue is addressed here:
- regulator_bulk_enable() is called upon each PM cycle (suspend/resume).
- regulator_bulk_disable() never gets called.

So the reference count for these regulators constantly increase, by one
upon each low power cycle, due to missing regulator_bulk_disable() call
in __dwc2_lowlevel_hw_disable().

The original fix that introduced the devm_add_action_or_reset() call,
fixed an issue during probe, that happens due to other errors in
dwc2_driver_probe() -> dwc2_core_reset(). Then the probe fails without
disabling regulators, when dr_mode == USB_DR_MODE_PERIPHERAL.

Rather fix the error path: disable all the low level hardware in the
error path, by using the ""hsotg->ll_hw_enabled"" flag. Checking dr_mode
has been introduced to avoid a dual call to dwc2_lowlevel_hw_disable().
""ll_hw_enabled"" should achieve the same (and is used currently in the
remove() routine)."

fscrypt_destroy_keyring() must be called after all potentially-encrypted

security_sb_delete(), this means that fscrypt_destroy_keyring() must be
called *after* security_sb_delete().

This fixes a WARN_ON followed by a NULL dereference, only possible if
Landlock was being used on encrypted files."

Bluetooth: HCI: Fix global-out-of-bounds

To loop a variable-length array, hci_init_stage_sync(stage) considers
that stage[i] is valid as long as stage[i-1].func is valid.
Thus, the last element of stage[].func should be intentionally invalid
as hci_init0[], le_init2[], and others did.
However, amp_init1[] and amp_init2[] have no invalid element, letting
hci_init_stage_sync() keep accessing amp_init1[] over its valid range.
This patch fixes this by adding {} in the last of amp_init1[] and
amp_init2[].

During reboot all drivers PM shutdown callbacks are invoked.
In iavf_shutdown() the adapter state is changed to __IAVF_REMOVE.
In ice_shutdown() the call chain above is executed, which at some point
calls iavf_remove(). However iavf_remove() expects the VF to be in one
of the states __IAVF_RUNNING, __IAVF_DOWN or __IAVF_INIT_FAILED. If
that's not the case it sleeps forever.
So if iavf_shutdown() gets invoked before iavf_remove() the system will
hang indefinitely because the adapter is already in state __IAVF_REMOVE.

Fix this by returning from iavf_remove() if the state is __IAVF_REMOVE,
as we already went through iavf_shutdown()."

ACPI: PPTT: Fix to avoid sleep in the atomic context when PPTT is absent

Commit 0c80f9e165f8 (""ACPI: PPTT: Leave the table mapped for the runtime usage"")
enabled to map PPTT once on the first invocation of acpi_get_pptt() and
never unmapped the same allowing it to be used at runtime with out the
hassle of mapping and unmapping the table. This was needed to fetch LLC
information from the PPTT in the cpuhotplug path which is executed in
the atomic context as the acpi_get_table() might sleep waiting for a
mutex.

However it missed to handle the case when there is no PPTT on the system
which results in acpi_get_pptt() being called from all the secondary
CPUs attempting to fetch the LLC information in the atomic context
without knowing the absence of PPTT resulting in the splat like below:

We need to properly clean-up all the paired MPTCP-level
resources and be sure to release the msk last, even when
the unaccepted subflow is destroyed by the TCP internals
via inet_child_forget().

We can re-use the existing MPTCP_WORK_CLOSE_SUBFLOW infra,
explicitly checking that for the critical scenario: the
closed subflow is the MPC one, the msk is not accepted and
eventually going through full cleanup.

With such change, __mptcp_destroy_sock() is always called
on msk sockets, even on accepted ones. We don't need anymore
to transiently drop one sk reference at msk clone time.

Please note this commit depends on the parent one:

CVE-2023-53073	2025-05-02T16:15:26.330	2025-05-05T20:54:45.973	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf/x86/amd/core: Always clear status for idx

The variable 'status' (which contains the unhandled overflow bits) is
not being properly masked in some cases, displaying the following
warning:

  WARNING: CPU: 156 PID: 475601 at arch/x86/events/amd/core.c:972 amd_pmu_v2_handle_irq+0x216/0x270

This seems to be happening because the loop is being continued before
the status bit being unset, in case x86_perf_event_set_period()
returns 0. This is also causing an inconsistency because the ""handled""
counter is incremented, but the status bit is not cleaned.

Move the bit cleaning together above, together when the ""handled""
counter is incremented."

nfsd: don't replace page in rq_pages if it's a continuation of last page

The splice read calls nfsd_splice_actor to put the pages containing file
data into the svc_rqst->rq_pages array. It's possible however to get a
splice result that only has a partial page at the end, if (e.g.) the
filesystem hands back a short read that doesn't cover the whole page.

nfsd_splice_actor will plop the partial page into its rq_pages array and
return. Then later, when nfsd_splice_actor is called again, the
remainder of the page may end up being filled out. At this point,
nfsd_splice_actor will put the page into the array _again_ corrupting
the reply. If this is done enough times, rq_next_page will overrun the
array and corrupt the trailing fields -- the rq_respages and
rq_next_page pointers themselves.

If we've already added the page to the array in the last pass, don't add
it to the array a second time when dealing with a splice continuation.
This was originally handled properly in nfsd_splice_actor, but commit
91e23b1c3982 (""NFSD: Clean up nfsd_splice_actor()"") removed the check
for it."

CVE-2023-53087	2025-05-02T16:15:27.667	2025-05-05T20:54:45.973	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/i915/active: Fix misuse of non-idle barriers as fence trackers

Users reported oopses on list corruptions when using i915 perf with a
number of concurrently running graphics applications.  Root cause analysis
pointed at an issue in barrier processing code -- a race among perf open /
close replacing active barriers with perf requests on kernel context and
concurrent barrier preallocate / acquire operations performed during user
context first pin / last unpin.

When adding a request to a composite tracker, we try to reuse an existing
fence tracker, already allocated and registered with that composite.  The
tracker we obtain may already track another fence, may be an idle barrier,
or an active barrier.

If the tracker we get occurs a non-idle barrier then we try to delete that
barrier from a list of barrier tasks it belongs to.  However, while doing
that we don't respect return value from a function that performs the
barrier deletion.  Should the deletion ever fail, we would end up reusing
the tracker still registered as a barrier task.  Since the same structure
field is reused with both fence callback lists and barrier tasks list,
list corruptions would likely occur.

Barriers are now deleted from a barrier tasks list by temporarily removing
the list content, traversing that content with skip over the node to be
deleted, then populating the list back with the modified content.  Should
that intentionally racy concurrent deletion attempts be not serialized,
one or more of those may fail because of the list being temporary empty.

Related code that ignores the results of barrier deletion was initially
introduced in v5.4 by commit d8af05ff38ae (""drm/i915: Allow sharing the
idle-barrier from other kernel requests"").  However, all users of the
barrier deletion routine were apparently serialized at that time, then the
issue didn't exhibit itself.  Results of git bisect with help of a newly
developed igt@gem_barrier_race@remote-request IGT test indicate that list
corruptions might start to appear after commit 311770173fac (""drm/i915/gt:
Schedule request retirement when timeline idles""), introduced in v5.5.

Respect results of barrier deletion attempts -- mark the barrier as idle
only if successfully deleted from the list.  Then, before proceeding with
setting our fence as the one currently tracked, make sure that the tracker
we've got is not a non-idle barrier.  If that check fails then don't use
that tracker but go back and try to acquire a new, usable one.

v3: use unlikely() to document what outcome we expect (Andi),
  - fix bad grammar in commit description.
v2: no code changes,
  - blame commit 311770173fac (""drm/i915/gt: Schedule request retirement
    when timeline idles""), v5.5, not commit d8af05ff38ae (""drm/i915: Allow
    sharing the idle-barrier from other kernel requests""), v5.4,
  - reword commit description.

==================================================================

The problem is that the inode contains an xattr entry with ea_inum of 15
when cleaning up an orphan inode <15>. When evict inode <15>, the reference
counting of the corresponding EA inode is decreased. When EA inode <15> is
found by find_inode_fast() in __ext4_iget(), it is found that the EA inode
holds the I_FREEING flag and waits for the EA inode to complete deletion.
As a result, when inode <15> is being deleted, we wait for inode <15> to
complete the deletion, resulting in an infinite loop and triggering Hung
Task. To solve this problem, we only need to check whether the ino of EA
inode and parent is the same before getting EA inode."

CVE-2023-53094	2025-05-02T16:15:28.363	2025-05-05T20:54:45.973	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: fix race on RX DMA shutdown

From time to time DMA completion can come in the middle of DMA shutdown:

<process ctx>:				<IRQ>:
lpuart32_shutdown()
  lpuart_dma_shutdown()
    del_timer_sync()
					lpuart_dma_rx_complete()
					  lpuart_copy_rx_to_tty()
					    mod_timer()
    lpuart_dma_rx_free()

When the timer fires a bit later, sport->dma_rx_desc is NULL:

To fix this fold del_timer_sync() into lpuart_dma_rx_free() after

drm/ttm: Fix a NULL pointer dereference

The LRU mechanism may look up a resource in the process of being removed
from an object. The locking rules here are a bit unclear but it looks
currently like res->bo assignment is protected by the LRU lock, whereas
bo->resource is protected by the object lock, while *clearing* of
bo->resource is also protected by the LRU lock. This means that if
we check that bo->resource points to the LRU resource under the LRU
lock we should be safe.
So perform that check before deciding to swap out a bo. That avoids
dereferencing a NULL bo->resource in ttm_bo_swapout()."

ice: xsk: disable txq irq before flushing hw

ice_qp_dis() intends to stop a given queue pair that is a target of xsk
pool attach/detach. One of the steps is to disable interrupts on these
queues. It currently is broken in a way that txq irq is turned off
*after* HW flush which in turn takes no effect.

ice_qp_dis():

- start xdpsock WITHOUT loading xdp prog
- run xdp_rxq_info with XDP_TX action on this interface
- start traffic

bonding: restore bond's IFF_SLAVE flag if a non-eth dev enslave fails

syzbot reported a warning[1] where the bond device itself is a slave and
we try to enslave a non-ethernet device as the first slave which fails
but then in the error path when ether_setup() restores the bond device
it also clears all flags. In my previous fix[2] I restored the
IFF_MASTER flag, but I didn't consider the case that the bond device
itself might also be a slave with IFF_SLAVE set, so we need to restore
that flag as well. Use the bond_ether_setup helper which does the right
thing and restores the bond's flags properly.

Steps to reproduce using a nlmon dev:
 $ ip l add nlmon0 type nlmon
 $ ip l add bond1 type bond
 $ ip l add bond2 type bond
 $ ip l set bond1 master bond2
 $ ip l set dev nlmon0 master bond1
 $ ip -d l sh dev bond1
 22: bond1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,MASTER> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue master bond2 state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
 (now bond1's IFF_SLAVE flag is gone and we'll hit a warning[3] if we
  try to delete it)

net/mlx5e: Fix cleanup null-ptr deref on encap lock

During module is unloaded while a peer tc flow is still offloaded,
first the peer uplink rep profile is changed to a nic profile, and so
neigh encap lock is destroyed. Next during unload, the VF reps netdevs
are unregistered which causes the original non-peer tc flow to be deleted,
which deletes the peer flow. The peer flow deletion detaches the encap
entry and try to take the already destroyed encap lock, causing the
below trace.

Fix this by clearing peer flows during tc eswitch cleanup

use pskb_expand_head() if the headroom was less than
XDP_PACKET_HEADROOM.  This however uses kmalloc to expand the head,
which will later allow consume_skb() to free the skb while is it still
in use by AF_XDP.

Previously if the headroom was less than XDP_PACKET_HEADROOM we
continued on to allocate a new skb from pages so this restores that
behavior.

net/smc: fix NULL sndbuf_desc in smc_cdc_tx_handler()

When performing a stress test on SMC-R by rmmod mlx5_ib driver
during the wrk/nginx test, we found that there is a probability
of triggering a panic while terminating all link groups.

This issue dues to the race between smc_smcr_terminate_all()
and smc_buf_create().

smc_buf_create

conn->sndbuf_desc = NULL;

						/* panic dues to NULL sndbuf_desc */

seen during cqe processing."

i40e: Fix kernel crash during reboot when adapter is in recovery mode

If the driver detects during probe that firmware is in recovery
mode then i40e_init_recovery_mode() is called and the rest of
probe function is skipped including pci_set_drvdata(). Subsequent
i40e_shutdown() called during shutdown/reboot dereferences NULL
pointer as pci_get_drvdata() returns NULL.

To fix call pci_set_drvdata() also during entering to recovery mode.

Reproducer:
1) Lets have i40e NIC with firmware in recovery mode
2) Run reboot

PCI: s390: Fix use-after-free of PCI resources with per-function hotplug

On s390 PCI functions may be hotplugged individually even when they
belong to a multi-function device. In particular on an SR-IOV device VFs
may be removed and later re-added.

In commit a50297cf8235 (""s390/pci: separate zbus creation from
scanning"") it was missed however that struct pci_bus and struct
zpci_bus's resource list retained a reference to the PCI functions MMIO
resources even though those resources are released and freed on
hot-unplug. These stale resources may subsequently be claimed when the
PCI function re-appears resulting in use-after-free.

One idea of fixing this use-after-free in s390 specific code that was
investigated was to simply keep resources around from the moment a PCI
function first appeared until the whole virtual PCI bus created for
a multi-function device disappears. The problem with this however is
that due to the requirement of artificial MMIO addreesses (address
cookies) extra logic is then needed to keep the address cookies
compatible on re-plug. At the same time the MMIO resources semantically
belong to the PCI function so tying their lifecycle to the function
seems more logical.

Instead a simpler approach is to remove the resources of an individually
hot-unplugged PCI function from the PCI bus's resource list while
keeping the resources of other PCI functions on the PCI bus untouched.

This is done by introducing pci_bus_remove_resource() to remove an
individual resource. Similarly the resource also needs to be removed
from the struct zpci_bus's resource list. It turns out however, that
there is really no need to add the MMIO resources to the struct
zpci_bus's resource list at all and instead we can simply use the
zpci_bar_struct's resource pointer directly."

af_unix: fix struct pid leaks in OOB support

syzbot reported struct pid leak [1].

Issue is that queue_oob() calls maybe_add_creds() which potentially
holds a reference on a pid.

But skb->destructor is not set (either directly or by calling
unix_scm_to_skb())

This means that subsequent kfree_skb() or consume_skb() would leak
this reference.

In this fix, I chose to fully support scm even for the OOB message.

When unregistering a net device, unregister_netdevice_many_notify()
sets the device's reg_state to NETREG_UNREGISTERING, calls notifiers
with NETDEV_UNREGISTER, and adds the device to the todo list.

Later on, devices in the todo list are processed by netdev_run_todo().
netdev_run_todo() waits devices' reference count become 1 while
rebdoadcasting NETDEV_UNREGISTER notification.

When cfusbl_device_notify() is called with NETDEV_UNREGISTER multiple
times, the parent device might be freed.  This could cause UAF.
Processing NETDEV_UNREGISTER multiple times also causes inbalance of
reference count for the module.

This patch fixes the issue by accepting only first NETDEV_UNREGISTER
notification."

For GETFSMAP calls, the caller selects a physical block device by
writing its block number into fsmap_head.fmh_keys[01].fmr_device.
To query mappings for a subrange of the device, the starting byte of the
range is written to fsmap_head.fmh_keys[0].fmr_physical and the last
byte of the range goes in fsmap_head.fmh_keys[1].fmr_physical.

IOWs, to query what mappings overlap with bytes 3-14 of /dev/sda, you'd
set the inputs as follows:

	fmh_keys[0] = { .fmr_device = major(8, 0), .fmr_physical = 3},
	fmh_keys[1] = { .fmr_device = major(8, 0), .fmr_physical = 14},

Which would return you whatever is mapped in the 12 bytes starting at
physical offset 3.

The crash is due to insufficient range validation of keys[1] in
ext4_getfsmap_datadev.  On 1k-block filesystems, block 0 is not part of
the filesystem, which means that s_first_data_block is nonzero.
ext4_get_group_no_and_offset subtracts this quantity from the blocknr
argument before cracking it into a group number and a block number
within a group.  IOWs, block group 0 spans blocks 1-8192 (1-based)
instead of 0-8191 (0-based) like what happens with larger blocksizes.

The net result of this encoding is that blocknr < s_first_data_block is
not a valid input to this function.  The end_fsb variable is set from
the keys that are copied from userspace, which means that in the above
example, its value is zero.  That leads to an underflow here:

	blocknr = blocknr - le32_to_cpu(es->s_first_data_block);

The division then operates on -1:

	offset = do_div(blocknr, EXT4_BLOCKS_PER_GROUP(sb)) >>
		EXT4_SB(sb)->s_cluster_bits;

Leaving an impossibly large group number (2^32-1) in blocknr.
ext4_getfsmap_check_keys checked that keys[0

In version 1.0.0, OpenVM is vulnerable to overflow through byte decomposition of pc in AUIPC chip. A typo results in the highest limb of pc being range checked to 8-bits instead of 6-bits. This results in the if statement never being triggered because the enumeration gives i=0,1,2, when instead the enumeration should give i=1,2,3, leaving pc_limbs[3] range checked to 8-bits instead of 6-bits. This leads to a vulnerability where the pc_limbs decomposition differs from the true pc, which means a malicious prover can make the destination register take a different value than the AUIPC instruction dictates, by making the decomposition overflow the BabyBear field.

vmxnet3: Fix malformed packet sizing in vmxnet3_process_xdp

vmxnet3 driver's XDP handling is buggy for packet sizes using ring0 (that
is, packet sizes between 128 - 3k bytes).

We noticed MTU-related connectivity issues with Cilium's service load-
balancing in case of vmxnet3 as NIC underneath. A simple curl to a HTTP
backend service where the XDP LB was doing IPIP encap led to overly large
packet sizes but only for *some* of the packets (e.g. HTTP GET request)
while others (e.g. the prior TCP 3WHS) looked completely fine on the wire.

In fact, the pcap recording on the backend node actually revealed that the
node with the XDP LB was leaking uninitialized kernel data onto the wire
for the affected packets, for example, while the packets should have been
152 bytes their actual size was 1482 bytes, so the remainder after 152 bytes
was padded with whatever other data was in that page at the time (e.g. we
saw user/payload data from prior processed packets).

We only noticed this through an MTU issue, e.g. when the XDP LB node and
the backend node both had the same MTU (e.g. 1500) then the curl request
got dropped on the backend node's NIC given the packet was too large even
though the IPIP-encapped packet normally would never even come close to
the MTU limit. Lowering the MTU on the XDP LB (e.g. 1480) allowed to let
the curl request succeed (which also indicates that the kernel ignored the
padding, and thus the issue wasn't very user-visible).

Commit e127ce7699c1 (""vmxnet3: Fix missing reserved tailroom"") was too eager
to also switch xdp_prepare_buff() from rcd->len to rbi->len. It really needs
to stick to rcd->len which is the actual packet length from the descriptor.
The latter we also feed into vmxnet3_process_xdp_small(), by the way, and
it indicates the correct length needed to initialize the xdp->{data,data_end}
parts. For e127ce7699c1 (""vmxnet3: Fix missing reserved tailroom"") the
relevant part was adapting xdp_init_buff() to address the warning given the
xdp_data_hard_end() depends on xdp->frame_sz. With that fixed, traffic on
the wire looks good again."

bpf: track changes_pkt_data property for global functions

When processing calls to certain helpers, verifier invalidates all
packet pointers in a current state. For example, consider the
following program:

    __attribute__((__noinline__))
    long skb_pull_data(struct __sk_buff *sk, __u32 len)
    {
        return bpf_skb_pull_data(sk, len);
    }

    SEC(""tc"")
    int test_invalidate_checks(struct __sk_buff *sk)
    {
        int *p = (void *)(long)sk->data;
        if ((void *)(p + 1) > (void *)(long)sk->data_end) return TCX_DROP;
        skb_pull_data(sk, 0);
        *p = 42;
        return TCX_PASS;
    }

After a call to bpf_skb_pull_data() the pointer 'p' can't be used
safely. See function filter.c:bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data() for a list
of such helpers.

At the moment verifier invalidates packet pointers when processing
helper function calls, and does not traverse global sub-programs when
processing calls to global sub-programs. This means that calls to
helpers done from global sub-programs do not invalidate pointers in
the caller state. E.g. the program above is unsafe, but is not
rejected by verifier.

This commit fixes the omission by computing field
bpf_subprog_info->changes_pkt_data for each sub-program before main
verification pass.
changes_pkt_data should be set if:
- subprogram calls helper for which bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data
  returns true;
- subprogram calls a global function,
  for which bpf_subprog_info->changes_pkt_data should be set.

The verifier.c:check_cfg() pass is modified to compute this
information. The commit relies on depth first instruction traversal
done by check_cfg() and absence of recursive function calls:
- check_cfg() would eventually visit every call to subprogram S in a
  state when S is fully explored;
- when S is fully explored:
  - every direct helper call within S is explored
    (and thus changes_pkt_data is set if needed);
  - every call to subprogram S1 called by S was visited with S1 fully
    explored (and thus S inherits changes_pkt_data from S1).

The downside of such approach is that dead code elimination is not
taken into account: if a helper call inside global function is dead
because of current configuration, verifier would conservatively assume
that the call occurs for the purpose of the changes_pkt_data
computation."					
CVE-2024-58100	2025-05-05T15:15:53.913	2025-05-09T08:15:18.937	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: check changes_pkt_data property for extension programs

When processing calls to global sub-programs, verifier decides whether
to invalidate all packet pointers in current state depending on the
changes_pkt_data property of the global sub-program.

Because of this, an extension program replacing a global sub-program
must be compatible with changes_pkt_data property of the sub-program
being replaced.

This commit:
- adds changes_pkt_data flag to struct bpf_prog_aux:
  - this flag is set in check_cfg() for main sub-program;
  - in jit_subprogs() for other sub-programs;
- modifies bpf_check_attach_btf_id() to check changes_pkt_data flag;
- moves call to check_attach_btf_id() after the call to check_cfg(),
  because it needs changes_pkt_data flag to be set:

    bpf_check:
      ...                             ...
    - check_attach_btf_id             resolve_pseudo_ldimm64
      resolve_pseudo_ldimm64   -->    bpf_prog_is_offloaded

      check_cfg                     + check_attach_btf_id
      ...                             ...

The following fields are set by check_attach_btf_id():
- env->ops
- prog->aux->attach_btf_trace
- prog->aux->attach_func_name
- prog->aux->attach_func_proto
- prog->aux->dst_trampoline
- prog->aux->mod
- prog->aux->saved_dst_attach_type
- prog->aux->saved_dst_prog_type
- prog->expected_attach_type

Neither of these fields are used by resolve_pseudo_ldimm64() or
bpf_prog_offload_verifier_prep() (for netronome and netdevsim
drivers), so the reordering is safe."

bpf: consider that tail calls invalidate packet pointers

Tail-called programs could execute any of the helpers that invalidate
packet pointers. Hence, conservatively assume that each tail call
invalidates packet pointers.

Making the change in bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data() automatically makes
use of check_cfg() logic that computes 'changes_pkt_data' effect for
global sub-programs, such that the following program could be
rejected:

    int tail_call(struct __sk_buff *sk)

CVE-2025-46340	2025-05-05T19:15:56.627	2025-09-03T18:47:53.703	Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.0.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, due to an oversight in the validation performed in `UrlPreviewService` and `MkUrlPreview`, it is possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary CSS into the `MkUrlPreview` component. `UrlPreviewService.wrap` falls back to returning the original URL if it's using a protocol that is likely to not be understood by Misskey, IE something other than `http` or `https`. This both can de-anonymize users and_allow further attacks in the client. Additionally, `MkUrlPreview` doesn't escape CSS when applying a `background-image` property, allowing an attacker to craft a URL that applies arbitrary styles to the preview element. Theoretically, an attacker can craft a CSS injection payload to create a fake error message that can deceive the user into giving away their credentials or similar sensitive information. Version 2025.4.1 contains a patch for the issue.	7.2	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

CVE-2025-46571	2025-05-05T19:15:57.050	2025-06-17T20:18:30.580	Open WebUI is a self-hosted artificial intelligence platform designed to operate entirely offline.

CVE-2025-46720	2025-05-05T19:15:57.330	2025-09-19T19:53:56.810	Keystone is a content management system for Node.js. Prior to version 6.5.0, `{field}.isFilterable` access control can be bypassed in `update` and `delete` mutations by adding additional unique filters. These filters can be used as an oracle to probe the existence or value of otherwise unreadable fields. Specifically, when a mutation includes a `where` clause with multiple unique filters (e.g. `id` and `email`), Keystone will attempt to match records even if filtering by the latter fields would normally be rejected by `field.isFilterable` or `list.defaultIsFilterable`. This can allow malicious actors to infer the presence of a particular field value when a filter is successful in returning a result. This affects any project relying on the default or dynamic `isFilterable` behavior (at the list or field level) to prevent external users from using the filtering of fields as a discovery mechanism. While this access control is respected during `findMany` operations, it was not completely enforced during `update` and `delete` mutations when accepting more than one unique `where` values in filters. This has no impact on projects using `isFilterable: false` or `defaultIsFilterable: false` for sensitive fields, or for those who have otherwise omitted filtering by these fields from their GraphQL schema. This issue has been patched in `@keystone-6/core` version 6.5.0. To mitigate this issue in older versions where patching is not a viable pathway, set `isFilterable: false` statically for relevant fields to prevent filtering by them earlier in the access control pipeline (that is, don't use functions); set `{field}.graphql.omit.read: true` for relevant fields, which implicitly removes filtering by these fields from the GraphQL schema; and/or deny `update` and `delete` operations for the relevant lists completely.	3.1	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

CVE-2025-46730	2025-05-05T20:15:21.313	2025-09-03T18:18:17.520	MobSF is a mobile application security testing tool used. Typically, MobSF is deployed on centralized internal or cloud-based servers that also host other security tools and web applications. Access to the MobSF web interface is often granted to internal security teams, audit teams, and external vendors.  MobSF provides a feature that allows users to upload ZIP files for static analysis. Upon upload, these ZIP files are automatically extracted and stored within the MobSF directory. However, in versions up to and including 4.3.2, this functionality lacks a check on the total uncompressed size of the ZIP file, making it vulnerable to a ZIP of Death (zip bomb) attack. Due to the absence of safeguards against oversized extractions, an attacker can craft a specially prepared ZIP file that is small in compressed form but expands to a massive size upon extraction. Exploiting this, an attacker can exhaust the server's disk space, leading to a complete denial of service (DoS) not just for MobSF, but also for any other applications or websites hosted on the same server. This vulnerability can lead to complete server disruption in an organization which can affect other internal portals and tools too (which are hosted on the same server). If some organization has created their customized cloud based mobile security tool using MobSF core then an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to crash their servers. Commit 6987a946485a795f4fd38cebdb4860b368a1995d fixes this issue. As an additional mitigation, it is recommended to implement a safeguard that checks the total uncompressed size of any uploaded ZIP file before extraction. If the estimated uncompressed size exceeds a safe threshold (e.g., 100 MB), MobSF should reject the file and notify the user.	6.8	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Attributes extension of the league/commonmark library (versions 1.5.0 through 2.6.x) allows remote attackers to insert malicious JavaScript calls into HTML. The league/commonmark library provides configuration options such as `html_input: 'strip'` and `allow_unsafe_links: false` to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by stripping raw HTML and disallowing unsafe links. However, when the Attributes Extension is enabled, it introduces a way for users to inject arbitrary HTML attributes into elements via Markdown syntax using curly braces. Version 2.7.0 contains three changes to prevent this XSS attack vector: All attributes starting with `on` are considered unsafe and blocked by default; support for an explicit allowlist of allowed HTML attributes; and manually-added `href` and `src` attributes now respect the existing `allow_unsafe_links` configuration option. If upgrading is not feasible, please consider disabling the `AttributesExtension` for untrusted users and/or filtering the rendered HTML through a library like HTMLPurifier.	6.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

CVE-2025-46728	2025-05-06T01:15:50.790	2025-08-01T21:25:50.847	cpp-httplib is a C++ header-only HTTP/HTTPS server and client library. Prior to version 0.20.1, the library fails to enforce configured size limits on incoming request bodies when `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` is used or when no `Content-Length` header is provided. A remote attacker can send a chunked request without the terminating zero-length chunk, causing uncontrolled memory allocation on the server. This leads to potential exhaustion of system memory and results in a server crash or unresponsiveness. Version 0.20.1 fixes the issue by enforcing limits during parsing. If the limit is exceeded at any point during reading, the connection is terminated immediately. A short-term workaround through a Reverse Proxy is available. If updating the library immediately is not feasible, deploy a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) in front of the `cpp-httplib` application. Configure the proxy to enforce maximum request body size limits, thereby stopping excessively large requests before they reach the vulnerable library code.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2025-30165	2025-05-06T17:16:11.660	2025-07-31T18:05:30.623	vLLM is an inference and serving engine for large language models. In a multi-node vLLM deployment using the V0 engine, vLLM uses ZeroMQ for some multi-node communication purposes. The secondary vLLM hosts open a `SUB` ZeroMQ socket and connect to an `XPUB` socket on the primary vLLM host. When data is received on this `SUB` socket, it is deserialized with `pickle`. This is unsafe, as it can be abused to execute code on a remote machine. Since the vulnerability exists in a client that connects to the primary vLLM host, this vulnerability serves as an escalation point. If the primary vLLM host is compromised, this vulnerability could be used to compromise the rest of the hosts in the vLLM deployment. Attackers could also use other means to exploit the vulnerability without requiring access to the primary vLLM host. One example would be the use of ARP cache poisoning to redirect traffic to a malicious endpoint used to deliver a payload with arbitrary code to execute on the target machine. Note that this issue only affects the V0 engine, which has been off by default since v0.8.0. Further, the issue only applies to a deployment using tensor parallelism across multiple hosts, which we do not expect to be a common deployment pattern. Since V0 is has been off by default since v0.8.0 and the fix is fairly invasive, the maintainers of vLLM have decided not to fix this issue. Instead, the maintainers recommend that users ensure their environment is on a secure network in case this pattern is in use. The V1 engine is not affected by this issue.	8.0	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2025-46815	2025-05-06T18:15:38.697	2025-08-26T16:02:35.990	The identity infrastructure software ZITADEL offers developers the ability to manage user sessions using the Session API. This API enables the use of IdPs for authentication, known as idp intents. Following a successful idp intent, the client receives an id and token on a predefined URI. These id and token can then be used to authenticate the user or their session. However, prior to versions 3.0.0, 2.71.9, and 2.70.10, it was possible to exploit this feature by repeatedly using intents. This allowed an attacker with access to the application’s URI to retrieve the id and token, enabling them to authenticate on behalf of the user. It's important to note that the use of additional factors (MFA) prevents a complete authentication process and, consequently, access to the ZITADEL API. Versions 3.0.0, 2.71.9, and 2.70.10 contain a fix for the issue. No known workarounds other than upgrading are available.	8.0	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N

CVE-2025-46820	2025-05-06T19:16:00.223	2025-05-07T14:13:20.483	phpgt/Dom provides access to modern DOM APIs. Versions of phpgt/Dom prior to 4.1.8 expose the GITHUB_TOKEN in the Dom workflow run artifact. The ci.yml workflow file uses actions/upload-artifact@v4 to upload the build artifact. This artifact is a zip of the current directory, which includes the automatically generated .git/config file containing the run's GITHUB_TOKEN. Seeing as the artifact can be downloaded prior to the end of the workflow, there is a few seconds where an attacker can extract the token from the artifact and use it with the GitHub API to push malicious code or rewrite release commits in your repository. Any downstream user of the repository may be affected, but the token should only be valid for the duration of the workflow run, limiting the time during which exploitation could occur.

CVE-2025-30147	2025-05-07T19:16:07.880	2025-05-08T14:39:09.683	Besu Native contains scripts and tooling that is used to build and package the native libraries used by the Ethereum client Hyperledger Besu. Besu 24.7.1 through 25.2.2, corresponding to besu-native versions 0.9.0 through 1.2.1, have a potential consensus bug for the precompiles ALTBN128_ADD (0x06), ALTBN128_MUL (0x07), and ALTBN128_PAIRING (0x08). These precompiles were reimplemented in besu-native using gnark-crypto's bn254 implementation, as the former implementation used a library which was no longer maintained and not sufficiently performant. The new gnark implementation was initially added in version 0.9.0 of besu-native but was not utilized by Besu until version 0.9.2 in Besu 24.7.1. The issue is that there are EC points which may be crafted which are in the correct subgroup but are not on the curve and the besu-native gnark implementation was relying on subgroup checks to perform point-on-curve checks as well. The version of gnark-crypto used at the time did not do this check when performing subgroup checks. The result is that it was possible for Besu to give an incorrect result and fall out of consensus when executing one of these precompiles against a specially crafted input point. Additionally, homogenous Besu-only networks can potentially enshrine invalid state which would be incorrect and difficult to process with patched versions of besu which handle these calls correctly. The underlying defect has been patched in besu-native release 1.3.0. The fixed version of Besu is version 25.3.0. As a workaround for versions of Besu with the problem, the native precompile for altbn128 may be disabled in favor of the pure-java implementation. The pure java implementation is significantly slower, but does not have this consensus issue.

CVE-2025-32441	2025-05-07T23:15:53.537	2025-06-17T19:48:03.580	Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Prior to version 2.2.14, when using the `Rack::Session::Pool` middleware, simultaneous rack requests can restore a deleted rack session, which allows the unauthenticated user to occupy that session. Rack session middleware prepares the session at the beginning of request, then saves is back to the store with possible changes applied by host rack application. This way the session becomes to be a subject of race conditions in general sense over concurrent rack requests. When using the `Rack::Session::Pool` middleware, and provided the attacker can acquire a session cookie (already a major issue), the session may be restored if the attacker can trigger a long running request (within that same session) adjacent to the user logging out, in order to retain illicit access even after a user has attempted to logout. Version 2.2.14 contains a patch for the issue. Some other mitigations are available. Either ensure the application invalidates sessions atomically by marking them as logged out e.g., using a `logged_out` flag, instead of deleting them, and check this flag on every request to prevent reuse; or implement a custom session store that tracks session invalidation timestamps and refuses to accept session data if the session was invalidated after the request began.	4.2	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N		
CVE-2025-35939	2025-05-07T23:15:54.103	2025-06-03T20:59:34.117	Craft CMS stores arbitrary content provided by unauthenticated users in session files. This content could be accessed and executed, possibly using an independent vulnerability. Craft CMS redirects requests that require authentication to the login page and generates a session file on the server at '/var/lib/php/sessions'. Such session files are named 'sess_[session_value]', where '[session_value]' is provided to the client in a 'Set-Cookie' response header. Craft CMS stores the return URL requested by the client without sanitizing parameters. Consequently, an unauthenticated client can introduce arbitrary values, such as PHP code, to a known local file location on the server. Craft CMS versions 5.7.5 and 4.15.3 have been released to address this issue.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N		
CVE-2025-46727	2025-05-07T23:15:54.267	2025-06-17T19:44:47.010	Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Prior to versions 2.2.14, 3.0.16, and 3.1.14, `Rack::QueryParser` parses query strings and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies into Ruby data structures without imposing any limit on the number of parameters, allowing attackers to send requests with extremely large numbers of parameters. The vulnerability arises because `Rack::QueryParser` iterates over each `&`-separated key-value pair and adds it to a Hash without enforcing an upper bound on the total number of parameters. This allows an attacker to send a single request containing hundreds of thousands (or more) of parameters, which consumes excessive memory and CPU during parsing. An attacker can trigger denial of service by sending specifically crafted HTTP requests, which can cause memory exhaustion or pin CPU resources, stalling or crashing the Rack server. This results in full service disruption until the affected worker is restarted. Versions 2.2.14, 3.0.16, and 3.1.14 fix the issue. Some other mitigations are available. One may use middleware to enforce a maximum query string size or parameter count, or employ a reverse proxy (such as Nginx) to limit request sizes and reject oversized query strings or bodies. Limiting request body sizes and query string lengths at the web server or CDN level is an effective mitigation.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

It seems we're hitting the error path in virtsnd_probe(), which
triggers a virtsnd_remove() which iterates over the substreams
calling cancel_work_sync() on the elapsed_period work_struct.

Looking at the code, from earlier in:
virtsnd_probe()->virtsnd_build_devs()->virtsnd_pcm_parse_cfg()

We set snd->nsubstreams, allocate the snd->substreams, and if
we then hit an error on the info allocation or something in
virtsnd_ctl_query_info() fails, we will exit without having
initialized the elapsed_period work_struct.

When that error path unwinds we then call virtsnd_remove()
which as long as the substreams array is allocated, will iterate
through calling cancel_work_sync() on the uninitialized work
struct hitting this warning.

Takashi Iwai suggested this fix, which initializes the substreams
structure right after allocation, so that if we hit the error
paths we avoid trying to cleanup uninitialized data.

Note: I have not yet managed to reproduce the issue myself, so
this patch has had limited testing.

bpf: Fix kmemleak warning for percpu hashmap

Vlad Poenaru reported the following kmemleak issue:

  unreferenced object 0x606fd7c44ac8 (size 32):

      do_syscall_64+0x7b/0x150
      entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53

Further investigation shows the reason is due to not 8-byte aligned
store of percpu pointer in htab_elem_set_ptr():
  *(void __percpu **)(l->key + key_size) = pptr;

Note that the whole htab_elem alignment is 8 (for x86_64). If the key_size
is 4, that means pptr is stored in a location which is 4 byte aligned but
not 8 byte aligned. In mm/kmemleak.c, scan_block() scans the memory based
on 8 byte stride, so it won't detect above pptr, hence reporting the memory
leak.

In htab_map_alloc(), we already have

        htab->elem_size = sizeof(struct htab_elem) +
                          round_up(htab->map.key_size, 8);
        if (percpu)
                htab->elem_size += sizeof(void *);
        else
                htab->elem_size += round_up(htab->map.value_size, 8);

So storing pptr with 8-byte alignment won't cause any problem and can fix
kmemleak too.

The issue can be reproduced with bpf selftest as well:
  1. Enable CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK config
  2. Add a getchar() before skel destroy in test_hash_map() in prog_tests/for_each.c.
     The purpose is to keep map available so kmemleak can be detected.
  3. run './test_progs -t for_each/hash_map &' and a kmemleak should be reported."

tty: Require CAP_SYS_ADMIN for all usages of TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT

This requirement was overeagerly loosened in commit 2f83e38a095f
(""tty: Permit some TIOCL_SETSEL modes without CAP_SYS_ADMIN""), but as
it turns out,

  (1) the logic I implemented there was inconsistent (apologies!),

  (2) TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT might actually be a small security risk
      after all, and

  (3) TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT is only meant to be used by the mouse
      daemon (GPM or Consolation), which runs as CAP_SYS_ADMIN
      already.

In more detail:

1. The previous patch has inconsistent logic:

   In commit 2f83e38a095f (""tty: Permit some TIOCL_SETSEL modes
   without CAP_SYS_ADMIN""), we checked for sel_mode ==
   TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT, but overlooked that the lower four bits of
   this ""mode"" parameter were actually used as an additional way to
   pass an argument.  So the patch did actually still require
   CAP_SYS_ADMIN, if any of the mouse button bits are set, but did not
   require it if none of the mouse buttons bits are set.

   This logic is inconsistent and was not intentional.  We should have
   the same policies for using TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT independent of the
   value of the ""hidden"" mouse button argument.

   I sent a separate documentation patch to the man page list with
   more details on TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT:
   https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250223091342.35523-2-gnoack3000@gmail.com/

2. TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT is indeed a potential security risk which can
   let an attacker simulate ""keyboard"" input to command line
   applications on the same terminal, like TIOCSTI and some other
   TIOCLINUX ""selection mode"" IOCTLs.

   By enabling mouse reporting on a terminal and then injecting mouse
   reports through TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT, an attacker can simulate
   mouse movements on the same terminal, similar to the TIOCSTI
   keystroke injection attacks that were previously possible with
   TIOCSTI and other TIOCL_SETSEL selection modes.

   Many programs (including libreadline/bash) are then prone to
   misinterpret these mouse reports as normal keyboard input because
   they do not expect input in the X11 mouse protocol form.  The
   attacker does not have complete control over the escape sequence,
   but they can at least control the values of two consecutive bytes
   in the binary mouse reporting escape sequence.

   I went into more detail on that in the discussion at
   https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250221.0a947528d8f3@gnoack.org/

   It is not equally trivial to simulate arbitrary keystrokes as it
   was with TIOCSTI (commit 83efeeeb3d04 (""tty: Allow TIOCSTI to be
   disabled"")), but the general mechanism is there, and together with
   the small number of existing legit use cases (see below), it would
   be better to revert back to requiring CAP_SYS_ADMIN for
   TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT, as it was already the case before
   commit 2f83e38a095f (""tty: Permit some TIOCL_SETSEL modes without
   CAP_SYS_ADMIN"").

3. TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT is only used by the mouse daemons (GPM or
   Consolation), and they are the only legit use case:

   To quote console_codes(4):

     The mouse tracking facility is intended to return
     xterm(1)-compatible mouse status reports.  Because the console
     driver has no way to know the device or type of the mouse, these
     reports are returned in the console input stream only when the
     virtual terminal driver receives a mouse update ioctl.  These
     ioctls must be generated by a mouse-aware user-mode application
     such as the gpm(8) daemon.

   Jared Finder has also confirmed in
   https://lore.kernel.org/all/491f3df9de6593df8e70dbe77614b026@finder.org/
   that Emacs does not call TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT directly, and it
   would be difficult to find good reasons for doing that, given that
   it would interfere with the reports that GPM is sending.

sched/eevdf: Fix se->slice being set to U64_MAX and resulting crash

There is a code path in dequeue_entities() that can set the slice of a
sched_entity to U64_MAX, which sometimes results in a crash.

The offending case is when dequeue_entities() is called to dequeue a
delayed group entity, and then the entity's parent's dequeue is delayed.
In that case:

1. In the if (entity_is_task(se)) else block at the beginning of
   dequeue_entities(), slice is set to
   cfs_rq_min_slice(group_cfs_rq(se)). If the entity was delayed, then
   it has no queued tasks, so cfs_rq_min_slice() returns U64_MAX.
2. The first for_each_sched_entity() loop dequeues the entity.
3. If the entity was its parent's only child, then the next iteration
   tries to dequeue the parent.
4. If the parent's dequeue needs to be delayed, then it breaks from the
   first for_each_sched_entity() loop _without updating slice_.
5. The second for_each_sched_entity() loop sets the parent's ->slice to
   the saved slice, which is still U64_MAX.

This throws off subsequent calculations with potentially catastrophic
results. A manifestation we saw in production was:

6. In update_entity_lag(), se->slice is used to calculate limit, which
   ends up as a huge negative number.
7. limit is used in se->vlag = clamp(vlag, -limit, limit). Because limit
   is negative, vlag > limit, so se->vlag is set to the same huge
   negative number.
8. In place_entity(), se->vlag is scaled, which overflows and results in
   another huge (positive or negative) number.
9. The adjusted lag is subtracted from se->vruntime, which increases or
   decreases se->vruntime by a huge number.
10. pick_eevdf() calls entity_eligible()/vruntime_eligible(), which
    incorrectly returns false because the vruntime is so far from the
    other vruntimes on the queue, causing the
    (vruntime - cfs_rq->min_vruntime) * load calulation to overflow.
11. Nothing appears to be eligible, so pick_eevdf() returns NULL.
12. pick_next_entity() tries to dereference the return value of
    pick_eevdf() and crashes.

Dumping the cfs_rq states from the core dumps with drgn showed tell-tale
huge vruntime ranges and bogus vlag values, and I also traced se->slice
being set to U64_MAX on live systems (which was usually ""benign"" since
the rest of the runqueue needed to be in a particular state to crash).

Fix it in dequeue_entities() by always setting slice from the first
non-empty cfs_rq."

 BTRFS error (device sdc): zoned: write pointer offset mismatch of zones in raid1 profile

When a RAID1 block-group is created and a write pointer mismatch between
the disks in the RAID set is detected, btrfs sets the alloc_offset to the
length of the block group marking it as full. Afterwards the code expects
that a balance operation will evacuate the data in this block-group and
repair the problems.

But before this is possible, the new space of this block-group will be
accounted in the free space cache. But in __btrfs_

scsi: ufs: mcq: Add NULL check in ufshcd_mcq_abort()

A race can occur between the MCQ completion path and the abort handler:
once a request completes, __blk_mq_free_request() sets rq->mq_hctx to
NULL, meaning the subsequent ufshcd_mcq_req_to_hwq() call in
ufshcd_mcq_abort() can return a NULL pointer. If this NULL pointer is
dereferenced, the kernel will crash.

Add a NULL check for the returned hwq pointer. If hwq is NULL, log an
error and return FAILED, preventing a potential NULL-pointer
dereference.  As suggested by Bart, the ufshcd_cmd_inflight() check is
removed.

Fix niu_try_msix() to not cause a fatal trap on sparc systems.

Set PCI_DEV_FLAGS_MSIX_TOUCH_ENTRY_DATA_FIRST on the struct pci_dev to
work around a bug in the hardware or firmware.

For each vector entry in the msix table, niu chips will cause a fatal
trap if any registers in that entry are read before that entries'
ENTRY_DATA register is written to. Testing indicates writes to other
registers are not sufficient to prevent the fatal trap, however the value
does not appear to matter. This only needs to happen once after power up,
so simply rebooting into a kernel lacking this fix will NOT cause the
trap.

I can reproduce this issue with the following steps:

1) When a dirty swapcache page is isolated by reclaim process and the
   page isn't locked, inject memory failure for the page. 
   me_swapcache_dirty() clears uptodate flag and tries to delete from lru,
   but fails.  Reclaim process will put the hwpoisoned page back to lru.

2) The process that maps the hwpoisoned page exits, the page is deleted
   the page will never be freed and will be in the lru forever.

3) If we trigger a reclaim again and tries to reclaim the page,
   add_to_swap() will trigger VM_BUG_ON_FOLIO due to the uptodate flag is
   cleared.

To fix it, skip the hwpoisoned page in shrink_folio_list().  Besides, the
hwpoison folio may not be unmapped by hwpoison_user_mappings() yet, unmap
it in shrink_folio_list(), otherwise the folio will fail to be unmaped by
hwpoison_user_mappings() since the folio isn't in lru list."

CVE-2025-44021	2025-05-08T17:16:01.753	2025-05-12T17:32:52.810	OpenStack Ironic before 29.0.1 can write unintended files to a target node disk during image handling (if a deployment was performed via the API). A malicious project assigned as a node owner can provide a path to any local file (readable by ironic-conductor), which may then be written to the target node disk. This is difficult to exploit in practice, because a node deployed in this manner should never reach the ACTIVE state, but it still represents a danger in environments running with non-default, insecure configurations such as with automated cleaning disabled. The fixed versions are 24.1.3, 26.1.1, and 29.0.1.	2.8	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N

This is because the LVCMDQ queue memory are managed by devres, while that
dmam_free_coherent() is called in the context of devm_action_release().

Jason pointed out that ""arm_smmu_impl_probe() has mis-ordered the devres
callbacks if ops->device_remove() is going to be manually freeing things
that probe allocated"":
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-iommu/20250407174408.GB1722458@nvidia.com/

In fact, tegra241_cmdqv_init_structures() only allocates memory resources
which means any failure that it generates would be similar to -ENOMEM, so
there is no point in having that ""falling back to standard SMMU"" routine,
as the standard SMMU would likely fail to allocate memory too.

Remove the unwind part in tegra241_cmdqv_init_structures(), and return a
proper error code to ask SMMU driver to call tegra241_cmdqv_remove() via
impl_ops->device_remove(). Then, drop tegra241_vintf_free_lvcmdq() since
devres will take care of that."

PCI: pciehp: Avoid unnecessary device replacement check

Hot-removal of nested PCI hotplug ports suffers from a long-standing race
condition which can lead to a deadlock:  A parent hotplug port acquires
pci_lock_rescan_remove(), then waits for pciehp to unbind from a child
hotplug port.  Meanwhile that child hotplug port tries to acquire
pci_lock_rescan_remove() as well in order to remove its own children.

The deadlock only occurs if the parent acquires pci_lock_rescan_remove()
first, not if the child happens to acquire it first.

Several workarounds to avoid the issue have been proposed and discarded
over the years, e.g.:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/4c882e25194ba8282b78fe963fec8faae7cf23eb.1529173804.git.lukas@wunner.de/

A proper fix is being worked on, but needs more time as it is nontrivial
and necessarily intrusive.

Recent commit 9d573d19547b (""PCI: pciehp: Detect device replacement during
system sleep"") provokes more frequent occurrence of the deadlock when
removing more than one Thunderbolt device during system sleep.  The commit
sought to detect device replacement, but also triggered on device removal.
Differentiating reliably between replacement and removal is impossible
because pci_get_dsn() returns 0 both if the device was removed, as well as
if it was replaced with one lacking a Device Serial Number.

Avoid the more frequent occurrence of the deadlock by checking whether the
hotplug port itself was hot-removed.  If so, there's no sense in checking
whether its child device was replaced.

This works because the ->resume_noirq() callback is invoked in top-down
order for the entire hierarchy:  A parent hotplug port detecting device
replacement (or removal) marks all children as removed using
pci_dev_set_disconnected() and a child hotplug port can then reliably
detect being removed."

fs/jfs: Prevent integer overflow in AG size calculation

The JFS filesystem calculates allocation group (AG) size using 1 <<
l2agsize in dbExtendFS(). When l2agsize exceeds 31 (possible with >2TB
aggregates on 32-bit systems), this 32-bit shift operation causes undefined
behavior and improper AG sizing.

On 32-bit architectures:
- Left-shifting 1 by 32+ bits results in 0 due to integer overflow
- This creates invalid AG sizes (0 or garbage values) in
sbi->bmap->db_agsize
- Subsequent block allocations would reference invalid AG structures
- Could lead to:
  - Filesystem corruption during extend operations
  - Kernel crashes due to invalid memory accesses
  - Security vulnerabilities via malformed on-disk structures

Fix by casting to s64 before shifting:
bmp->db_agsize = (s64)1 << l2agsize;

This ensures 64-bit arithmetic even on 32-bit architectures. The cast
matches the data type of db_agsize (s64) and follows similar patterns in

The same logic was applied to pidff_find_special_field and although

net: dsa: clean up FDB, MDB, VLAN entries on unbind

As explained in many places such as commit b117e1e8a86d (""net: dsa:
delete dsa_legacy_fdb_add and dsa_legacy_fdb_del""), DSA is written given
the assumption that higher layers have balanced additions/deletions.
As such, it only makes sense to be extremely vocal when those
assumptions are violated and the driver unbinds with entries still
present.

But Ido Schimmel points out a very simple situation where that is wrong:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/ZDazSM5UsPPjQuKr@shredder/
(also briefly discussed by me in the aforementioned commit).

Basically, while the bridge bypass operations are not something that DSA
explicitly documents, and for the majority of DSA drivers this API
simply causes them to go to promiscuous mode, that isn't the case for
all drivers. Some have the necessary requirements for bridge bypass
operations to do something useful - see dsa_switch_supports_uc_filtering().

Although in tools/testing/selftests/net/forwarding/local_termination.sh,
we made an effort to popularize better mechanisms to manage address
filters on DSA interfaces from user space - namely macvlan for unicast,
and setsockopt(IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP) - through mtools - for multicast, the
fact is that 'bridge fdb add ... self static local' also exists as
kernel UAPI, and might be useful to someone, even if only for a quick
hack.

It seems counter-productive to block that path by implementing shim
.ndo_fdb_add and .ndo_fdb_del operations which just return -EOPNOTSUPP
in order to prevent the ndo_dflt_fdb_add() and ndo_dflt_fdb_del() from
running, although we could do that.

Accepting that cleanup is necessary seems to be the only option.
Especially since we appear to be coming back at this from a different
angle as well. Russell King is noticing that the WARN_ON() triggers even
for VLANs:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/Z_li8Bj8bD4-BYKQ@shell.armlinux.org.uk/

What happens in the bug report above is that dsa_port_do_vlan_del() fails,
then the VLAN entry lingers on, and then we warn on unbind and leak it.

This is not a straight revert of the blamed commit, but we now add an
informational print to the kernel log (to still have a way to see
that bugs exist), and some extra comments gathered from past years'
experience, to justify the logic."

net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: fix -ENOENT when deleting VLANs and MST is unsupported

Russell King reports that on the ZII dev rev B, deleting a bridge VLAN
from a user port fails with -ENOENT:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/Z_lQXNP0s5-IiJzd@shell.armlinux.org.uk/

This comes from mv88e6xxx_port_vlan_leave() -> mv88e6xxx_mst_put(),
which tries to find an MST entry in &chip->msts associated with the SID,
but fails and returns -ENOENT as such.

But we know that this chip does not support MST at all, so that is not
surprising. The question is why does the guard in mv88e6xxx_mst_put()
not exit early:

	if (!sid)
		return 0;

And the answer seems to be simple: the sid comes from vlan.sid which
supposedly was previously populated by mv88e6xxx_vtu_get().
But some chip->info->ops->vtu_getnext() implementations do not populate
vlan.sid, for example see mv88e6185_g1_vtu_getnext(). In that case,
later in mv88e6xxx_port_vlan_leave() we are using a garbage sid which is
just residual stack memory.

Testing for sid == 0 covers all cases of a non-bridge VLAN or a bridge
VLAN mapped to the default MSTI. For some chips, SID 0 is valid and
installed by mv88e6xxx_stu_setup(). A chip which does not support the
STU would implicitly only support mapping all VLANs to the default MSTI,
so although SID 0 is not valid, it would be sufficient, if we were to
zero-initialize the vlan structure, to fix the bug, due to the
coincidence that a test for vlan.sid == 0 already exists and leads to
the same (correct) behavior.

Another option which would be sufficient would be to add a test for
mv88e6xxx_has_stu() inside mv88e6xxx_mst_put(), symmetric to the one
which already exists in mv88e6xxx_mst_get(). But that placement means
the caller will have to dereference vlan.sid, which means it will access
uninitialized memory, which is not nice even if it ignores it later.

So we end up making both modifications, in order to not rely just on the
sid == 0 coincidence, but also to avoid having uninitialized structure
fields which might get temporarily accessed."

drm/xe/userptr: fix notifier vs folio deadlock

User is reporting what smells like notifier vs folio deadlock, where
migrate_pages_batch() on core kernel side is holding folio lock(s) and
then interacting with the mappings of it, however those mappings are
tied to some userptr, which means calling into the notifier callback and
grabbing the notifier lock. With perfect timing it looks possible that
the pages we pulled from the hmm fault can get sniped by
migrate_pages_batch() at the same time that we are holding the notifier
lock to mark the pages as accessed/dirty, but at this point we also want
to grab the folio locks(s) to mark them as dirty, but if they are
contended from notifier/migrate_pages_batch side then we deadlock since
folio lock won't be dropped until we drop the notifier lock.

Fortunately the mark_page_accessed/dirty is not really needed in the
first place it seems and should have already been done by hmm fault, so
just remove it.

    refcount_dec_and_lock
     spin_lock // clp->cl_lock

When a file is opened, an nfs4_delegation is allocated with sc_count
initialized to 1, and the file_lease holds a reference to the delegation.
The file_lease is then associated with the file through kernel_setlease.

The disassociation is performed in nfsd4_delegreturn via the following
call chain:
nfsd4_delegreturn --> destroy_delegation --> destroy_unhashed_deleg -->
nfs4_unlock_deleg_lease --> kernel_setlease --> generic_delete_lease
The corresponding sc_count reference will be released after this
disassociation.

Since nfsd_break_one_deleg executes while holding the flc_lock, the
disassociation process becomes blocked when attempting to acquire flc_lock
in generic_delete_lease. This means:
1) sc_count in nfsd_break_one_deleg will not be decremented to 0;
2) The nfs4_put_stid called by nfsd_break_one_deleg will not attempt to
acquire cl_lock;
3) Consequently, no deadlock condition is created.

Given that sc_count in nfsd_break_one_deleg remains non-zero, we can
safely perform refcount_dec on sc_count directly. This approach
effectively avoids triggering deadlock warnings."

igc: fix PTM cycle trigger logic

Writing to clear the PTM status 'valid' bit while the PTM cycle is
triggered results in unreliable PTM operation. To fix this, clear the
PTM 'trigger' and status after each PTM transaction.

The issue can be reproduced with the following:

$ sudo phc2sys -R 1000 -O 0 -i tsn0 -m

Note: 1000 Hz (-R 1000) is unrealistically large, but provides a way to
quickly reproduce the issue.

PHC2SYS exits with:

""ioctl PTP_OFFSET_PRECISE: Connection timed out"" when the PTM transaction
  fails

This patch also fixes a hang in igc_probe() when loading the igc
driver in the kdump kernel on systems supporting PTM.

The igc driver running in the base kernel enables PTM trigger in
igc_probe().  Therefore the driver is always in PTM trigger mode,
except in brief periods when manually triggering a PTM cycle.

When a crash occurs, the NIC is reset while PTM trigger is enabled.
Due to a hardware problem, the NIC is subsequently in a bad busmaster
state and doesn't handle register reads/writes.  When running
igc_probe() in the kdump kernel, the first register access to a NIC
register hangs driver probing and ultimately breaks kdump.

With this patch, igc has PTM trigger disabled most of the time,
and the trigger is only enabled for very brief (10 - 100 us) periods
when manually triggering a PTM cycle.  Chances that a crash occurs
during a PTM trigger are not 0, but extremely reduced."

iommu: Clear iommu-dma ops on cleanup

If iommu_device_register() encounters an error, it can end up tearing
down already-configured groups and default domains, however this
currently still leaves devices hooked up to iommu-dma (and even
historically the behaviour in this area was at best inconsistent across
architectures/drivers...) Although in the case that an IOMMU is present
whose driver has failed to probe, users cannot necessarily expect DMA to
work anyway, it's still arguable that we should do our best to put
things back as if the IOMMU driver was never there at all, and certainly
the potential for crashing in iommu-dma itself is undesirable. Make sure
we clean up the dev->dma_iommu flag along with everything else."					
CVE-2025-37878	2025-05-09T07:16:09.020	2025-05-12T17:32:32.760	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf/core: Fix WARN_ON(!ctx) in __free_event() for partial init

Move the get_ctx(child_ctx) call and the child_event->ctx assignment to
occur immediately after the child event is allocated. Ensure that
child_event->ctx is non-NULL before any subsequent error path within
inherit_event calls free_event(), satisfying the assumptions of the
cleanup code.

Details:

There's no clear Fixes tag, because this bug is a side-effect of
multiple interacting commits over time (up to 15 years old), not
a single regression.

The code initially incremented refcount then assigned context
immediately after the child_event was created. Later, an early
validity check for child_event was added before the
refcount/assignment. Even later, a WARN_ON_ONCE() cleanup check was
added, assuming event->ctx is valid if the pmu_ctx is valid.
The problem is that the WARN_ON_ONCE() could trigger after the initial
check passed but before child_event->ctx was assigned, violating its
precondition. The solution is to assign child_event->ctx right after
its initial validation. This ensures the context exists for any
subsequent checks or cleanup routines, resolving the WARN_ON_ONCE().

To resolve it, defer the refcount update and child_event->ctx assignment
directly after child_event->pmu_ctx is set but before checking if the
parent event is orphaned. The cleanup routine depends on
event->pmu_ctx being non-NULL before it verifies event->ctx is
non-NULL. This also maintains the author's original intent of passing
in child_ctx to find_get_pmu_context before its refcount/assignment.

usb: xhci: Fix isochronous Ring Underrun/Overrun event handling

The TRB pointer of these events points at enqueue at the time of error
occurrence on xHCI 1.1+ HCs or it's NULL on older ones. By the time we
are handling the event, a new TD may be queued at this ring position.

I can trigger this race by rising interrupt moderation to increase IRQ
handling delay. Similar delay may occur naturally due to system load.

If this ever happens after a Missed Service Error, missed TDs will be
skipped and the new TD processed as if it matched the event. It could
be given back prematurely, risking data loss or buffer UAF by the xHC.

Don't complete TDs on xrun events and don't warn if queued TDs don't
match the event's TRB pointer, which can be NULL or a link/no-op TRB.
Don't warn if there are no queued TDs at all.

Now that it's safe, also handle xrun events if the skip flag is clear.

This reverts commit 9bdd10d57a88 (""ASoC: ops: Shift tested values in

updates.

There are two ways the platform_max could be interpreted; the maximum
register value, or the maximum value the control can be set to. The
patch moved from treating the value as a control value to a register
one. When the patch was applied it was technically correct as
snd_soc_limit_volume() also used the register interpretation. However,
even then most of the other usages treated platform_max as a
control value, and snd_soc_limit_volume() has since been updated to
also do so in commit fb9ad24485087 (""ASoC: ops: add correct range
check for limiting volume""). That patch however, missed updating
snd_soc_put_volsw() back to the control interpretation, and fixing
snd_soc_info_volsw_range(). The control interpretation makes more
sense as limiting is typically done from the machine driver, so it is
appropriate to use the customer facing representation rather than the
internal codec representation. Update all the code to consistently use
this interpretation of platform_max.

Finally, also add some comments to the soc_mixer_control struct to
hopefully avoid further patches switching between the two approaches."

CVE-2025-47269	2025-05-09T21:15:51.263	2025-05-12T17:32:32.760	code-server runs VS Code on any machine anywhere through browser access. Prior to version 4.99.4, a maliciously crafted URL using the proxy subpath can result in the attacker gaining access to the session token. Failure to properly validate the port for a proxy request can result in proxying to an arbitrary domain. The malicious URL `https://<code-server>/proxy/test@evil.com/path` would be proxied to `test@evil.com/path` where the attacker could exfiltrate a user's session token. Any user who runs code-server with the built-in proxy enabled and clicks on maliciously crafted links that go to their code-server instances with reference to /proxy. Normally this is used to proxy local ports, however the URL can reference the attacker's domain instead, and the connection is then proxied to that domain, which will include sending cookies. With access to the session cookie, the attacker can then log into code-server and have full access to the machine hosting code-server as the user running code-server.

CVE-2025-47270	2025-05-12T11:15:51.050	2025-05-12T17:32:32.760	nimiq/core-rs-albatross is a Rust implementation of the Nimiq Proof-of-Stake protocol based on the Albatross consensus algorithm. The `nimiq-network-libp2p` subcrate of nimiq/core-rs-albatross is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to uncontrolled memory allocation. Specifically, the implementation of the `Discovery` network message handling allocates a buffer based on a length value provided by the peer, without enforcing an upper bound. Since this length is a `u32`, a peer can trigger allocations of up to 4 GB, potentially leading to memory exhaustion and node crashes. As Discovery messages are regularly exchanged for peer discovery, this vulnerability can be exploited repeatedly. The patch for this vulnerability is formally released as part of v1.1.0. The patch implements a limit to the discovery message size of 1 MB and also resizes the message buffer size incrementally as the data is read. No known workarounds are available.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2025-46717	2025-05-12T15:16:01.260	2025-07-09T01:51:08.943	sudo-rs is a memory safe implementation of sudo and su written in Rust. Prior to version 0.2.6, users with no (or very limited) sudo privileges can determine whether files exists in folders that they otherwise cannot access using `sudo --list <pathname>`. Users with local access to a machine can discover the existence/non-existence of certain files, revealing potentially sensitive information in the file names. This information can also be used in conjunction with other attacks. Version 0.2.6 fixes the vulnerability.	3.3	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2025-46718	2025-05-12T15:16:01.397	2025-07-09T01:45:32.727	sudo-rs is a memory safe implementation of sudo and su written in Rust. Prior to version 0.2.6, users with limited sudo privileges (e.g. execution of a single command) can list sudo privileges of other users using the `-U` flag. This vulnerability allows users with limited sudo privileges to enumerate the sudoers file, revealing sensitive information about other users' permissions. Attackers can collect information that can be used to more targeted attacks. Systems where users either do not have sudo privileges or have the ability to run all commands as root through sudo (the default configuration on most systems) are not affected by this advisory. Version 0.2.6 fixes the vulnerability.	3.3	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2025-47274	2025-05-12T15:16:01.530	2025-05-12T17:32:32.760	ToolHive is a utility designed to simplify the deployment and management of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Due to the ordering of code used to start an MCP server container, versions of ToolHive prior to 0.0.33 inadvertently store secrets in the run config files which are used to restart stopped containers. This means that an attacker who has access to the home folder of the user who starts the MCP server can read secrets without needing access to the secrets store itself. This only applies to secrets which were used in containers whose run configs exist at a point in time - other secrets remaining inaccessible. ToolHive 0.0.33 fixes the issue. Some workarounds are available. Stop and delete any running MCP servers, or manually remove any runconfigs from `$HOME/Library/Application Support/toolhive/runconfigs/` (macOS) or `$HOME/.state/toolhive/runconfigs/` (Linux).

CVE-2025-30159	2025-05-13T15:15:56.167	2025-08-26T14:48:11.997	Kirby is an open-source content management system. A vulnerability in versions prior to 3.9.8.3, 3.10.1.2, and 4.7.1 affects all Kirby sites that use the `snippet()` helper or `$kirby->snippet()` method with a dynamic snippet name (such as a snippet name that depends on request or user data). Sites that only use fixed calls to the `snippet()` helper/`$kirby->snippet()` method (i.e. calls with a simple string for the snippet name) are *not* affected. A missing path traversal check allowed attackers to navigate and access all files on the server that were accessible to the PHP process, including files outside of the snippets root or even outside of the Kirby installation. PHP code within such files was executed. Such attacks first require an attack vector in the site code that is caused by dynamic snippet names, such as `snippet('tags-' . get('tags'))`. It generally also requires knowledge of the site structure and the server's file system by the attacker, although it can be possible to find vulnerable setups through automated methods such as fuzzing. In a vulnerable setup, this could cause damage to the confidentiality and integrity of the server. The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.9.8.3, Kirby 3.10.1.2, and Kirby 4.7.1. In all of the mentioned releases, Kirby maintainers have added a check for the snippet path that ensures that the resulting path is contained within the configured snippets root. Snippet paths that point outside of the snippets root will not be loaded.	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

Sites that use other server software (such as Apache, nginx or Caddy) are not affected. A missing path traversal check allowed attackers to navigate all files on the server that were accessible to the PHP process, including files outside of the Kirby installation. The vulnerable implementation delegated all existing files to PHP, including existing files outside of the document root. This leads to a different response that allows attackers to determine whether the requested file exists. Because Kirby's router only delegates such requests to PHP and does not load or execute them, contents of the files were not exposed as PHP treats requests to files outside of the document root as invalid. The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.9.8.3, Kirby 3.10.1.2, and Kirby 4.7.1. In all of the mentioned releases, the maintainers of Kirby have updated the router to check if existing static files are within the document root. Requests to files outside the document root are treated as page requests of the error page and will no longer allow to determine whether the file exists or not.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2025-31493	2025-05-13T16:15:30.093	2025-08-26T14:33:24.970	Kirby is an open-source content management system. A vulnerability in versions prior to 3.9.8.3, 3.10.1.2, and 4.7.1 affects all Kirby sites that use the `collection()` helper or `$kirby->collection()` method with a dynamic collection name (such as a collection name that depends on request or user data). Sites that only use fixed calls to the `collection()` helper/`$kirby->collection()` method (i.e. calls with a simple string for the collection name) are *not* affected. A missing path traversal check allowed attackers to navigate and access all files on the server that were accessible to the PHP process, including files outside of the collections root or even outside of the Kirby installation. PHP code within such files was executed. Such attacks first require an attack vector in the site code that is caused by dynamic collection names, such as `collection('tags-' . get('tags'))`. It generally also requires knowledge of the site structure and the server's file system by the attacker, although it can be possible to find vulnerable setups through automated methods such as fuzzing. In a vulnerable setup, this could cause damage to the confidentiality and integrity of the server. The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.9.8.3, Kirby 3.10.1.2, and Kirby 4.7.1. In all of the mentioned releases, the maintainers of Kirby have added a check for the collection path that ensures that the resulting path is contained within the configured collections root. Collection paths that point outside of the collections root will not be loaded.	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

CVE-2025-46721	2025-05-13T16:15:31.750	2025-06-23T14:55:07.967	nosurf is cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection middleware for Go. A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.2.0 allows an attacker who controls content on the target site, or on a subdomain of the target site (either via XSS, or otherwise) to bypass CSRF checks and issue requests on user's behalf. Due to misuse of the Go `net/http` library, nosurf categorizes all incoming requests as plain-text HTTP requests, in which case the `Referer` header is not checked to have the same origin as the target webpage. If the attacker has control over HTML contents on either the target website (e.g. `example.com`), or on a website hosted on a subdomain of the target (e.g. `attacker.example.com`), they will also be able to manipulate cookies set for the target website. By acquiring the secret CSRF token from the cookie, or overriding the cookie with a new token known to the attacker, `attacker.example.com` is able to craft cross-site requests to `example.com`. A patch for the issue was released in nosurf 1.2.0. In lieu of upgrading to a patched version of nosurf, users may additionally use another HTTP middleware to ensure that a non-safe HTTP request is coming from the same origin (e.g. by requiring a `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin` header in the request).	6.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

CVE-2025-47278	2025-05-13T16:15:32.187	2025-05-13T19:35:18.080	Flask is a web server gateway interface (WSGI) web application framework. In Flask 3.1.0, the way fallback key configuration was handled resulted in the last fallback key being used for signing, rather than the current signing key. Signing is provided by the `itsdangerous` library. A list of keys can be passed, and it expects the last (top) key in the list to be the most recent key, and uses that for signing. Flask was incorrectly constructing that list in reverse, passing the signing key first. Sites that have opted-in to use key rotation by setting `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` care likely to unexpectedly be signing their sessions with stale keys, and their transition to fresher keys will be impeded. Sessions are still signed, so this would not cause any sort of data integrity loss. Version 3.1.1 contains a patch for the issue.

Starting in the 7.x branch and prior to versions 13.4.2 and 15.1.2, the 'Send email' workflow does not HTML encode the user-provided field values in the sent email message, making any form with this workflow configured vulnerable, as it allows sending the message from a trusted system and address, potentially bypassing spam and email client security systems. This issue affects all (supported) versions Umbraco Forms and is patched in 13.4.2 and 15.1.2. Unpatched or unsupported versions can workaround this issue by using the `Send email with template (Razor)` workflow instead or writing a custom workflow type. To avoid accidentally using the vulnerable workflow again, the `SendEmail` workflow type can be removed using a composer available in the GitHub Security Advisory for this vulnerability.	6.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

CVE-2025-47781	2025-05-14T16:15:29.257	2025-07-11T16:11:50.470	Rallly is an open-source scheduling and collaboration tool. Versions up to and including 3.22.1 of the application features token based authentication. When a user attempts to login to the application, they insert their email and a 6 digit code is sent to their email address to complete the authentication. A token that consists of 6 digits only presents weak entropy however and when coupled with no token brute force protection, makes it possible for an unauthenticated attacker with knowledge of a valid email address to successfully brute force the token within 15 minutes (token expiration time) and take over the account associated with the targeted email address. All users on the Rallly applications are impacted. As long as an attacker knows the user's email address they used to register on the app, they can systematically take over any user account. For the authentication mechanism to be safe, the token would need to be assigned a complex high entropy value that cannot be bruteforced within reasonable time, and ideally rate limiting the /api/auth/callback/email endpoint to further make brute force attempts unreasonable within the 15 minutes time. As of time of publication, no patched versions are available.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Versions prior to 14.2.24 and 15.1.6 have a race-condition vulnerability. This issue only affects the Pages Router under certain misconfigurations, causing normal endpoints to serve `pageProps` data instead of standard HTML. This issue was patched in versions 15.1.6 and 14.2.24 by stripping the `x-now-route-matches` header from incoming requests. Applications hosted on Vercel's platform are not affected by this issue, as the platform does not cache responses based solely on `200 OK` status without explicit `cache-control` headers. Those who self-host Next.js deployments and are unable to upgrade immediately can mitigate this vulnerability by stripping the `x-now-route-matches` header from all incoming requests at the content development network and setting `cache-control: no-store` for all responses under risk. The maintainers of Next.js strongly recommend only caching responses with explicit cache-control headers.	3.7	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

Prior to versions 5.29.0, 6.21.2, and 7.5.0, applications that use undici to implement a webhook-like system are vulnerable. If the attacker set up a server with an invalid certificate, and they can force the application to call the webhook repeatedly, then they can cause a memory leak. This has been patched in versions 5.29.0, 6.21.2, and 7.5.0. As a workaound, avoid calling a webhook repeatedly if the webhook fails.	3.1	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L		
CVE-2025-47285	2025-05-15T18:15:38.177	2025-05-16T14:43:26.160	"Vyper is the Pythonic Programming Language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. In versions up to and including 0.4.2rc1, `concat()` may skip evaluation of side effects when the length of an argument is zero. This is due to a fastpath in the implementation which skips evaluation of argument expressions when their length is zero. In practice, it would be very unusual in user code to construct zero-length bytestrings using an expression with side-effects, since zero-length bytestrings are typically constructed with the empty literal `b""""`; the only way to construct an empty bytestring which has side effects would be with the ternary operator introduced in v0.3.8, e.g. `b"""" if self.do_some_side_effect() else b""""`. The fix is available in pull request 4644 and expected to be part of the 0.4.2 release. As a workaround, don't have side effects in expressions which construct zero-length bytestrings."					
CVE-2025-47774	2025-05-15T18:15:38.440	2025-05-16T14:43:26.160	Vyper is the Pythonic Programming Language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. In versions up to and including 0.4.2rc1, the `slice()` builtin can elide side effects when the output length is 0, and the source bytestring is a builtin (`msg.data` or `<address>.code`). The reason is that for these source locations, the check that `length >= 1` is skipped. The result is that a 0-length bytestring constructed with slice can be passed to `make_byte_array_copier`, which elides evaluation of its source argument when the max length is 0. The impact is that side effects in the `start` argument may be elided when the `length` argument is 0, e.g. `slice(msg.data, self.do_side_effect(), 0)`. The fix in pull request 4645 disallows any invocation of `slice()` with length 0, including for the ad hoc locations discussed in this advisory. The fix is expected to be part of version 0.4.2.

In versions on the 2.x branch prior to commit 5e6f540d249afcaeaf76ab95517d0359fde883b0, owners of Modular Accounts can grant session keys (scoped external keys) to external parties and would use the allowlist module to restrict which external contracts can be accessed by the session key. There is a bug in the allowlist module in that we don't check for the `executeUserOp` -> `execute` or `executeBatch` path, effectively allowing any session key to bypass any access control restrictions set on the session key. Session keys are able to access ERC20 and ERC721 token contracts amongst others, transferring all tokens from the account out andonfigure the permissions on external modules on session keys. They would be able to remove all restrictions set on themselves this way, or rotate the keys of other keys with higher privileges into keys that they control. Commit 5e6f540d249afcaeaf76ab95517d0359fde883b0 fixes this issue.

By exploiting the vulnerability is possible to exfiltrate `GITHUB_TOKEN` and secrets `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID`,  `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET`. In particular `GITHUB_TOKEN` which can be used to completely overtake the repo since the token has content write privileges.

net_sched: hfsc: Fix a UAF vulnerability in class with netem as child qdisc

As described in Gerrard's report [1], we have a UAF case when an hfsc class
has a netem child qdisc. The crux of the issue is that hfsc is assuming
that checking for cl->qdisc->q.qlen == 0 guarantees that it hasn't inserted
the class in the vttree or eltree (which is not true for the netem
duplicate case).

This patch checks the n_active class variable to make sure that the code
won't insert the class in the vttree or eltree twice, catering for the
reentrant case.

The issue lies within the themeeditor controller (file: /applications/core/modules/front/system/themeeditor.php), where a protected method named customCss can be invoked by unauthenticated users. This method passes the value of the content parameter to the Theme::makeProcessFunction() method; hence it is evaluated by the template engine. Accordingly, this can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code by providing crafted template strings.	10.0	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

Generally, we recommend using a dedicated model object with properties only for data binding, or using constructor binding since constructor arguments explicitly declare what to bind together with turning off setter binding through the declarativeBinding flag. See the Model Design section in the reference documentation.

For setting binding, prefer the use of allowedFields (an explicit list) over disallowedFields.

This inconsistency enables request smuggling, allowing attackers to bypass proxy-based access controls and submit unauthorized requests.

The issue was resolved by upgrading `llhttp` to version 9, which enforces correct header termination.

Impact:
* This vulnerability affects only Node.js 20.x users prior to the `llhttp` v9 upgrade."

ALSA: ump: Fix buffer overflow at UMP SysEx message conversion

The conversion function from MIDI 1.0 to UMP packet contains an
internal buffer to keep the incoming MIDI bytes, and its size is 4, as
it was supposed to be the max size for a MIDI1 UMP packet data.
However, the implementation overlooked that SysEx is handled in a
different format, and it can be up to 6 bytes, as found in
do_convert_to_ump().  It leads eventually to a buffer overflow, and
may corrupt the memory when a longer SysEx message is received.

The fix is simply to extend the buffer size to 6 to fit with the SysEx
UMP message."

CVE-2025-47934	2025-05-19T19:15:52.330	2025-05-21T20:25:16.407	OpenPGP.js is a JavaScript implementation of the OpenPGP protocol. Startinf in version 5.0.1 and prior to versions 5.11.3 and 6.1.1, a maliciously modified message can be passed to either `openpgp.verify` or `openpgp.decrypt`, causing these functions to return a valid signature verification result while returning data that was not actually signed. This flaw allows signature verifications of inline (non-detached) signed messages (using `openpgp.verify`) and signed-and-encrypted messages (using `openpgp.decrypt` with `verificationKeys`) to be spoofed, since both functions return extracted data that may not match the data that was originally signed. Detached signature verifications are not affected, as no signed data is returned in that case. In order to spoof a message, the attacker needs a single valid message signature (inline or detached) as well as the plaintext data that was legitimately signed, and can then construct an inline-signed message or signed-and-encrypted message with any data of the attacker's choice, which will appear as legitimately signed by affected versions of OpenPGP.js. In other words, any inline-signed message can be modified to return any other data (while still indicating that the signature was valid), and the same is true for signed+encrypted messages if the attacker can obtain a valid signature and encrypt a new message (of the attacker's choice) together with that signature. The issue has been patched in versions 5.11.3 and 6.1.1. Some workarounds are available. When verifying inline-signed messages, extract the message and signature(s) from the message returned by `openpgp.readMessage`, and verify the(/each) signature as a detached signature by passing the signature and a new message containing only the data (created using `openpgp.createMessage`) to `openpgp.verify`.  When decrypting and verifying signed+encrypted messages, decrypt and verify the message in two steps, by first calling `openpgp.decrypt` without `verificationKeys`, and then passing the returned signature(s) and a new message containing the decrypted data (created using `openpgp.createMessage`) to `openpgp.verify`.

Versions prior to 2.0.0 are vulnerable to a resource exhaustion and memory leak issue due to improper stream handling. When the HTTP request stream emits an error, the internal `busboy` stream is not closed, violating Node.js stream safety guidance. This leads to unclosed streams accumulating over time, consuming memory and file descriptors. Under sustained or repeated failure conditions, this can result in denial of service, requiring manual server restarts to recover. All users of Multer handling file uploads are potentially impacted. Users should upgrade to 2.0.0 to receive a patch. No known workarounds are available.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Prior to version 2.25.1, rendering `{{ attributes }}` or using any method that returns a `ComponentAttributes` instance (e.g. `only()`, `defaults()`, `without()`) ouputs attribute values directly without escaping. If these values are unsafe (e.g. contain user input), this can lead to HTML attribute injection and XSS vulnerabilities. The issue is fixed in version `2.25.1` of `symfony/ux-twig-component` Those who use `symfony/ux-live-component` must also update it to `2.25.1` to benefit from the fix, as it reuses the `ComponentAttributes` class internally. As a workaround, avoid rendering `{{ attributes }}` or derived objects directly if it may contain untrusted values.
Instead, use `{{ attributes.render('name') }}` for safe output of individual attributes."	6.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

By design, the file management module in TYPO3’s backend user interface has historically allowed the upload of any file type, with the exception of those that are directly executable in a web server context. This lack of restriction means it is possible to upload files that may be considered potentially harmful, such as executable binaries (e.g., `.exe` files), or files with inconsistent file extensions and MIME types (for example, a file incorrectly named with a `.png` extension but actually carrying the MIME type `application/zip`) starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to versions 9.5.51 ELTS, 10.4.50 ELTS, 11.5.44 ELTS, 12.4.31 LTS, and 13.4.12 LTS.

example, in Winbond SPINAND flash memory devices, the `write_cache` and

a divide error when `ncycles` is calculated in the

Add changes to skip the 'ncylcles' calculation for zero dummy bytes.

wifi: plfxlc: Remove erroneous assert in plfxlc_mac_release

plfxlc_mac_release() asserts that mac->lock is held. This assertion is
incorrect, because even if it was possible, it would not be the valid
behaviour. The function is used when probe fails or after the device is
disconnected. In both cases mac->lock can not be held as the driver is
not working with the device at the moment. All functions that use mac->lock
unlock it just after it was held. There is also no need to hold mac->lock
for plfxlc_mac_release() itself, as mac data is not affected, except for
mac->flags, which is modified atomically.

On Qualcomm chipsets not all GPIOs are wakeup capable. Those GPIOs do not

explicitly disconnect the hierarchy for those. The pinctrl-msm driver marks
these with GPIO_NO_WAKE_IRQ. qcom-pdc has a check for this, but

[CAUSE]
When btrfs_alloc_path() failed, btrfs_iget() directly returned without
releasing the inode already allocated by btrfs_iget_locked().

This results the above busy inode and trigger the kernel BUG.

[FIX]
Fix it by calling iget_failed() if btrfs_alloc_path() failed.

If we hit error inside btrfs_read_locked_inode(), it will properly call
iget_failed(), so nothing to worry about.

Although the iget_failed() cleanup inside btrfs_read_locked_inode() is a
break of the normal error handling scheme, let's fix the obvious bug
and backport first, then rework the error handling later."

causes an unbalance in device refcount, since device_find_child() calls an
implicit get_device(): this, in turns, inhibits the call of the provided
release methods upon devices destruction.

As a consequence, one of the structures that is not freed properly upon
destruction is the internal struct device_private dev->p populated by the
drivers subsystem core.

KMemleak detects this situation since loading/unloding some SCMI driver
causes related devices to be created/destroyed without calling any
device_release method.

This happens when copying the coredump segment list in
bnxt_hwrm_dbg_dma_data() with the HWRM_DBG_COREDUMP_LIST FW command.
The info->dest_buf buffer is allocated based on the number of coredump
segments returned by the FW.  The segment list is then DMA'ed by
the FW and the length of the DMA is returned by FW.  The driver then
copies this DMA'ed segment list to info->dest_buf.

In some cases, this DMA length may exceed the info->dest_buf length
and cause the above BUG condition.  Fix it by capping the copy
length to not exceed the length of info->dest_buf.  The extra
DMA data contains no useful information.

This code path is shared for the HWRM_DBG_COREDUMP_LIST and the
HWRM_DBG_COREDUMP_RETRIEVE FW commands.  The buffering is different
for these 2 FW commands.  To simplify the logic, we need to move

Bluetooth: btusb: avoid NULL pointer dereference in skb_dequeue()

A NULL pointer dereference can occur in skb_dequeue() when processing a
QCA firmware crash dump on WCN7851 (0489:e0f3).

[ 93.672166] Bluetooth: hci0: ACL memdump size(589824)

[ 93.672475] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000008
[ 93.672517] Workqueue: hci0 hci_devcd_rx [bluetooth]
[ 93.672598] RIP: 0010:skb_dequeue+0x50/0x80

The issue stems from handle_dump_pkt_qca() returning 0 even when a dump
packet is successfully processed. This is because it incorrectly
forwards the return value of hci_devcd_init() (which returns 0 on
success). As a result, the caller (btusb_recv_acl_qca() or
btusb_recv_evt_qca()) assumes the packet was not handled and passes it
to hci_recv_frame(), leading to premature kfree() of the skb.

Later, hci_devcd_rx() attempts to dequeue the same skb from the dump
queue, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference.

Fix this by:
1. Making handle_dump_pkt_qca() return 0 on success and negative errno
   on failure, consistent with kernel conventions.
2. Splitting dump packet detection into separate functions for ACL
   and event packets for better structure and readability.

This ensures dump packets are properly identified and consumed, avoiding
double handling and preventing NULL pointer access."

book3s64/radix : Align section vmemmap start address to PAGE_SIZE

A vmemmap altmap is a device-provided region used to provide
backing storage for struct pages. For each namespace, the altmap
should belong to that same namespace. If the namespaces are
created unaligned, there is a chance that the section vmemmap
start address could also be unaligned. If the section vmemmap
start address is unaligned, the altmap page allocated from the
current namespace might be used by the previous namespace also.
During the free operation, since the altmap is shared between two
namespaces, the previous namespace may detect that the page does
not belong to its altmap and incorrectly assume that the page is a
normal page. It then attempts to free the normal page, which leads
to a kernel crash.

Another issue is that if there is no altmap, a PMD-sized vmemmap
page will be allocated from RAM, regardless of the alignment of
the section start address. If the section start address is not
aligned to the PMD size, a VM_BUG_ON will be triggered when
setting the PMD-sized page to page table.

In this patch, we are aligning the section vmemmap start address
to PAGE_SIZE. After alignment, the start address will not be
part of the current namespace, and a normal page will be allocated
for the vmemmap mapping of the current section. For the remaining
sections, altmaps will be allocated. During the free operation,
the normal page will be correctly freed.

In the same way, a PMD_SIZE vmemmap page will be allocated only if
the section start address is PMD_SIZE-aligned; otherwise, it will
fall back to a PAGE-sized vmemmap allocation.

btrfs: adjust subpage bit start based on sectorsize

When running machines with 64k page size and a 16k nodesize we started
seeing tree log corruption in production.  This turned out to be because
we were not writing out dirty blocks sometimes, so this in fact affects
all metadata writes.

When writing out a subpage EB we scan the subpage bitmap for a dirty
range.  If the range isn't dirty we do

	bit_start++;

to move onto the next bit.  The problem is the bitmap is based on the
number of sectors that an EB has.  So in this case, we have a 64k
pagesize, 16k nodesize, but a 4k sectorsize.  This means our bitmap is 4
bits for every node.  With a 64k page size we end up with 4 nodes per
page.

To make this easier this is how everything looks

[0         16k       32k       48k     ] logical address
[0         4         8         12      ] radix tree offset
[               64k page               ] folio
[ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ] extent buffers
[ | | | |  | | | |   | | | |   | | | | ] bitmap

Now we use all of our addressing based on fs_info->sectorsize_bits, so
as you can see the above our 16k eb->start turns into radix entry 4.

When we find a dirty range for our eb, we correctly do bit_start +=
sectors_per_node, because if we start at bit 0, the next bit for the
next eb is 4, to correspond to eb->start 16k.

However if our range is clean, we will do bit_start++, which will now
put us offset from our radix tree entries.

In our case, assume that the first time we check the bitmap the block is
not dirty, we increment bit_start so now it == 1, and then we loop
around and check again.  This time it is dirty, and we go to find that
start using the following equation

	start = folio_start + bit_start * fs_info->sectorsize;

so in the case above, eb->start 0 is now dirty, and we calculate start
as

	0 + 1 * fs_info->sectorsize = 4096
	4096 >> 12 = 1

Now we're looking up the radix tree for 1, and we won't find an eb.
What's worse is now we're using bit_start == 1, so we do bit_start +=
sectors_per_node, which is now 5.  If that eb is dirty we will run into
the same thing, we will look at an offset that is not populated in the
radix tree, and now we're skipping the writeout of dirty extent buffers.

The best fix for this is to not use sectorsize_bits to address nodes,
but that's a larger change.  Since this is a fs corruption problem fix
it simply by always using sectors_per_node to increment the start bit."

perf/x86/intel: KVM: Mask PEBS_ENABLE loaded for guest with vCPU's value.

When generating the MSR_IA32_PEBS_ENABLE value that will be loaded on
VM-Entry to a KVM guest, mask the value with the vCPU's desired PEBS_ENABLE
value.  Consulting only the host kernel's host vs. guest masks results in
running the guest with PEBS enabled even when the guest doesn't want to use
PEBS.  Because KVM uses perf events to proxy the guest virtual PMU, simply
looking at exclude_host can't differentiate between events created by host
userspace, and events created by KVM on behalf of the guest.

Running the guest with PEBS unexpectedly enabled typically manifests as
crashes due to a near-infinite stream of #PFs.  E.g. if the guest hasn't
written MSR_IA32_DS_AREA, the CPU will hit page faults on address '0' when
trying to record PEBS events.

The issue is most easily reproduced by running `perf kvm top` from before
commit 7b100989b4f6 (""perf evlist: Remove __evlist__add_default"") (after
which, `perf kvm top` effectively stopped using PEBS).	The userspace side
of perf creates a guest-only PEBS event, which intel_guest_get_msrs()
misconstrues a guest-*owned* PEBS event.

Arguably, this is a userspace bug, as enabling PEBS on guest-only events
simply cannot work, and userspace can kill VMs in many other ways (there
is no danger to the host).  However, even if this is considered to be bad
userspace behavior, there's zero downside to perf/KVM restricting PEBS to
guest-owned events.

Note, commit 854250329c02 (""KVM: x86/pmu: Disable guest PEBS temporarily
in two rare situations"") fixed the case where host userspace is profiling
KVM *and* userspace, but missed the case where userspace is profiling only
KVM."

net: phy: allow MDIO bus PM ops to start/stop state machine for phylink-controlled PHY

DSA has 2 kinds of drivers:

1. Those who call dsa_switch_suspend() and dsa_switch_resume() from
   their device PM ops: qca8k-8xxx, bcm_sf2, microchip ksz
2. Those who don't: all others. The above methods should be optional.

For type 1, dsa_switch_suspend() calls dsa_user_suspend() -> phylink_stop(),
and dsa_switch_resume() calls dsa_user_resume() -> phylink_start().
These seem good candidates for setting mac_managed_pm = true because
that is essentially its definition [1], but that does not seem to be the
biggest problem for now, and is not what this change focuses on.

Talking strictly about the 2nd category of DSA drivers here (which
do not have MAC managed PM, meaning that for their attached PHYs,
mdio_bus_phy_suspend() and mdio_bus_phy_resume() should run in full),
I have noticed that the following warning from mdio_bus_phy_resume() is
triggered:

	WARN_ON(phydev->state != PHY_HALTED && phydev->state != PHY_READY &&
		phydev->state != PHY_UP);

because the PHY state machine is running.

It's running as a result of a previous dsa_user_open() -> ... ->
phylink_start() -> phy_start() having been initiated by the user.

The previous mdio_bus_phy_suspend() was supposed to have called
phy_stop_machine(), but it didn't. So this is why the PHY is in state
PHY_NOLINK by the time mdio_bus_phy_resume() runs.

mdio_bus_phy_suspend() did not call phy_stop_machine() because for
phylink, the phydev->adjust_link function pointer is NULL. This seems a
technicality introduced by commit fddd91016d16 (""phylib: fix PAL state
machine restart on resume""). That commit was written before phylink
existed, and was intended to avoid crashing with consumer drivers which
don't use the PHY state machine - phylink always does, when using a PHY.
But phylink itself has historically not been developed with
suspend/resume in mind, and apparently not tested too much in that
scenario, allowing this bug to exist unnoticed for so long. Plus, prior
to the WARN_ON(), it would have likely been invisible.

This issue is not in fact restricted to type 2 DSA drivers (according to
the above ad-hoc classification), but can be extrapolated to any MAC
driver with phylink and MDIO-bus-managed PHY PM ops. DSA is just where
the issue was reported. Assuming mac_managed_pm is set correctly, a
quick search indicates the following other drivers might be affected:

$ grep -Zlr PHYLINK_NETDEV drivers/ | xargs -0 grep -L mac_managed_pm

Make the existing conditions dependent on the PHY device having a
phydev->phy_link_change() implementation equal to the default
phy_link_change() provided by phylib. Otherwise, we implicitly know that
the phydev has the phylink-provided phylink_phy_change() callback, and
when phylink is used, the PHY state machine always needs to be stopped/
started on the suspend/resume path. The code is structured as such that
if phydev->phy_link_change() is absent, it is a matter of time until the
kernel will crash - no need to further complicate the test.

When a CL/CSD job times out, we check if the GPU has made any progress

the reset and let the timer get rearmed. This gives long-running jobs a
chance to complete.

However, when `timedout_job()` is called, the job in question is removed
from the pending list, which means it won't be automatically freed through
`free_job()`. Consequently, when we skip the reset and keep the job
running, the job won't be freed when it finally completes.

This situation leads to a memory leak, as exposed in [1] and [2].

Architecturally, INIT is blocked when the CPU is in SMM, hence KVM's WARN()
in kvm_vcpu_reset() to guard against KVM bugs, e.g. to detect improper
emulation of INIT.  SHUTDOWN on SVM is a weird edge case where KVM needs to
do _something_ sane with the VMCB, since it's technically undefined, and
INIT is the least awful choice given KVM's ABI.

So, double down on stuffing INIT on SHUTDOWN, and force the vCPU out of
SMM to avoid any weirdness (and the WARN).

check the PMD migration entry and return early.  In this context, there is

bpf: Scrub packet on bpf_redirect_peer

When bpf_redirect_peer is used to redirect packets to a device in
another network namespace, the skb isn't scrubbed. That can lead skb
information from one namespace to be ""misused"" in another namespace.

As one example, this is causing Cilium to drop traffic when using
bpf_redirect_peer to redirect packets that just went through IPsec
decryption to a container namespace. The following pwru trace shows (1)
the packet path from the host's XFRM layer to the container's XFRM
layer where it's dropped and (2) the number of active skb extensions at
each function.

In this case, there are no XFRM policies in the container's network
namespace so the drop is unexpected. When we decrypt the IPsec packet,
the XFRM state used for decryption is set in the skb extensions. This
information is preserved across the netns switch. When we reach the
XFRM policy check in the container's netns, __xfrm_policy_check drops
the packet with LINUX_MIB_XFRMINNOPOLS because a (container-side) XFRM
policy can't be found that matches the (host-side) XFRM state used for
decryption.

This patch fixes this by scrubbing the packet when using
bpf_redirect_peer, as is done on typical netns switches via veth
devices except skb->mark and skb->tstamp are not zeroed."

x86/mm: Eliminate window where TLB flushes may be inadvertently skipped

tl;dr: There is a window in the mm switching code where the new CR3 is
set and the CPU should be getting TLB flushes for the new mm.  But
should_flush_tlb() has a bug and suppresses the flush.  Fix it by
widening the window where should_flush_tlb() sends an IPI.

Long Version:

=== History ===

There were a few things leading up to this.

First, updating mm_cpumask() was observed to be too expensive, so it was
made lazier.  But being lazy caused too many unnecessary IPIs to CPUs
due to the now-lazy mm_cpumask().  So code was added to cull
mm_cpumask() periodically[2].  But that culling was a bit too aggressive
and skipped sending TLB flushes to CPUs that need them.  So here we are
again.

=== Problem ===

The too-aggressive code in should_flush_tlb() strikes in this window:

	// Turn on IPIs for this CPU/mm combination, but only
	// if should_flush_tlb() agrees:
	cpumask_set_cpu(cpu, mm_cpumask(next));

	next_tlb_gen = atomic64_read(&next->context.tlb_gen);
	choose_new_asid(next, next_tlb_gen, &new_asid, &need_flush);
	load_new_mm_cr3(need_flush);
	// ^ After 'need_flush' is set to false, IPIs *MUST*
	// be sent to this CPU and not be ignored.

        this_cpu_write(cpu_tlbstate.loaded_mm, next);
	// ^ Not until this point does should_flush_tlb()
	// become true!

should_flush_tlb() will suppress TLB flushes between load_new_mm_cr3()
and writing to 'loaded_mm', which is a window where they should not be
suppressed.  Whoops.

=== Solution ===

Thankfully, the fuzzy ""just about to write CR3"" window is already marked
with loaded_mm==LOADED_MM_SWITCHING.  Simply checking for that state in
should_flush_tlb() is sufficient to ensure that the CPU is targeted with
an IPI.

This will cause more TLB flush IPIs.  But the window is relatively small
and I do not expect this to cause any kind of measurable performance
impact.

Update the comment where LOADED_MM_SWITCHING is written since it grew
yet another user.

Peter Z also raised a concern that should_flush_tlb() might not observe
'loaded_mm' and 'is_lazy' in the same order that switch_mm_irqs_off()
writes them.  Add a barrier to ensure that they are observed in the
order they are written."

pds_core: Prevent possible adminq overflow/stuck condition

The pds_core's adminq is protected by the adminq_lock, which prevents
more than 1 command to be posted onto it at any one time. This makes it
so the client drivers cannot simultaneously post adminq commands.
However, the completions happen in a different context, which means
multiple adminq commands can be posted sequentially and all waiting
on completion.

On the FW side, the backing adminq request queue is only 16 entries
long and the retry mechanism and/or overflow/stuck prevention is
lacking. This can cause the adminq to get stuck, so commands are no
longer processed and completions are no longer sent by the FW.

As an initial fix, prevent more than 16 outstanding adminq commands so
there's no way to cause the adminq from getting stuck. This works
because the backing adminq request queue will never have more than 16
pending adminq commands, so it will never overflow. This is done by
reducing the adminq depth to 16."					
CVE-2025-37988	2025-05-20T18:15:45.673	2025-05-21T20:24:58.133	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fix a couple of races in MNT_TREE_BENEATH handling by do_move_mount()

Normally do_lock_mount(path, _) is locking a mountpoint pinned by
*path and at the time when matching unlock_mount() unlocks that
location it is still pinned by the same thing.

Unfortunately, for 'beneath' case it's no longer that simple -
the object being locked is not the one *path points to.  It's the
mountpoint of path->mnt.  The thing is, without sufficient locking
->mnt_parent may change under us and none of the locks are held
at that point.  The rules are
	* mount_lock stabilizes m->mnt_parent for any mount m.
	* namespace_sem stabilizes m->mnt_parent, provided that
m is mounted.
	* if either of the above holds and refcount of m is positive,
we are guaranteed the same for refcount of m->mnt_parent.

namespace_sem nests inside inode_lock(), so do_lock_mount() has
to take inode_lock() before grabbing namespace_sem.  It does
recheck that path->mnt is still mounted in the same place after
getting namespace_sem, and it does take care to pin the dentry.
It is needed, since otherwise we might end up with racing mount --move
(or umount) happening while we were getting locks; in that case
dentry would no longer be a mountpoint and could've been evicted
on memory pressure along with its inode - not something you want
when grabbing lock on that inode.

However, pinning a dentry is not enough - the matching mount is
also pinned only by the fact that path->mnt is mounted on top it
and at that point we are not holding any locks whatsoever, so
the same kind of races could end up with all references to
that mount gone just as we are about to enter inode_lock().
If that happens, we are left with filesystem being shut down while
we are holding a dentry reference on it; results are not pretty.

What we need to do is grab both dentry and mount at the same time;
that makes inode_lock() safe *and* avoids the problem with fs getting
shut down under us.  After taking namespace_sem we verify that
path->mnt is still mounted (which stabilizes its ->mnt_parent) and
check that it's still mounted at the same place.  From that point
on to the matching namespace_unlock() we are guaranteed that
mount/dentry pair we'd grabbed are also pinned by being the mountpoint
of path->mnt, so we can quietly drop both the dentry reference (as
the current code does) and mnt one - it's OK to do under namespace_sem,
since we are not dropping the final refs.

That solves the problem on do_lock_mount() side; unlock_mount()
also has one, since dentry is guaranteed to stay pinned only until
the namespace_unlock().  That's easy to fix - just have inode_unlock()
done earlier, while it's still pinned by mp->m_dentry."

net: phy: leds: fix memory leak

A network restart test on a router led to an out-of-memory condition,
which was traced to a memory leak in the PHY LED trigger code.

The root cause is misuse of the devm API. The registration function
(phy_led_triggers_register) is called from phy_attach_direct, not
phy_probe, and the unregister function (phy_led_triggers_unregister)
is called from phy_detach, not phy_remove. This means the register and
unregister functions can be called multiple times for the same PHY
device, but devm-allocated memory is not freed until the driver is
unbound.

This also prevents kmemleak from detecting the leak, as the devm API
internally stores the allocated pointer.

Fix this by replacing devm_kzalloc/devm_kcalloc with standard
kzalloc/kcalloc, and add the corresponding kfree calls in the unregister
path."

parisc: Fix double SIGFPE crash

Camm noticed that on parisc a SIGFPE exception will crash an application with
a second SIGFPE in the signal handler.  Dave analyzed it, and it happens
because glibc uses a double-word floating-point store to atomically update
function descriptors. As a result of lazy binding, we hit a floating-point
store in fpe_func almost immediately.

When the T bit is set, an assist exception trap occurs when when the
co-processor encounters *any* floating-point instruction except for a double
store of register %fr0.  The latter cancels all pending traps.  Let's fix this
by clearing the Trap (T) bit in the FP status register before returning to the
signal handler in userspace.

No other configurations are affected. vLLM supports the use of the `PyNcclPipe` class to establish a peer-to-peer communication domain for data transmission between distributed nodes. The GPU-side KV-Cache transmission is implemented through the `PyNcclCommunicator` class, while CPU-side control message passing is handled via the `send_obj` and `recv_obj` methods on the CPU side.​ The intention was that this interface should only be exposed to a private network using the IP address specified by the `--kv-ip` CLI parameter. The vLLM documentation covers how this must be limited to a secured network. The default and intentional behavior from PyTorch is that the `TCPStore` interface listens on ALL interfaces, regardless of what IP address is provided. The IP address given was only used as a client-side address to use. vLLM was fixed to use a workaround to force the `TCPStore` instance to bind its socket to a specified private interface. As of version 0.8.5, vLLM limits the `TCPStore` socket to the private interface as configured.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2025-48063	2025-05-21T18:15:53.200	2025-06-20T17:38:28.517	XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In XWiki 16.10.0, required rights were introduced as a way to limit which rights a document can have. Part of the security model of required rights is that a user who doesn't have a right also cannot define that right as required right. That way, users who are editing documents on which required rights are enforced can be sure that they're not giving a right to a script or object that it didn't have before. A bug in the implementation of the enforcement of this rule means that in fact, it was possible for any user with edit right on a document to set programming right as required right. If then a user with programming right edited that document, the content of that document would gain programming right, allowing remote code execution. This thereby defeats most of the security benefits of required rights. As XWiki still performs the required rights analysis when a user edits a page even when required rights are enforced, the user with programming right would still be warned about the dangerous content unless the attacker managed to bypass this check. Note also that none of the affected versions include a UI for enabling the enforcing of required rights so it seems unlikely that anybody relied on them for security in the affected versions. As this vulnerability provides no additional attack surface unless all documents in the wiki enforce required rights, we consider the impact of this attack to be low even though gaining programming right could have a high impact. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 16.10.4 and 17.1.0RC1. No known workarounds are available except for upgrading.	8.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2025-48064	2025-05-21T18:15:53.383	2025-05-21T20:24:58.133	GitHub Desktop is an open-source, Electron-based GitHub app designed for git development. Prior to version 3.4.20-beta3, an attacker convincing a user to view a file in a commit of their making in the history view can cause information disclosure by means of Git attempting to access a network share. This affects GitHub Desktop users on Windows that view malicious commits in the history view. macOS users are not affected. When viewing a file diff in the history view GitHub Desktop will call `git log` or `git diff` with the object id (SHA) of the commit, the name of the file, and the old name of the file if the file has been renamed. As a security precaution Git will attempt to fully resolve the old and new path via `realpath`, traversing symlinks, to ensure that the resolved paths reside within the repository working directory. This can lead to Git attempting to access a path that resides on a network share (UNC path) and in doing so Windows will attempt to perform NTLM authentication which passes information such as the computer name, the currently signed in (Windows) user name, and an NTLM hash. GitHub Desktop 3.4.20 and later fix this vulnerability. The beta channel includes the fix in 3.4.20-beta3. As a workaround to use until upgrading is possible, only browse commits in the history view that comes from trusted sources.	3.3	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

Prior to version 2.0.8, the `ejson2env` tool has a vulnerability related to how it writes to `stdout`. Specifically, the tool is intended to write an export statement for environment variables and their values. However, due to inadequate output sanitization, there is a potential risk where variable names or values may include malicious content, resulting in additional unintended commands being output to `stdout`. If this output is improperly utilized in further command execution, it could lead to command injection, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host system. Version 2.0.8 sanitizes output during decryption. Other mitigations involve avoiding use of `ejson2env` to decrypt untrusted user secrets and/or avoiding evaluating or executing the direct output from `ejson2env` without removing nonprintable characters.	6.6	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVE-2025-47942	2025-05-21T22:15:50.817	2025-05-23T15:55:02.040	The Open edX Platform is a learning management platform. Prior to commit 6740e75c0fdc7ba095baf88e9f5e4f3e15cfd8ba, edxapp has no built-in protection against downloading the python_lib.zip asset from courses, which is a concern since it often contains custom grading code or answers to course problems. This potentially affects any course using custom Python-graded problem blocks. The openedx/configuration repo has had a patch since 2016 in the form of an nginx rule, but this was only intended as a temporary mitigation. As the configuration repo has been deprecated and we have not been able to locate any similar protection in Tutor, it is likely that most deployments have no protection against python_lib.zip being downloaded. The recommended mitigation, implemented in commit 6740e75c0fdc7ba095baf88e9f5e4f3e15cfd8ba, restricts python_lib.zip downloads to just the course team and site staff/superusers.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

a trusted use instead of a rejected use for a certificate.

Impact summary: If a user intends to make a trusted certificate rejected for
a particular use it will be instead marked as trusted for that use.

A copy & paste error during minor refactoring of the code introduced this
issue in the OpenSSL 3.5 version. If, for example, a trusted CA certificate
should be trusted only for the purpose of authenticating TLS servers but not
for CMS signature verification and the CMS signature verification is intended
to be marked as rejected with the -addreject option, the resulting CA
certificate will be trusted for CMS signature verification purpose instead.

Only users which use the trusted certificate format who use the openssl x509
command line application to add rejected uses are affected by this issue.
The issues affecting only the command line application are considered to
be Low severity.

The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this

A special BeanIntrospector class was added in version 1.9.2. This can be used to stop attackers from using the declared class property of Java enum objects to get access to the classloader. However this protection was not enabled by default. PropertyUtilsBean (and consequently BeanUtilsBean) now disallows declared class level property access by default.





Releases 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 address a potential security issue when accessing enum properties in an uncontrolled way. If an application using Commons BeanUtils passes property paths from an external source directly to the getProperty() method of PropertyUtilsBean, an attacker can access the enum’s class loader via the “declaredClass” property available on all Java “enum” objects. Accessing the enum’s “declaredClass” allows remote attackers to access the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code. The same issue exists with PropertyUtilsBean.getNestedProperty().
Starting in versions 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 a special BeanIntrospector suppresses the “declaredClass” property. Note that this new BeanIntrospector is enabled by default, but you can disable it to regain the old behavior; see section 2.5 of the user's guide and the unit tests.

This issue affects Apache Commons BeanUtils 1.x before 1.11.0, and 2.x before 2.0.0-M2.Users of the artifact commons-beanutils:commons-beanutils

This exposure could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including database credentials, API keys, and other critical system configurations.

Sensitive Information Disclosure via .env File Exposure: The .env file, which typically contains environment variables and sensitive application configurations, is directly accessible via a web browser due to missing web server configurations that restrict access to such files. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to view the contents of this file by simply navigating to its URL.

MitigationUpdate Mautic to the latest Mautic version.

By default, Mautic does not use .env files for production data.

For Apache users: Ensure your web server is configured to respect .htaccess files.

For Nginx users: As Nginx does not inherently support .htaccess files, you must manually add a configuration block to your Nginx server configuration to deny access to .env files. Add the following to your Nginx configuration for the Mautic site:

location ~ /\.env {
    deny all;
}





After modifying your Nginx configuration, remember to reload or restart your Nginx service for the changes to take effect."	5.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L

fs/erofs/fileio: call erofs_onlinefolio_split() after bio_add_folio()

If bio_add_folio() fails (because it is full),
erofs_fileio_scan_folio() needs to submit the I/O request via
erofs_fileio_rq_submit() and allocate a new I/O request with an empty
`struct bio`.  Then it retries the bio_add_folio() call.

However, at this point, erofs_onlinefolio_split() has already been
called which increments `folio->private`; the retry will call
erofs_onlinefolio_split() again, but there will never be a matching
erofs_onlinefolio_end() call.  This leaves the folio locked forever
and all waiters will be stuck in folio_wait_bit_common().

This bug has been added by commit ce63cb62d794 (""erofs: support
unencoded inodes for fileio""), but was practically unreachable because
there was room for 256 folios in the `struct bio` - until commit
9f74ae8c9ac9 (""erofs: shorten bvecs[] for file-backed mounts"") which
reduced the array capacity to 16 folios.

It was now trivial to trigger the bug by manually invoking readahead
from userspace, e.g.:

 posix_fadvise(fd, 0, st.st_size, POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED);

This should be fixed by invoking erofs_onlinefolio_split() only after
bio_add_folio() has succeeded.  This is safe: asynchronous completions
invoking erofs_onlinefolio_end() will not unlock the folio because
erofs_fileio_scan_folio() is still holding a reference to be released
by erofs_onlinefolio_end() at the end."

In versions starting from 0.7.0 to before 0.9.0, in the file vllm/multimodal/hasher.py, the MultiModalHasher class has a security and data integrity issue in its image hashing method. Currently, it serializes PIL.Image.Image objects using only obj.tobytes(), which returns only the raw pixel data, without including metadata such as the image’s shape (width, height, mode). As a result, two images of different sizes (e.g., 30x100 and 100x30) with the same pixel byte sequence could generate the same hash value. This may lead to hash collisions, incorrect cache hits, and even data leakage or security risks.

Prior to version 2.13.0, a validation bypass vulnerability was discovered where multiple validations defined for the same attribute could be silently overridden. Due to how the framework merged validation rules across multiple contexts (such as index, store, and update actions), malicious actors could exploit this behavior by crafting requests that bypass expected validation rules, potentially injecting unexpected or dangerous parameters into the application. This could lead to unauthorized data being accepted or processed by the API, depending on the context in which the validation was bypassed. This issue has been patched in version 2.13.0.

CVE-2025-48865	2025-05-30T07:15:23.940	2025-06-04T19:54:41.613	Fabio is an HTTP(S) and TCP router for deploying applications managed by consul. Prior to version 1.6.6, Fabio allows clients to remove X-Forwarded headers (except X-Forwarded-For) due to a vulnerability in how it processes hop-by-hop headers. Fabio adds HTTP headers like X-Forwarded-Host and X-Forwarded-Port when routing requests to backend applications. Since the receiving application should trust these headers, allowing HTTP clients to remove or modify them creates potential security vulnerabilities. Some of these custom headers can be removed and, in certain cases, manipulated. The attack relies on the behavior that headers can be defined as hop-by-hop via the HTTP Connection header. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.6.	9.1	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

CVE-2025-48936	2025-05-30T07:15:24.427	2025-06-04T18:31:41.773	Zitadel is open-source identity infrastructure software. Prior to versions 2.70.12, 2.71.10, and 3.2.2, a potential vulnerability exists in the password reset mechanism. ZITADEL utilizes the Forwarded or X-Forwarded-Host header from incoming requests to construct the URL for the password reset confirmation link. This link, containing a secret code, is then emailed to the user. If an attacker can manipulate these headers (e.g., via host header injection), they could cause ZITADEL to generate a password reset link pointing to a malicious domain controlled by the attacker. If the user clicks this manipulated link in the email, the secret reset code embedded in the URL can be captured by the attacker. This captured code could then be used to reset the user's password and gain unauthorized access to their account. This specific attack vector is mitigated for accounts that have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Passwordless authentication enabled. This issue has been patched in versions 2.70.12, 2.71.10, and 3.2.2.	8.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

When handling a crash, the function `_check_global_pid_and_forward`, which detects if the crashing process resided in a container, was being called before `consistency_checks`, which attempts to detect if the crashing process had been replaced. Because of this, if a process crashed and was quickly replaced with a containerized one, apport could be made to forward the core dump to the container, potentially leaking sensitive information. `consistency_checks` is now being called before `_check_global_pid_and_forward`. Additionally, given that the PID-reuse race condition cannot be reliably detected from userspace alone, crashes are only forwarded to containers if the kernel provided a pidfd, or if the crashing process was unprivileged (i.e., if dump mode == 1)."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
