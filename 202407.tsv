CVE-2024-24749	2024-07-01T14:15:05.350	2024-12-18T22:08:46.760	GeoServer is an open source server that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. Prior to versions 2.23.5 and 2.24.3, if GeoServer is deployed in the Windows operating system using an Apache Tomcat web application server, it is possible to bypass existing input validation in the GeoWebCache ByteStreamController class and read arbitrary classpath resources with specific file name extensions. If GeoServer is also deployed as a web archive using the data directory embedded in the `geoserver.war` file (rather than an external data directory), it will likely be possible to read specific resources to gain administrator privileges. However, it is very unlikely that production environments will be using the embedded data directory since, depending on how GeoServer is deployed, it will be erased and re-installed (which would also reset to the default password) either every time the server restarts or every time a new GeoServer WAR is installed and is therefore difficult to maintain. An external data directory will always be used if GeoServer is running in standalone mode (via an installer or a binary). Versions 2.23.5 and 2.24.3 contain a patch for the issue. Some workarounds are available. One may change from a Windows environment to a Linux environment; or change from Apache Tomcat to Jetty application server. One may also disable anonymous access to the embeded GeoWebCache administration and status pages.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVE-2024-34696	2024-07-01T15:15:16.907	2024-11-21T09:19:13.003	"GeoServer is an open source server that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. Starting in version 2.10.0 and prior to versions 2.24.4 and 2.25.1, GeoServer's Server Status page and REST API lists all environment variables and Java properties to any GeoServer user with administrative rights as part of those modules' status message. These variables/properties can also contain sensitive information, such as database passwords or API keys/tokens. Additionally, many community-developed GeoServer container images `export` other credentials from their start-up scripts as environment variables to the GeoServer (`java`) process. The precise scope of the issue depends on which container image is used and how it is configured.

The `about status` API endpoint which powers the Server Status page is only available to administrators.Depending on the operating environment, administrators might have legitimate access to credentials in other ways, but this issue defeats more sophisticated controls (like break-glass access to secrets or role accounts).By default, GeoServer only allows same-origin authenticated API access. This limits the scope for a third-party attacker to use an administrator’s credentials to gain access to credentials. The researchers who found the vulnerability were unable to determine any other conditions under which the GeoServer REST API may be available more broadly.

Users should update container images to use GeoServer 2.24.4 or 2.25.1 to get the bug fix. As a workaround, leave environment variables and Java system properties hidden by default. Those who provide the option to re-enable it should communicate the impact and risks so that users can make an informed choice."	4.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

Prior to versions 2.22.6, 2.23.6, 2.24.4, and 2.25.2, multiple OGC request parameters allow Remote Code Execution (RCE) by unauthenticated users through specially crafted input against a default GeoServer installation due to unsafely evaluating property names as XPath expressions.

The GeoTools library API that GeoServer calls evaluates property/attribute names for feature types in a way that unsafely passes them to the commons-jxpath library which can execute arbitrary code when evaluating XPath expressions. This XPath evaluation is intended to be used only by complex feature types (i.e., Application Schema data stores) but is incorrectly being applied to simple feature types as well which makes this vulnerability apply to **ALL** GeoServer instances. No public PoC is provided but this vulnerability has been confirmed to be exploitable through WFS GetFeature, WFS GetPropertyValue, WMS GetMap, WMS GetFeatureInfo, WMS GetLegendGraphic and WPS Execute requests. This vulnerability can lead to executing arbitrary code.

Versions 2.22.6, 2.23.6, 2.24.4, and 2.25.2 contain a patch for the issue. A workaround exists by removing the `gt-complex-x.y.jar` file from the GeoServer where `x.y` is the GeoTools version (e.g., `gt-complex-31.1.jar` if running GeoServer 2.25.1). This will remove the vulnerable code from GeoServer but may break some GeoServer functionality or prevent GeoServer from deploying if the gt-complex module is needed."	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

This vulnerability allows users to supply their own session_id value, resulting in the creation of a session with that key. If a website relies on the mere presence of a session for security purposes, this can lead to significant security risks, including unauthorized access and session fixation attacks. All users utilizing GoFiber's session middleware in the affected versions are impacted. The issue has been addressed in version 2.52.5. Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to version 2.52.5 or higher to mitigate this vulnerability. Users who are unable to upgrade immediately can apply the following workarounds to reduce the risk: Either implement additional validation to ensure session IDs are not supplied by the user and are securely generated by the server, or regularly rotate session IDs and enforce strict session expiration policies.	10.0	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

Note that this vulnerability has been fixed in the open as the effect would be immediately apparent if it was configured. Memory allocated for holding attribute values is freed after configuration was parsed. During request processing Envoy will attempt to copy content of de-allocated memory into request cookie header. This can lead to arbitrary content of Envoy's memory to be sent to the upstream service or abnormal process termination.

CVE-2024-36404	2024-07-02T14:15:13.450	2024-11-21T09:22:06.500	GeoTools is an open source Java library that provides tools for geospatial data. Prior to versions 31.2, 30.4, and 29.6, Remote Code Execution (RCE) is possible if an application uses certain GeoTools functionality to evaluate XPath expressions supplied by user input. Versions 31.2, 30.4, and 29.6 contain a fix for this issue. As a workaround, GeoTools can operate with reduced functionality by removing the `gt-complex` jar from one's application. As an example of the impact, application schema `datastore` would not function without the ability to use XPath expressions to query complex content. Alternatively, one may utilize a drop-in replacement GeoTools jar from SourceForge for versions 31.1, 30.3, 30.2, 29.2, 28.2, 27.5, 27.4, 26.7, 26.4, 25.2, and 24.0. These jars are for download only and are not available from maven central, intended to quickly provide a fix to affected applications.	9.8	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2024-38519	2024-07-02T14:15:13.737	2024-11-21T09:26:09.370	"`yt-dlp` and `youtube-dl` are command-line audio/video downloaders. Prior to the fixed versions, `yt-dlp` and `youtube-dl` do not limit the extensions of downloaded files, which could lead to arbitrary filenames being created in the download folder (and path traversal on Windows). Since `yt-dlp` and `youtube-dl` also read config from the working directory (and on Windows executables will be executed from the `yt-dlp` or `youtube-dl` directory), this could lead to arbitrary code being executed.




`yt-dlp` version 2024.07.01 fixes this issue by whitelisting the allowed extensions. `youtube-dl` fixes this issue in commit `d42a222` on the `master` branch and in nightly builds tagged 2024-07-03 or later. This might mean some very uncommon extensions might not get downloaded, however it will also limit the possible exploitation surface. In addition to upgrading, have `.%(ext)s` at the end of the output template and make sure the user trusts the websites that they are downloading from. Also, make sure to never download to a directory within PATH or other sensitive locations like one's user directory, `system32`, or other binaries locations.

CVE-2024-39315	2024-07-02T20:15:06.110	2025-04-11T14:47:52.863	Pomerium is an identity and context-aware access proxy. Prior to version 0.26.1, the Pomerium user info page (at `/.pomerium`) unintentionally included serialized OAuth2 access and ID tokens from the logged-in user's session. These tokens are not intended to be exposed to end users. This issue may be more severe in the presence of a cross-site scripting vulnerability in an upstream application proxied through Pomerium. If an attacker could insert a malicious script onto a web page proxied through Pomerium, that script could access these tokens by making a request to the `/.pomerium` endpoint. Upstream applications that authenticate only the ID token may be vulnerable to user impersonation using a token obtained in this manner. Note that an OAuth2 access token or ID token by itself is not sufficient to hijack a user's Pomerium session. Upstream applications should not be vulnerable to user impersonation via these tokens provided the application verifies the Pomerium JWT for each request, the connection between Pomerium and the application is secured by mTLS, or the connection between Pomerium and the application is otherwise secured at the network layer. The issue is patched in Pomerium v0.26.1. No known workarounds are available.	5.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

`/admin/projects/{projectname}/skills/{skillname}/video` (and probably others) is open to a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. Due to the endpoint being CSRFable e.g POST request, supports a content type that can be exploited (multipart file upload), makes a state change and has no CSRF mitigations in place (samesite flag, CSRF token). It is possible to perform a CSRF attack against a logged in admin account, allowing an attacker that can target a logged in admin of Skills Service to modify the videos, captions, and text of the skill.

CVE-2024-31223	2024-07-03T18:15:05.097	2025-09-04T14:07:17.867	Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform, and `SERVER_SIDE_FIDES_API_URL` is a server-side configuration environment variable used by the Fides Privacy Center to communicate with the Fides webserver backend. The value of this variable is a URL which typically includes a private IP address, private domain name, and/or port. A vulnerability present starting in version 2.19.0 and prior to version 2.39.2rc0 allows an unauthenticated attacker to make a HTTP GET request from the Privacy Center that discloses the value of this server-side URL. This could result in disclosure of server-side configuration giving an attacker information on server-side ports, private IP addresses, and/or private domain names. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version 2.39.2rc0. No known workarounds are available.	5.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

md/raid5: fix deadlock that raid5d() wait for itself to clear MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING

Xiao reported that lvm2 test lvconvert-raid-takeover.sh can hang with
small possibility, the root cause is exactly the same as commit
bed9e27baf52 (""Revert ""md/raid5: Wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING in raid5d"""")

However, Dan reported another hang after that, and junxiao investigated
the problem and found out that this is caused by plugged bio can't issue
from raid5d().

Current implementation in raid5d() has a weird dependence:

1) md_check_recovery() from raid5d() must hold 'reconfig_mutex' to clear
   MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING;
2) raid5d() handles IO in a deadloop, until all IO are issued;
3) IO from raid5d() must wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING to be cleared;

This behaviour is introduce before v2.6, and for consequence, if other
context hold 'reconfig_mutex', and md_check_recovery() can't update
super_block, then raid5d() will waste one cpu 100% by the deadloop, until
'reconfig_mutex' is released.

Refer to the implementation from raid1 and raid10, fix this problem by
skipping issue IO if MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING is still set after
md_check_recovery(), daemon thread will be woken up when 'reconfig_mutex'
is released. Meanwhile, the hang problem will be fixed as well."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Check for that and do not call vma_add_reservation() if that is the case,

paths, which both release either drvdata or hwmon and either can be
released before the other. These code paths (for device unbind) are as
follows (see also the bug referenced below):

This means that in i915, if use devm, we cannot gurantee that hwmon will
always be released before drvdata. Which means that we have a uaf if hwmon
sysfs is accessed when drvdata has been released but hwmon hasn't.

The only way out of this seems to be do get rid of devm_ and release/free
everything explicitly during device unbind.

kdb: Fix buffer overflow during tab-complete

Currently, when the user attempts symbol completion with the Tab key, kdb
will use strncpy() to insert the completed symbol into the command buffer.
Unfortunately it passes the size of the source buffer rather than the
destination to strncpy() with predictably horrible results. Most obviously
if the command buffer is already full but cp, the cursor position, is in
the middle of the buffer, then we will write past the end of the supplied
buffer.

Fix this by replacing the dubious strncpy() calls with memmove()/memcpy()

btree_iter is used in two ways: either allocated on the stack with a

specific cache set. Previously, the struct had a fixed-length array of
size MAX_BSETS which was indexed out-of-bounds for the dynamically-sized
iterators, which causes UBSAN to complain.

KVM: SVM: WARN on vNMI + NMI window iff NMIs are outright masked

When requesting an NMI window, WARN on vNMI support being enabled if and
only if NMIs are actually masked, i.e. if the vCPU is already handling an
NMI.  KVM's ABI for NMIs that arrive simultanesouly (from KVM's point of
view) is to inject one NMI and pend the other.  When using vNMI, KVM pends
the second NMI simply by setting V_NMI_PENDING, and lets the CPU do the
rest (hardware automatically sets V_NMI_BLOCKING when an NMI is injected).

However, if KVM can't immediately inject an NMI, e.g. because the vCPU is
in an STI shadow or is running with GIF=0, then KVM will request an NMI
window and trigger the WARN (but still function correctly).

Whether or not the GIF=0 case makes sense is debatable, as the intent of
KVM's behavior is to provide functionality that is as close to real
hardware as possible.  E.g. if two NMIs are sent in quick succession, the
probability of both NMIs arriving in an STI shadow is infinitesimally low
on real hardware, but significantly larger in a virtual environment, e.g.
if the vCPU is preempted in the STI shadow.  For GIF=0, the argument isn't
as clear cut, because the window where two NMIs can collide is much larger
in bare metal (though still small).

That said, KVM should not have divergent behavior for the GIF=0 case based
on whether or not vNMI support is enabled.  And KVM has allowed
simultaneous NMIs with GIF=0 for over a decade, since commit 7460fb4a3400
(""KVM: Fix simultaneous NMIs"").  I.e. KVM's GIF=0 handling shouldn't be
modified without a *really* good reason to do so, and if KVM's behavior
were to be modified, it should be done irrespective of vNMI support."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-39687	2024-07-05T18:15:32.663	2024-11-21T09:28:13.397	Fedify is a TypeScript library for building federated server apps powered by ActivityPub and other standards. At present, when Fedify needs to retrieve an object or activity from a remote activitypub server, it makes a HTTP request to the `@id` or other resources present within the activity it has received from the web. This activity could reference an `@id` that points to an internal IP address, allowing an attacker to send request to resources internal to the fedify server's network. This applies to not just resolution of documents containing activities or objects, but also to media URLs as well. Specifically this is a Server Side Request Forgery attack. Users should upgrade to Fedify version 0.9.2, 0.10.1, or 0.11.1 to receive a patch for this issue.	7.2	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:L

The fix for GHSA-wm4w-7h2q-3pf7 / CVE-2024-32000 included in matrix-appservice-irc 2.0.0 relied on the Matrix homeserver-provided timestamp to determine whether a user has access to the event they're replying to when determining whether or not to include a truncated version of the original event in the IRC message. Since this value is controlled by external entities, a malicious Matrix homeserver joined to a room in which a matrix-appservice-irc bridge instance (before version 2.0.1) is present can fabricate the timestamp with the intent of tricking the bridge into leaking room messages the homeserver should not have access to. matrix-appservice-irc 2.0.1 drops the reliance on `origin_server_ts` when determining whether or not an event should be visible to a user, instead tracking the event timestamps internally. As a workaround, it's possible to limit the amount of information leaked by setting a reply template that doesn't contain the original message.	4.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

CVE-2024-39486	2024-07-06T10:15:03.393	2024-11-21T09:27:47.623	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/drm_file: Fix pid refcounting race

<maarten.lankhorst@linux.intel.com>, Maxime Ripard
<mripard@kernel.org>, Thomas Zimmermann <tzimmermann@suse.de>

filp->pid is supposed to be a refcounted pointer; however, before this
patch, drm_file_update_pid() only increments the refcount of a struct
pid after storing a pointer to it in filp->pid and dropping the
dev->filelist_mutex, making the following race possible:

process A               process B
=========               =========
                        begin drm_file_update_pid
                        mutex_lock(&dev->filelist_mutex)
                        rcu_replace_pointer(filp->pid, <pid B>, 1)
                        mutex_unlock(&dev->filelist_mutex)
begin drm_file_update_pid
mutex_lock(&dev->filelist_mutex)
rcu_replace_pointer(filp->pid, <pid A>, 1)
mutex_unlock(&dev->filelist_mutex)
get_pid(<pid A>)
synchronize_rcu()
put_pid(<pid B>)   *** pid B reaches refcount 0 and is freed here ***
                        get_pid(<pid B>)   *** UAF ***
                        synchronize_rcu()
                        put_pid(<pid A>)

As far as I know, this race can only occur with CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU=y
because it requires RCU to detect a quiescent state in code that is not
explicitly calling into the scheduler.

This race leads to use-after-free of a ""struct pid"".
It is probably somewhat hard to hit because process A has to pass
through a synchronize_rcu() operation while process B is between
mutex_unlock() and get_pid().

Fix it by ensuring that by the time a pointer to the current task's pid
is stored in the file, an extra reference to the pid has been taken.

This fix also removes the condition for synchronize_rcu(); I think
that optimization is unnecessary complexity, since in that case we
would usually have bailed out on the lockless check above."	7.0	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

There was already a reported SSRF vulnerability via file import. It was fixed by resolving all DNS names and checking if the requested IP is an internal IP address. However it is possible to bypass this security measure and execute a SSRF using redirects. Directus allows redirects when importing file from the URL and does not check the result URL. Thus, it is possible to execute a request to an internal IP, for example to 127.0.0.1. However, it is blind SSRF, because Directus also uses response interception technique to get the information about the connect from the socket directly and it does not show a response if the IP address is internal.

The file `packages/electron-updater/src/windowsExecutableCodeSignatureVerifier.ts` implements the signature validation routine for Electron applications on Windows. Because of the surrounding shell, a first pass by `cmd.exe` expands any environment variable found in command-line above. This creates a situation where `verifySignature()` can be tricked into validating the certificate of a different file than the one that was just downloaded. If the step is successful, the malicious update will be executed even if its signature is invalid. This attack assumes a compromised update manifest (server compromise, Man-in-the-Middle attack if fetched over HTTP, Cross-Site Scripting to point the application to a malicious updater server, etc.).

If a Zot `accessControl` policy allows users read access to some repositories but restricts read access to other repositories and `dedupe` is enabled (it is enabled by default), then an attacker who knows the name of an image and the digest of a blob (that they do not have read access to), they may maliciously read it via a second repository they do have read access to. 
 This attack is possible because [`ImageStore.CheckBlob()` calls `checkCacheBlob()`](https://github.com/project-zot/zot/blob/v2.1.0-rc2/pkg/storage/imagestore/imagestore.go#L1158-L1159) to find the blob a global cache by searching for the digest.

In v1.5, PrivateBin introduced the YOURLS server-side proxy. The idea was to allow using the YOURLs URL shortener without running the YOURLs instance without authentication and/or exposing the authentication token to the public, allowing anyone to shorten any URL. With the proxy mechanism, anyone can shorten any URL pointing to the configured PrivateBin instance.

CVE-2024-39488	2024-07-10T08:15:11.003	2025-09-17T16:14:45.883	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: asm-bug: Add .align 2 to the end of __BUG_ENTRY

When CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE=n, we fail to add necessary padding bytes
to bug_table entries, and as a result the last entry in a bug table will
be ignored, potentially leading to an unexpected panic(). All prior
entries in the table will be handled correctly.

The arm64 ABI requires that struct fields of up to 8 bytes are
naturally-aligned, with padding added within a struct such that struct
are suitably aligned within arrays.

When CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERPOSE=y, the layout of a bug_entry is:

	struct bug_entry {
		signed int      bug_addr_disp;	// 4 bytes
		signed int      file_disp;	// 4 bytes
		unsigned short  line;		// 2 bytes
		unsigned short  flags;		// 2 bytes
	}

... with 12 bytes total, requiring 4-byte alignment.

When CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE=n, the layout of a bug_entry is:

	struct bug_entry {
		signed int      bug_addr_disp;	// 4 bytes
		unsigned short  flags;		// 2 bytes
		< implicit padding >		// 2 bytes
	}

... with 8 bytes total, with 6 bytes of data and 2 bytes of trailing
padding, requiring 4-byte alginment.

When we create a bug_entry in assembly, we align the start of the entry
to 4 bytes, which implicitly handles padding for any prior entries.
However, we do not align the end of the entry, and so when
CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE=n, the final entry lacks the trailing padding
bytes.

For the main kernel image this is not a problem as find_bug() doesn't
depend on the trailing padding bytes when searching for entries:

	for (bug = __start___bug_table; bug < __stop___bug_table; ++bug)
		if (bugaddr == bug_addr(bug))
			return bug;

However for modules, module_bug_finalize() depends on the trailing
bytes when calculating the number of entries:

	mod->num_bugs = sechdrs[i].sh_size / sizeof(struct bug_entry);

... and as the last bug_entry lacks the necessary padding bytes, this entry
will not be counted, e.g. in the case of a single entry:

	sechdrs[i].sh_size == 6
	sizeof(struct bug_entry) == 8;

	sechdrs[i].sh_size / sizeof(struct bug_entry) == 0;

Consequently module_find_bug() will miss the last bug_entry when it does:

	for (i = 0; i < mod->num_bugs; ++i, ++bug)
		if (bugaddr == bug_addr(bug))
			goto out;

... which can lead to a kenrel panic due to an unhandled bug.

This can be demonstrated with the following module:

	static int __init buginit(void)
	{
		WARN(1, ""hello\n"");
		return 0;
	}

	static void __exit bugexit(void)
	{
	}

	module_init(buginit);
	module_exit(bugexit);
	MODULE_LICENSE(""GPL"");

... which will trigger a kernel panic when loaded:

ipv6: sr: fix missing sk_buff release in seg6_input_core

uses the skb_cow_head() to ensure that there is sufficient headroom in

In the event that the skb_cow_header() function fails, the
seg6_input_core() catches the error but it does not release the sk_buff,
which will result in a memory leak.

This issue was introduced in commit af3b5158b89d (""ipv6: sr: fix BUG due

On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms with BGP multipath enabled, a specific multipath calculation removes the original next hop from the multipath lead routes nexthop-set. When this change happens, multipath relies on certain internal timing to record the update.  Under certain circumstance and with specific timing, this could result in an rpd crash.

Continued receipt of these connections will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

The issue is triggered when a high rate of concurrent SSH requests are received and terminated in a specific way, causing xinetd to crash, and leaving defunct sshd processes. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability blocks both SSH access as well as services which rely upon SSH, such as SFTP, and Netconf over SSH.

Once the system is in this state, legitimate users will be unable to SSH to the device until service is manually restored.  See WORKAROUND section below.

Administrators can monitor an increase in defunct sshd processes by utilizing the CLI command:

If a value is configured for DDoS bandwidth or burst parameters for any protocol in
a queue, all protocols which share the same queue will have
their bandwidth or burst value changed to the new value. If, for example, OSPF was configured with a certain bandwidth value, ISIS would also be limited to this value. So inadvertently either the control plane is open for a high level of specific traffic which was supposed to be limited to a lower value, or the limit for a certain protocol is so low that chances to succeed with a volumetric DoS attack are significantly increased.

sock_map: avoid race between sock_map_close and sk_psock_put

sk_psock_get will return NULL if the refcount of psock has gone to 0, which
will happen when the last call of sk_psock_put is done. However,
sk_psock_drop may not have finished yet, so the close callback will still
point to sock_map_close despite psock being NULL.

This can be reproduced with a thread deleting an element from the sock map,
while the second one creates a socket, adds it to the map and closes it.

That will trigger the WARN_ON_ONCE:

ionic: fix use after netif_napi_del()

When queues are started, netif_napi_add() and napi_enable() are called.
If there are 4 queues and only 3 queues are used for the current
configuration, only 3 queues' napi should be registered and enabled.
The ionic_qcq_enable() checks whether the .poll pointer is not NULL for
enabling only the using queue' napi. Unused queues' napi will not be
registered by netif_napi_add(), so the .poll pointer indicates NULL.
But it couldn't distinguish whether the napi was unregistered or not
because netif_napi_del() doesn't reset the .poll pointer to NULL.
So, ionic_qcq_enable() calls napi_enable() for the queue, which was
unregistered by netif_napi_del().

netfilter: ipset: Fix race between namespace cleanup and gc in the list:set type

Lion Ackermann reported that there is a race condition between namespace cleanup

cleanup can destroy the list:set type of sets while the gc of the set type is
waiting to run in rcu cleanup. The latter uses data from the destroyed set which
thus leads use after free. The patch contains the following parts:

- When destroying all sets, first remove the garbage collectors, then wait
  if needed and then destroy the sets.
- Fix the badly ordered ""wait then remove gc"" for the destroy a single set
  case.
- Fix the missing rcu locking in the list:set type in the userspace test
  case.

liquidio: Adjust a NULL pointer handling path in lio_vf_rep_copy_packet

In lio_vf_rep_copy_packet() pg_info->page is compared to a NULL value,
but then it is unconditionally passed to skb_add_rx_frag() which looks
strange and could lead to null pointer dereference.

lio_vf_rep_copy_packet() call trace looks like:
	octeon_droq_process_packets
	 octeon_droq_fast_process_packets
	  octeon_droq_dispatch_pkt
	   octeon_create_recv_info
	    ...search in the dispatch_list...
	     ->disp_fn(rdisp->rinfo, ...)
	      lio_vf_rep_pkt_recv(struct octeon_recv_info *recv_info, ...)
In this path there is no code which sets pg_info->page to NULL.
So this check looks unneeded and doesn't solve potential problem.
But I guess the author had reason to add a check and I have no such card
and can't do real test.
In addition, the code in the function liquidio_push_packet() in
liquidio/lio_core.c does exactly the same.

Based on this, I consider the most acceptable compromise solution to
adjust this issue by moving skb_add_rx_frag() into conditional scope.

This issue is caused by issuing a restore command when the daemon is still
alive, which results in a request being processed multiple times thus
triggering a UAF. So to avoid this problem, add an additional reference
count to cachefiles_req, which is held while waiting and reading, and then
released when the waiting and reading is over.

Note that since there is only one reference count for waiting, we need to
avoid the same request being completed multiple times, so we can only
complete the request if it is successfully removed from the xarray."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Testing showed that the problem did not occur if the two error
messages -- the first two lines above -- were removed; apparently adding
material to the kernel log takes a surprisingly large amount of time.

In any case, the best approach for preventing these lockups and to
avoid spamming the log with thousands of error messages per second is
to ratelimit the two dev_err() calls.  Therefore we replace them with
dev_err_ratelimited()."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

ionic: fix kernel panic in XDP_TX action

In the XDP_TX path, ionic driver sends a packet to the TX path with rx

After tx is done, ionic_tx_clean() frees that page.
But RX ring buffer isn't reset to NULL.
So, it uses a freed page, which causes kernel panic.

ax25: Fix refcount imbalance on inbound connections

When releasing a socket in ax25_release(), we call netdev_put() to
decrease the refcount on the associated ax.25 device. However, the
execution path for accepting an incoming connection never calls
netdev_hold(). This imbalance leads to refcount errors, and ultimately
to kernel crashes.

A typical call trace for the above situation will start with one of the
following errors:

    refcount_t: decrement hit 0; leaking memory.
    refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.

And will then have a trace like:

On reboot (or any attempt to remove the interface), the kernel gets
stuck in an infinite loop:

    unregister_netdevice: waiting for ax0 to become free. Usage count = 0

This patch corrects these issues by ensuring that we call netdev_hold()
and ax25_dev_hold() for new connections in ax25_accept(). This makes the
logic leading to ax25_accept() match the logic for ax25_bind(): in both
cases we increment the refcount, which is ultimately decremented in
ax25_release()."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-40918	2024-07-12T13:15:14.863	2025-09-17T15:37:44.190	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

parisc: Try to fix random segmentation faults in package builds

PA-RISC systems with PA8800 and PA8900 processors have had problems
with random segmentation faults for many years.  Systems with earlier
processors are much more stable.

Systems with PA8800 and PA8900 processors have a large L2 cache which
needs per page flushing for decent performance when a large range is
flushed. The combined cache in these systems is also more sensitive to
non-equivalent aliases than the caches in earlier systems.

The majority of random segmentation faults that I have looked at
appear to be memory corruption in memory allocated using mmap and
malloc.

My first attempt at fixing the random faults didn't work. On
reviewing the cache code, I realized that there were two issues
which the existing code didn't handle correctly. Both relate
to cache move-in. Another issue is that the present bit in PTEs
is racy.

1) PA-RISC caches have a mind of their own and they can speculatively
load data and instructions for a page as long as there is a entry in
the TLB for the page which allows move-in. TLBs are local to each
CPU. Thus, the TLB entry for a page must be purged before flushing
the page. This is particularly important on SMP systems.

In some of the flush routines, the flush routine would be called
and then the TLB entry would be purged. This was because the flush
routine needed the TLB entry to do the flush.

2) My initial approach to trying the fix the random faults was to
try and use flush_cache_page_if_present for all flush operations.
This actually made things worse and led to a couple of hardware
lockups. It finally dawned on me that some lines weren't being
flushed because the pte check code was racy. This resulted in
random inequivalent mappings to physical pages.

The __flush_cache_page tmpalias flush sets up its own TLB entry
and it doesn't need the existing TLB entry. As long as we can find
the pte pointer for the vm page, we can get the pfn and physical
address of the page. We can also purge the TLB entry for the page
before doing the flush. Further, __flush_cache_page uses a special
TLB entry that inhibits cache move-in.

When switching page mappings, we need to ensure that lines are
removed from the cache.  It is not sufficient to just flush the
lines to memory as they may come back.

This made it clear that we needed to implement all the required
flush operations using tmpalias routines. This includes flushes
for user and kernel pages.

After modifying the code to use tmpalias flushes, it became clear
that the random segmentation faults were not fully resolved. The
frequency of faults was worse on systems with a 64 MB L2 (PA8900)
and systems with more CPUs (rp4440).

The warning that I added to flush_cache_page_if_present to detect
pages that couldn't be flushed triggered frequently on some systems.

Helge and I looked at the pages that couldn't be flushed and found
that the PTE was either cleared or for a swap page. Ignoring pages
that were swapped out seemed okay but pages with cleared PTEs seemed
problematic.

I looked at routines related to pte_clear and noticed ptep_clear_flush.
The default implementation just flushes the TLB entry. However, it was
obvious that on parisc we need to flush the cache page as well. If
we don't flush the cache page, stale lines will be left in the cache
and cause random corruption. Once a PTE is cleared, there is no way
to find the physical address associated with the PTE and flush the
associated page at a later time.

I implemented an updated change with a parisc specific version of
ptep_clear_flush. It fixed the random data corruption on Helge's rp4440
and rp3440, as well as on my c8000.

At this point, I realized that I could restore the code where we only
flush in flush_cache_page_if_present if the page has been accessed.
However, for this, we also need to flush the cache when the accessed
bit is cleared in

block: fix request.queuelist usage in flush

Friedrich Weber reported a kernel crash problem and bisected to commit
81ada09cc25e (""blk-flush: reuse rq queuelist in flush state machine"").

The root cause is that we use ""list_move_tail(&rq->queuelist, pending)""
in the PREFLUSH/POSTFLUSH sequences. But rq->queuelist.next == xxx since
it's popped out from plug->cached_rq in __blk_mq_alloc_requests_batch().
We don't initialize its queuelist just for this first request, although
the queuelist of all later popped requests will be initialized.

Fix it by changing to use ""list_add_tail(&rq->queuelist, pending)"" so
rq->queuelist doesn't need to be initialized. It should be ok since rq
can't be on any list when PREFLUSH or POSTFLUSH, has no move actually.

Please note the commit 81ada09cc25e (""blk-flush: reuse rq queuelist in
flush state machine"") also has another requirement that no drivers would
touch rq->queuelist after blk_mq_end_request() since we will reuse it to
add rq to the post-flush pending list in POSTFLUSH. If this is not true,
we will have to revert that commit IMHO.

This updated version adds ""list_del_init(&rq->queuelist)"" in flush rq
callback since the dm layer may submit request of a weird invalid format
(REQ_FSEQ_PREFLUSH | REQ_FSEQ_POSTFLUSH), which causes double list_add
if without this ""list_del_init(&rq->queuelist)"". The weird invalid format
problem should be fixed in dm layer."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

xhci: Handle TD clearing for multiple streams case

When multiple streams are in use, multiple TDs might be in flight when
an endpoint is stopped. We need to issue a Set TR Dequeue Pointer for
each, to ensure everything is reset properly and the caches cleared.
Change the logic so that any N>1 TDs found active for different streams
are deferred until after the first one is processed, calling
xhci_invalidate_cancelled_tds() again from xhci_handle_cmd_set_deq() to
queue another command until we are done with all of them. Also change
the error/""should never happen"" paths to ensure we at least clear any
affected TDs, even if we can't issue a command to clear the hardware
cache, and complain loudly with an xhci_warn() if this ever happens.

This problem case dates back to commit e9df17eb1408 (""USB: xhci: Correct
assumptions about number of rings per endpoint."") early on in the XHCI
driver's life, when stream support was first added.
It was then identified but not fixed nor made into a warning in commit
674f8438c121 (""xhci: split handling halted endpoints into two steps""),
which added a FIXME comment for the problem case (without materially
changing the behavior as far as I can tell, though the new logic made
the problem more obvious).

Then later, in commit 94f339147fc3 (""xhci: Fix failure to give back some
cached cancelled URBs.""), it was acknowledged again.

[Mathias: commit 94f339147fc3 (""xhci: Fix failure to give back some cached
cancelled URBs."") was a targeted regression fix to the previously mentioned
patch. Users reported issues with usb stuck after unmounting/disconnecting
UAS devices. This rolled back the TD clearing of multiple streams to its
original state.]

Apparently the commit author was aware of the problem (yet still chose
to submit it): It was still mentioned as a FIXME, an xhci_dbg() was
added to log the problem condition, and the remaining issue was mentioned
in the commit description. The choice of making the log type xhci_dbg()
for what is, at this point, a completely unhandled and known broken
condition is puzzling and unfortunate, as it guarantees that no actual
users would see the log in production, thereby making it nigh
undebuggable (indeed, even if you turn on DEBUG, the message doesn't
really hint at there being a problem at all).

It took me *months* of random xHC crashes to finally find a reliable
repro and be able to do a deep dive debug session, which could all have
been avoided had this unhandled, broken condition been actually reported
with a warning, as it should have been as a bug intentionally left in
unfixed (never mind that it shouldn't have been left in at all).

> Another fix to solve clearing the caches of all stream rings with
> cancelled TDs is needed, but not as urgent.

3 years after that statement and 14 years after the original bug was
introduced, I think it's finally time to fix it. And maybe next time
let's not leave bugs unfixed (that are actually worse than the original
bug), and let's actually get people to review kernel commits please.

Fixes xHC crashes and IOMMU faults with UAS devices when handling
errors/faults. Easiest repro is to use `hdparm` to mark an early sector
(e.g. 1024) on a disk as bad, then `cat /dev/sdX > /dev/null` in a loop.
At least in the case of JMicron controllers, the read errors end up
having to cancel two TDs (for two queued requests to different streams)
and the one that didn't get cleared properly ends up faulting the xHC
entirely when it tries to access DMA pages that have since been unmapped,
referred to by the stale TDs. This normally happens quickly (after two
or three loops). After this fix, I left the `cat` in a loop running
overnight and experienced no xHC failures, with all read errors
recovered properly. Repro'd and tested on an Apple M1 Mac Mini
(dwc3 host).

On systems without an IOMMU, this bug would instead silently corrupt
freed memory, making this a

Commit c7423dbdbc9e (""ima: Handle -ESTALE returned by
ima_filter_rule_match()"") introduced call to ima_lsm_copy_rule within a
RCU read-side critical section which contains kmalloc with GFP_KERNEL.
This implies a possible sleep and violates limitations of RCU read-side
critical sections on non-PREEMPT systems.

Sleeping within RCU read-side critical section might cause
synchronize_rcu() returning early and break RCU protection, allowing a
UAF to happen.

The root cause of this issue could be described as follows:
|	Thread A	|	Thread B	|
|			|ima_match_policy	|
|			|  rcu_read_lock	|
|ima_lsm_update_rule	|			|
|  synchronize_rcu	|			|
|			|    kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL)|
|			|      sleep		|
==> synchronize_rcu returns early
|  kfree(entry)		|			|
|			|    entry = entry->next|
==> UAF happens and entry now becomes NULL (or could be anything).
|			|    entry->action	|
==> Accessing entry might cause panic.

To fix this issue, we are converting all kmalloc that is called within
RCU read-side critical section to use GFP_ATOMIC.

mm: shmem: fix getting incorrect lruvec when replacing a shmem folio

When testing shmem swapin, I encountered the warning below on my machine. 
The reason is that replacing an old shmem folio with a new one causes
mem_cgroup_migrate() to clear the old folio's memcg data.  As a result,
the old folio cannot get the correct memcg's lruvec needed to remove
itself from the LRU list when it is being freed.  This could lead to
possible serious problems, such as LRU list crashes due to holding the
wrong LRU lock, and incorrect LRU statistics.

To fix this issue, we can fallback to use the mem_cgroup_replace_folio()
to replace the old shmem folio.

mm: huge_memory: fix misused mapping_large_folio_support() for anon folios

When I did a large folios split test, a WARNING ""[ 5059.122759][ T166]
Cannot split file folio to non-0 order"" was triggered.  But the test cases
are only for anonmous folios.  while mapping_large_folio_support() is only
reasonable for page cache folios.

In split_huge_page_to_list_to_order(), the folio passed to
mapping_large_folio_support() maybe anonmous folio.  The folio_test_anon()
check is missing.  So the split of the anonmous THP is failed.  This is
also the same for shmem_mapping().  We'd better add a check for both.  But
the shmem_mapping() in __split_huge_page() is not involved, as for
anonmous folios, the end parameter is set to -1, so (head[i].index >= end)
is always false.  shmem_mapping() is not called.

Also add a VM_WARN_ON_ONCE() in mapping_large_folio_support() for anon
mapping, So we can detect the wrong use more easily.

THP folios maybe exist in the pagecache even the file system doesn't
support large folio, it is because when CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE is
enabled, khugepaged will try to collapse read-only file-backed pages to
THP.  But the mapping does not actually support multi order large folios
properly.

Using /sys/kernel/debug/split_huge_pages to verify this, with this patch,
large anon THP is successfully split and the warning is ceased."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

following NULL pointer dereference in ocfs2_journal_dirty() since
b_assoc_map is still not initialized.  This can be easily reproduced by
running xfstests generic/186, which simulate no more credits.

KVM: Fix a data race on last_boosted_vcpu in kvm_vcpu_on_spin()

Use {READ,WRITE}_ONCE() to access kvm->last_boosted_vcpu to ensure the
loads and stores are atomic.  In the extremely unlikely scenario the
compiler tears the stores, it's theoretically possible for KVM to attempt
to get a vCPU using an out-of-bounds index, e.g. if the write is split
into multiple 8-bit stores, and is paired with a 32-bit load on a VM with
257 vCPUs:

  CPU0                              CPU1
  last_boosted_vcpu = 0xff;

                                    (last_boosted_vcpu = 0x100)
                                    last_boosted_vcpu[15:8] = 0x01;
  i = (last_boosted_vcpu = 0x1ff)
                                    last_boosted_vcpu[7:0] = 0x00;

  vcpu = kvm->vcpu_array[0x1ff];

Enabling CONFIG_BTRFS_ASSERT revealed the following assertion to
trigger:

  assertion failed: !list_empty(&ordered->list), in fs/btrfs/zoned.c:1815

This indicates, that we're missing the checksums list on the
ordered_extent. As btrfs/167 is doing a NOCOW write this is to be
expected.

Further analysis with drgn confirmed the assumption:

  >>> inode = prog.crashed_thread().stack_trace()[11]['ordered'].inode
  >>> btrfs_inode = drgn.container_of(inode, ""struct btrfs_inode"", \
         				""vfs_inode"")
  >>> print(btrfs_inode.flags)
  (u32)1

As zoned emulation mode simulates conventional zones on regular devices,
we cannot use zone-append for writing. But we're only attaching dummy
checksums if we're doing a zone-append write.

So for NOCOW zoned data writes on conventional zones, also attach a
dummy checksum."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

axi_desc_put() to handle the hw_desc array correctly.

plpar_hcall(), plpar_hcall9(), and related functions expect callers to

is communicated only through comments in the code and the compiler has
no idea.

For example, if I write a bug like this:

  long retbuf[PLPAR_HCALL_BUFSIZE]; // should be PLPAR_HCALL9_BUFSIZE

platform/x86: x86-android-tablets: Unregister devices in reverse order

  x86_android_tablet_remove

On the Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2 series the bq24190 charger chip also provides
a 5V boost converter output for powering USB devices connected to the micro
USB port, the bq24190-charger driver exports this as a Vbus regulator.

On the 830 (8"") and 1050 (""10"") models this regulator is controlled by
a platform_device and x86_android_tablet_remove() removes platform_device-s
before i2c_clients so the consumer gets removed first.

But on the 1380 (13"") model there is a lc824206xa micro-USB switch
connected over I2C and the extcon driver for that controls the regulator.
The bq24190 i2c-client *must* be registered first, because that creates
the regulator with the lc824206xa listed as its consumer. If the regulator
has not been registered yet the lc824206xa driver will end up getting
a dummy regulator.

Since in this case both the regulator provider and consumer are I2C
devices, the only way to ensure that the consumer is unregistered first
is to unregister the I2C devices in reverse order of in which they were
created.

For consistency and to avoid similar problems in the future change
x86_android_tablet_remove() to unregister all device types in reverse

wifi: ath12k: fix kernel crash during resume

Currently during resume, QMI target memory is not properly handled, resulting
in kernel crash in case DMA remap is not supported:

BUG: Bad page state in process kworker/u16:54  pfn:36e80
page: refcount:1 mapcount:0 mapping:0000000000000000 index:0x0 pfn:0x36e80

 ath12k_qmi_free_target_mem_chunk
 ath12k_qmi_msg_mem_request_cb

The reason is:
Once ath12k module is loaded, firmware sends memory request to host. In case
DMA remap not supported, ath12k refuses the first request due to failure in
allocating with large segment size:

ath12k_pci 0000:04:00.0: qmi firmware request memory request
ath12k_pci 0000:04:00.0: qmi mem seg type 1 size 7077888

Later firmware comes back with more but small segments and allocation
succeeds:

ath12k_pci 0000:04:00.0: qmi mem seg type 1 size 524288

Now ath12k is working. If suspend is triggered, firmware will be reloaded
during resume. As same as before, firmware requests two large segments at
first. In ath12k_qmi_msg_mem_request_cb() segment count and size are
assigned:

	ab->qmi.mem_seg_count == 2
	ab->qmi.target_mem[0].size == 7077888
	ab->qmi.target_mem[1].size == 8454144

Then allocation failed like before and ath12k_qmi_free_target_mem_chunk()
is called to free all allocated segments. Note the first segment is skipped
because its v.addr is cleared due to allocation failure:

	chunk->v.addr = dma_alloc_coherent()

Also note that this leaks that segment because it has not been freed.

While freeing the second segment, a size of 8454144 is passed to
dma_free_coherent(). However remember that this segment is allocated at
the first time firmware is loaded, before suspend. So its real size is
524288, much smaller than 8454144. As a result kernel found we are freeing
some memory which is in use and thus cras

""Crypto requests might return asynchronous. In this case we leave the
 rcu protected region, so force a refcount on the skb's destination

ACPICA: Revert ""ACPICA: avoid Info: mapping multiple BARs. Your kernel is fine.""

Undo the modifications made in commit d410ee5109a1 (""ACPICA: avoid
""Info: mapping multiple BARs. Your kernel is fine.""""). The initial
purpose of this commit was to stop memory mappings for operation
regions from overlapping page boundaries, as it can trigger warnings
if different page attributes are present.

However, it was found that when this situation arises, mapping
continues until the boundary's end, but there is still an attempt to
read/write the entire length of the map, leading to a NULL pointer
deference. For example, if a four-byte mapping request is made but
only one byte is mapped because it hits the current page boundary's
end, a four-byte read/write attempt is still made, resulting in a NULL
pointer deference.

Instead, map the entire length, as the ACPI specification does not
mandate that it must be within the same page boundary. It is
permissible for it to be mapped across different regions."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Normally interval is 0 until s_msg_ratelimit_state is initialized, so
___ratelimit() does nothing. But registering sysfs precedes initializing
rs->lock, so it is possible to change rs->interval to a non-zero value
via the msg_ratelimit_interval_ms interface of sysfs while rs->lock is
uninitialized, and then a call to ext4_msg triggers the problem by
accessing an uninitialized rs->lock. Therefore register sysfs after all

Historically, the signed integer overflow sanitizer did not work in the
kernel due to its interaction with `-fwrapv` but this has since been
changed [1] in the newest version of Clang; It was re-enabled in the
kernel with Commit 557f8c582a9ba8ab (""ubsan: Reintroduce signed overflow
sanitizer"").

Let's rework this overflow checking logic to not actually perform an
overflow during the check itself, thus avoiding the UBSAN splat.

meaning, range is [2,0x7fffffff] with var_off=(0x2; 0x7ffffffd). When in
line 19 the verifier analyzes the branch, it splits the register states
in reg_set_min_max() into the registers of the true branch (true_reg1,
true_reg2) and the registers of the false branch (false_reg1, false_reg2).

Since the test is w6 != 0x7ffffffd, the src_reg is a known constant.
Internally, the verifier creates a ""fake"" register initialized as scalar
to the value of 0x7ffffffd, and then passes it onto reg_set_min_max(). Now,
for line 19, it is mathematically impossible to take the false branch of
this program, yet the verifier analyzes it. It is impossible because the
second bit of r6 will be set due to the prior or operation and the
constant in the condition has that bit unset (hex(fd) == binary(1111 1101).

When the verifier first analyzes the false / fall-through branch, it will
compute an intersection between the var_off of r6 and of the constant. This
is because the verifier creates a ""fake"" register initialized to the value
of the constant. The intersection result later refines both registers in
regs_refine_cond_op():

  [...]
  t = tnum_intersect(tnum_subreg(reg1->var_off), tnum_subreg(reg2->var_off));

tracing: Build event generation tests only as modules

The kprobes and synth event generation test modules add events and lock
(get a reference) those event file reference in module init function,
and unlock and delete it in module exit function. This is because those
are designed for playing as modules.

If we make those modules as built-in, those events are left locked in the
kernel, and never be removed. This causes kprobe event self-test failure
as below.

netrom: Fix a memory leak in nr_heartbeat_expiry()

syzbot reported a memory leak in nr_create() [0].

Commit 409db27e3a2e (""netrom: Fix use-after-free of a listening socket."")
added sock_hold() to the nr_heartbeat_expiry() function, where
a) a socket has a SOCK_DESTROY flag or
b) a listening socket has a SOCK_DEAD flag.

But in the case ""a,"" when the SOCK_DESTROY flag is set, the file descriptor
has already been closed and the nr_release() function has been called.
So it makes no sense to hold the reference count because no one will
call another nr_destroy_socket() and put it as in the case ""b.""

    nr_start_heartbeat

nr_release

CVE-2024-39916	2024-07-12T15:15:11.813	2024-11-21T09:28:33.610	FOG is a free open-source cloning/imaging/rescue suite/inventory management system. There is a security issue with the NFS configuration in /etc/exports generated by the installer that allows an attacker to modify files outside the export in the default installation. The exports have the no_subtree_check option. The no_subtree_check option means that if a client performs a file operation, the server will only check if the requested file is on the correct filesystem, not if it is in the correct directory. This enables modifying files in /images, accessing other files on the same filesystem, and accessing files on other filesystems.

Editors that use `MediaEmbedElement` and pass custom `urlParsers` to the `useMediaState` hook may be vulnerable to XSS if a custom parser allows `javascript:`, `data:` or `vbscript:` URLs to be embedded. Editors that do not use `urlParsers` and consume the `url` property directly may also be vulnerable if the URL is not sanitised. The default parsers `parseTwitterUrl` and `parseVideoUrl` are not affected. `@udecode/plate-media` 36.0.10 resolves this issue by only allowing HTTP and HTTPS URLs during parsing. This affects only the `embed` property returned from `useMediaState`. In addition, the `url` property returned from `useMediaState` has been renamed to `unsafeUrl` to indicate that it has not been sanitised. The `url` property on `element` is also unsafe, but has not been renamed. If you're using either of these properties directly, you will still need to validate the URL yourself. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any custom `urlParsers` do not allow `javascript:`, `data:` or `vbscript:` URLs to be returned in the `url` property of their return values. If `url` is consumed directly, validate the URL protocol before passing it to the `iframe` element.

The major changes are:
- vm->task_info is a dynamically allocated ptr now, and its uasge is
  reference counted.
- introducing two new helper funcs for task_info lifecycle management
    - amdgpu_vm_get_task_info: reference counts up task_info before
      returning this info
    - amdgpu_vm_put_task_info: reference counts down task_info
- last put to task_info() frees task_info from the vm.

This patch also does logistical changes required for existing usage
of vm->task_info.

V2: Do not block all the prints when task_info not found (Felix)

V3: Fixed review comments from Felix
   - Fix wrong indentation
   - No debug message for -ENOMEM
   - Add NULL check for task_info

As analyzed by Khazhy Kumykov, the cause of this bug is a race between
read_descriptors() and hub_port_init(): The first routine uses a field
in udev->descriptor, not expecting it to change, while the second
overwrites it.

Prior to commit 45bf39f8df7f (""USB: core: Don't hold device lock while
reading the ""descriptors"" sysfs file"") this race couldn't occur,
because the routines were mutually exclusive thanks to the device
locking.  Removing that locking from read_descriptors() exposed it to
the race.

The best way to fix the bug is to keep hub_port_init() from changing
udev->descriptor once udev has been initialized and registered.
Drivers expect the descriptors stored in the kernel to be immutable;
we should not undermine this expectation.  In fact, this change should
have been made long ago.

So now hub_port_init() will take an additional argument, specifying a
buffer in which to store the device descriptor it reads.  (If udev has
not yet been initialized, the buffer pointer will be NULL and then
hub_port_init() will store the device descriptor in udev as before.)
This eliminates the data race responsible for the out-of-bounds read.

The changes to hub_port_init() appear more extensive than they really
are, because of indentation changes resulting from an attempt to avoid
writing to other parts of the usb_device structure after it has been
initialized.  Similar changes should be made to the code that reads
the BOS descriptor, but that can be handled in a separate patch later
on.  This patch is sufficient to fix the bug found by syzbot."	6.4	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

vsock: remove vsock from connected table when connect is interrupted by a signal

vsock_connect() expects that the socket could already be in the
TCP_ESTABLISHED state when the connecting task wakes up with a signal
pending. If this happens the socket will be in the connected table, and
it is not removed when the socket state is reset. In this situation it's
common for the process to retry connect(), and if the connection is
successful the socket will be added to the connected table a second
time, corrupting the list.

Prevent this by calling vsock_remove_connected() if a signal is received
while waiting for a connection. This is harmless if the socket is not in
the connected table, and if it is in the table then removing it will
prevent list corruption from a double add.

nvme: fix a possible use-after-free in controller reset during load

Unlike .queue_rq, in .submit_async_event drivers may not check the ctrl
readiness for AER submission. This may lead to a use-after-free
condition that was observed with nvme-tcp.

The race condition may happen in the following scenario:
1. driver executes its reset_ctrl_work
2. -> nvme_stop_ctrl - flushes ctrl async_event_work
3. ctrl sends AEN which is received by the host, which in turn
   schedules AEN handling
4. teardown admin queue (which releases the queue socket)
5. AEN processed, submits another AER, calling the driver to submit
6. driver attempts to send the cmd
==> use-after-free

In order to fix that, add ctrl state check to validate the ctrl
is actually able to accept the AER submission.

This addresses the above race in controller resets because the driver
during teardown should:
1. change ctrl state to RESETTING
2. flush async_event_work (as well as other async work elements)

So after 1,2, any other AER command will find the
ctrl state to be RESETTING and bail out without submitting the AER."	7.0	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

mm: don't try to NUMA-migrate COW pages that have other uses

Oded Gabbay reports that enabling NUMA balancing causes corruption with
his Gaudi accelerator test load:

 ""All the details are in the bug, but the bottom line is that somehow,
  this patch causes corruption when the numa balancing feature is
  enabled AND we don't use process affinity AND we use GUP to pin pages
  so our accelerator can DMA to/from system memory.

  Either disabling numa balancing, using process affinity to bind to
  specific numa-node or reverting this patch causes the bug to
  disappear""

and Oded bisected the issue to commit 09854ba94c6a (""mm: do_wp_page()
simplification"").

Now, the NUMA balancing shouldn't actually be changing the writability
of a page, and as such shouldn't matter for COW.  But it appears it
does.  Suspicious.

However, regardless of that, the condition for enabling NUMA faults in
change_pte_range() is nonsensical.  It uses ""page_mapcount(page)"" to
decide if a COW page should be NUMA-protected or not, and that makes
absolutely no sense.

The number of mappings a page has is irrelevant: not only does GUP get a
reference to a page as in Oded's case, but the other mappings migth be
paged out and the only reference to them would be in the page count.

Since we should never try to NUMA-balance a page that we can't move
anyway due to other references, just fix the code to use 'page_count()'.
Oded confirms that that fixes his issue.

Now, this does imply that something in NUMA balancing ends up changing
page protections (other than the obvious one of making the page
inaccessible to get the NUMA faulting information).  Otherwise the COW
simplification wouldn't matter - since doing the GUP on the page would
make sure it's writable.

The cause of that permission change would be good to figure out too,
since it clearly results in spurious COW events - but fixing the
nonsensical test that just happened to work before is obviously the
CorrectThing(tm) to do regardless."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Vlastimil Babka investigated a crash dump and found that a task

This failure is specific to CONFIG_PREEMPT=n builds.  The root of the
problem is that kcompact0 is not rescheduling on a CPU while a task that
has isolated a large number of the pages from the LRU is waiting on
kcompact0 to reschedule so the pages can be released.  While
shrink_inactive_list() only loops once around too_many_isolated, reclaim
can continue without rescheduling if sc->skipped_deactivate == 1 which
could happen if there was no file LRU and the inactive anon list was not
low."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

iio: buffer: Fix file related error handling in IIO_BUFFER_GET_FD_IOCTL

If we fail to copy the just created file descriptor to userland, we
try to clean up by putting back 'fd' and freeing 'ib'. The code uses
put_unused_fd() for the former which is wrong, as the file descriptor
was already published by fd_install() which gets called internally by
anon_inode_getfd().

This makes the error handling code leaving a half cleaned up file
descriptor table around and a partially destructed 'file' object,
allowing userland to play use-after-free tricks on us, by abusing
the still usable fd and making the code operate on a dangling
'file->private_data' pointer.

Instead of leaving the kernel in a partially corrupted state, don't
attempt to explicitly clean up and leave this to the process exit
path that'll release any still valid fds, including the one created
by the previous call to anon_inode_getfd(). Simply return -EFAULT to

The reproducer was trying to read /proc/$PID/smaps when calling
MADV_FREE at the mean time.  MADV_FREE may split THPs if it is called
for partial THP.  It may trigger the below race:

           CPU A                         CPU B
           -----                         -----
  smaps walk:                      MADV_FREE:
  page_mapcount()
    PageCompound()
                                   split_huge_page()
    page = compound_head(page)
    PageDoubleMap(page)

When calling PageDoubleMap() this page is not a tail page of THP anymore
so the BUG is triggered.

This could be fixed by elevated refcount of the page before calling
mapcount, but that would prevent it from counting migration entries, and
it seems overkilling because the race just could happen when PMD is
split so all PTE entries of tail pages are actually migration entries,
and smaps_account() does treat migration entries as mapcount == 1 as
Kirill pointed out.

Add a new parameter for smaps_account() to tell this entry is migration
entry then skip calling page_mapcount().  Don't skip getting mapcount
for device private entries since they do track references with mapcount.

Pagemap also has the similar issue although it was not reported.  Fixed
it as well.

net: usb: ax88179_178a: Fix out-of-bounds accesses in RX fixup

ax88179_rx_fixup() contains several out-of-bounds accesses that can be
triggered by a malicious (or defective) USB device, in particular:

 - The metadata array (hdr_off..hdr_off+2*pkt_cnt) can be out of bounds,
   causing OOB reads and (on big-endian systems) OOB endianness flips.
 - A packet can overlap the metadata array, causing a later OOB
   endianness flip to corrupt data used by a cloned SKB that has already
   been handed off into the network stack.
 - A packet SKB can be constructed whose tail is far beyond its end,
   causing out-of-bounds heap data to be considered part of the SKB's
   data.

I have tested that this can be used by a malicious USB device to send a
bogus ICMPv6 Echo Request and receive an ICMPv6 Echo Reply in response
that contains random kernel heap data.
It's probably also possible to get OOB writes from this on a

It can be seen from the stack trace that the problem is that the
deregistration of the master causes a dev_close(), which gets notified
as NETDEV_GOING_DOWN to dsa_slave_netdevice_event().
But dsa_switch_shutdown() has already run, and this has unregistered the
DSA slave interfaces, and yet, the NETDEV_GOING_DOWN handler attempts to
call dev_close_many() on those slave interfaces, leading to the problem.

The previous attempt to avoid the NETDEV_GOING_DOWN on the master after
dsa_switch_shutdown() was called seems improper. Unregistering the slave
interfaces is unnecessary and unhelpful. Instead, after the slaves have
stopped being uppers of the DSA master, we can now reset to NULL the
master->dsa_ptr pointer, which will make DSA start ignoring all future
notifier events on the master."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

The issue is the uncloned dst+metadata is initialized with a refcount of

tun_dst_unclone returns, the dst+metadata is only referenced from a
single place (the skb) while its refcount is 2. Its refcount will never

CVE-2022-48811	2024-07-16T12:15:05.367	2025-09-25T19:37:05.513	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ibmvnic: don't release napi in __ibmvnic_open()

If __ibmvnic_open() encounters an error such as when setting link state,
it calls release_resources() which frees the napi structures needlessly.
Instead, have __ibmvnic_open() only clean up the work it did so far (i.e.
disable napi and irqs) and leave the rest to the callers.

If caller of __ibmvnic_open() is ibmvnic_open(), it should release the
resources immediately. If the caller is do_reset() or do_hard_reset(),
they will release the resources on the next reset.

This fixes following crash that occurred when running the drmgr command
several times to add/remove a vnic interface:

usb: f_fs: Fix use-after-free for epfile

Consider a case where ffs_func_eps_disable is called from

ffs_epfile_release will free up the read buffer and call
ffs_data_closed which in turn destroys ffs->epfiles and
mark it as NULL. While this was happening the driver has
already initialized the local epfile in ffs_func_eps_disable
which is now freed and waiting to acquire the spinlock. Once
spinlock is acquired the driver proceeds with the stale value
of epfile and tries to free the already freed read buffer
causing use-after-free.

Following is the illustration of the race:

   ffs_func_eps_disable

NFSD: Fix the behavior of READ near OFFSET_MAX

Dan Aloni reports:
> Due to commit 8cfb9015280d (""NFS: Always provide aligned buffers to
> the RPC read layers"") on the client, a read of 0xfff is aligned up
> to server rsize of 0x1000.
>
> As a result, in a test where the server has a file of size
> 0x7fffffffffffffff, and the client tries to read from the offset
> 0x7ffffffffffff000, the read causes loff_t overflow in the server
> and it returns an NFS code of EINVAL to the client. The client as
> a result indefinitely retries the request.

The Linux NFS client does not handle NFS?ERR_INVAL, even though all
NFS specifications permit servers to return that status code for a
READ.

Instead of NFS?ERR_INVAL, have out-of-range READ requests succeed
and return a short result. Set the EOF flag in the result to prevent
the client from retrying the READ request. This behavior appears to
be consistent with Solaris NFS servers.

Note that NFSv3 and NFSv4 use u64 offset values on the wire. These
must be converted to loff_t internally before use -- an implicit
type cast is not adequate for this purpose. Otherwise VFS checks
against sb->s_maxbytes do not work properly."	7.1	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H

NFSD: Fix ia_size underflow

iattr::ia_size is a loff_t, which is a signed 64-bit type. NFSv3 and
NFSv4 both define file size as an unsigned 64-bit type. Thus there
is a range of valid file size values an NFS client can send that is
already larger than Linux can handle.

Currently decode_fattr4() dumps a full u64 value into ia_size. If
that value happens to be larger than S64_MAX, then ia_size
underflows. I'm about to fix up the NFSv3 behavior as well, so let's
catch the underflow in the common code path: nfsd_setattr()."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

than s64_max without corrupting the value.

Silently capping the value results in storing a different value
than the client passed in which is unexpected behavior, so remove
the min_t() check in decode_sattr3().

Note that RFC 1813 permits only the WRITE procedure to return
NFS3ERR_FBIG. We believe that NFSv3 reference implementations
also return NFS3ERR_FBIG when ia_size is too large."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

btrfs: skip reserved bytes warning on unmount after log cleanup failure

After the recent changes made by commit c2e39305299f01 (""btrfs: clear
extent buffer uptodate when we fail to write it"") and its followup fix,
commit 651740a5024117 (""btrfs: check WRITE_ERR when trying to read an
extent buffer""), we can now end up not cleaning up space reservations of
log tree extent buffers after a transaction abort happens, as well as not
cleaning up still dirty extent buffers.

This happens because if writeback for a log tree extent buffer failed,
then we have cleared the bit EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE from the extent buffer
and we have also set the bit EXTENT_BUFFER_WRITE_ERR on it. Later on,
when trying to free the log tree with free_log_tree(), which iterates
over the tree, we can end up getting an -EIO error when trying to read
a node or a leaf, since read_extent_buffer_pages() returns -EIO if an
extent buffer does not have EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE set and has the
EXTENT_BUFFER_WRITE_ERR bit set. Getting that -EIO means that we return
immediately as we can not iterate over the entire tree.

In that case we never update the reserved space for an extent buffer in
the respective block group and space_info object.

When this happens we get the following traces when unmounting the fs:

Although the bug manifested in the driver core, the real cause was a
race with the gadget core.  dev_uevent() does:

	if (dev->driver)
		add_uevent_var(env, ""DRIVER=%s"", dev->driver->name);

and between the test and the dereference of dev->driver, the gadget
core sets dev->driver to NULL.

The race wouldn't occur if the gadget core registered its devices on
a real bus, using the standard synchronization techniques of the
driver core.  However, it's not necessary to make such a large change
in order to fix this bug; all we need to do is make sure that
udc->dev.driver is always NULL.

In fact, there is no reason for udc->dev.driver ever to be set to
anything, let alone to the value it currently gets: the address of the
gadget's driver.  After all, a gadget driver only knows how to manage
a gadget, not how to manage a UDC.

This patch simply removes the statements in the gadget core that touch
udc->dev.driver."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Recent commit 974578017fc1 (""iavf: Add waiting so the port is
initialized in remove"") adds a wait-loop at the beginning of
iavf_remove() to ensure that port initialization is finished
prior unregistering net device. This causes a regression
in reboot/shutdown scenario because in this case callback
iavf_shutdown() is called and this callback detaches the device,
makes it down if it is running and sets its state to __IAVF_REMOVE.
Later shutdown callback of associated PF driver (e.g. ice_shutdown)
is called. That callback calls among other things sriov_disable()
that calls indirectly iavf_remove() (see stack trace below).
As the adapter state is already __IAVF_REMOVE then the mentioned
loop is end-less and shutdown process hangs.

The patch fixes this by checking adapter's state at the beginning
of iavf_remove() and skips the rest of the function if the adapter
is already in remove state (shutdown is in progress).

Reproducer:
1. Create VF on PF driven by ice or i40e driver
2. Ensure that the VF is bound to iavf driver
3. Reboot

1. Command 'ip link ... set nomaster' causes that ice_plug_aux_dev()
   is called from ice_service_task() context, aux device is created
   and associated device->lock is taken.
2. Command 'ip link ... set master...' calls ice's notifier under
   RTNL lock and that notifier calls ice_unplug_aux_dev(). That
   function tries to take aux device->lock but this is already taken
   by ice_plug_aux_dev() in step 1
3. Later ice_plug_aux_dev() tries to take RTNL lock but this is already
   taken in step 2
4. Dead-lock

The patch fixes this issue by following changes:
- Bit ICE_FLAG_PLUG_AUX_DEV is kept to be set during ice_plug_aux_dev()
  call in ice_service_task()
- The bit is checked in ice_clear_rdma_cap() and only if it is not set
  then ice_unplug_aux_dev() is called. If it is set (in other words
  plugging of aux device was requested and ice_plug_aux_dev() is
  potentially running) then the function only clears the

...for each but CPU 0/boot.
Basic debug printks right before the mentioned line say:

[    0.048170] CPU: 1, smt_mask:

So smt_mask, which is sibling mask obviously, is empty when entering
the function.
This is critical, as sched_core_cpu_starting() calculates
core-scheduling parameters only once per CPU start, and it's crucial
to have all the parameters filled in at that moment (at least it
uses cpu_smt_mask() which in fact is `&cpu_sibling_map[cpu]` on
MIPS).

A bit of debugging led me to that set_cpu_sibling_map() performing
the actual map calculation, was being invocated after
notify_cpu_start(), and exactly the latter function starts CPU HP
callback round (sched_core_cpu_starting() is basically a CPU HP
callback).
While the flow is same on ARM64 (maps after the notifier, although
before calling set_cpu_online()), x86 started calculating sibling
maps earlier than starting the CPU HP callbacks in Linux 4.14 (see
[0] for the reference). Neither me nor my brief tests couldn't find
any potential caveats in calculating the maps right after performing
delay calibration, but the WARN splat is now gone.
The very same debug prints now yield exactly what I expected from
them:

watch_queue: Fix filter limit check

In watch_queue_set_filter(), there are a couple of places where we check
that the filter type value does not exceed what the type_filter bitmap
can hold.  One place calculates the number of bits by:

   if (tf[i].type >= sizeof(wfilter->type_filter) * 8)

which is fine, but the second does:

   if (tf[i].type >= sizeof(wfilter->type_filter) * BITS_PER_LONG)

a too-large type:

 (1) __set_bit() on wfilter->type_filter
 (2) Writing more elements in wfilter->filters[] than we allocated.

Fix this by just using the proper WATCH_TYPE__NR instead, which is the
number of types we actually know about.

The warning complains about an attempt to unregister an

This happens on trace-cmd because it first stops tracing, and
then switches the tracer to nop. Which is equivalent to:

  # cd /sys/kernel/tracing/
  # echo osnoise > current_tracer
  # echo 0 > tracing_on
  # echo nop > current_tracer

The osnoise tracer stops the workload when no trace instance
is actually collecting data. This can be caused both by
disabling tracing or disabling the tracer itself.

To avoid unregistering events twice, use the existing
trace_osnoise_callback_enabled variable to check if the events
(and the workload) are actually active before trying to

swiotlb: fix info leak with DMA_FROM_DEVICE

The problem I'm addressing was discovered by the LTP test covering
cve-2018-1000204.

A short description of what happens follows:
1) The test case issues a command code 00 (TEST UNIT READY) via the SG_IO
   interface with: dxfer_len == 524288, dxdfer_dir == SG_DXFER_FROM_DEV
   and a corresponding dxferp. The peculiar thing about this is that TUR
   is not reading from the device.
2) In sg_start_req() the invocation of blk_rq_map_user() effectively
   bounces the user-space buffer. As if the device was to transfer into
   it. Since commit a45b599ad808 (""scsi: sg: allocate with __GFP_ZERO in
   sg_build_indirect()"") we make sure this first bounce buffer is
   allocated with GFP_ZERO.
3) For the rest of the story we keep ignoring that we have a TUR, so the
   device won't touch the buffer we prepare as if the we had a
   DMA_FROM_DEVICE type of situation. My setup uses a virtio-scsi device
   and the  buffer allocated by SG is mapped by the function
   virtqueue_add_split() which uses DMA_FROM_DEVICE for the ""in"" sgs (here
   scatter-gather and not scsi generics). This mapping involves bouncing
   via the swiotlb (we need swiotlb to do virtio in protected guest like
   s390 Secure Execution, or AMD SEV).
4) When the SCSI TUR is done, we first copy back the content of the second
   (that is swiotlb) bounce buffer (which most likely contains some
   previous IO data), to the first bounce buffer, which contains all
   zeros.  Then we copy back the content of the first bounce buffer to
   the user-space buffer.
5) The test case detects that the buffer, which it zero-initialized,
  ain't all zeros and fails.

One can argue that this is an swiotlb problem, because without swiotlb
we leak all zeros, and the swiotlb should be transparent in a sense that
it does not affect the outcome (if all other participants are well
behaved).

Copying the content of the original buffer into the swiotlb buffer is
the only way I can think of to make swiotlb transparent in such
scenarios. So let's do just that if in doubt, but allow the driver
to tell us that the whole mapped buffer is going to be overwritten,
in which case we can preserve the old behavior and avoid the performance
impact of the extra bounce."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

CVE-2024-41009	2024-07-17T07:15:01.973	2024-11-21T09:32:03.470	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix overrunning reservations in ringbuf

The BPF ring buffer internally is implemented as a power-of-2 sized circular
buffer, with two logical and ever-increasing counters: consumer_pos is the
consumer counter to show which logical position the consumer consumed the
data, and producer_pos which is the producer counter denoting the amount of
data reserved by all producers.

Each time a record is reserved, the producer that ""owns"" the record will
successfully advance producer counter. In user space each time a record is
read, the consumer of the data advanced the consumer counter once it finished
processing. Both counters are stored in separate pages so that from user
space, the producer counter is read-only and the consumer counter is read-write.

One aspect that simplifies and thus speeds up the implementation of both
producers and consumers is how the data area is mapped twice contiguously
back-to-back in the virtual memory, allowing to not take any special measures
for samples that have to wrap around at the end of the circular buffer data
area, because the next page after the last data page would be first data page
again, and thus the sample will still appear completely contiguous in virtual
memory.

Each record has a struct bpf_ringbuf_hdr { u32 len; u32 pg_off; } header for
book-keeping the length and offset, and is inaccessible to the BPF program.
Helpers like bpf_ringbuf_reserve() return `(void *)hdr + BPF_RINGBUF_HDR_SZ`
for the BPF program to use. Bing-Jhong and Muhammad reported that it is however
possible to make a second allocated memory chunk overlapping with the first
chunk and as a result, the BPF program is now able to edit first chunk's
header.

For example, consider the creation of a BPF_MAP_TYPE_RINGBUF map with size
of 0x4000. Next, the consumer_pos is modified to 0x3000 /before/ a call to
bpf_ringbuf_reserve() is made. This will allocate a chunk A, which is in
[0x0,0x3008], and the BPF program is able to edit [0x8,0x3008]. Now, lets
allocate a chunk B with size 0x3000. This will succeed because consumer_pos
was edited ahead of time to pass the `new_prod_pos - cons_pos > rb->mask`
check. Chunk B will be in range [0x3008,0x6010], and the BPF program is able
to edit [0x3010,0x6010]. Due to the ring buffer memory layout mentioned
earlier, the ranges [0x0,0x4000] and [0x4000,0x8000] point to the same data
pages. This means that chunk B at [0x4000,0x4008] is chunk A's header.
bpf_ringbuf_submit() / bpf_ringbuf_discard() use the header's pg_off to then
locate the bpf_ringbuf itself via bpf_ringbuf_restore_from_rec(). Once chunk
B modified chunk A's header, then bpf_ringbuf_commit() refers to the wrong
page and could cause a crash.

Fix it by calculating the oldest pending_pos and check whether the range
from the oldest outstanding record to the newest would span beyond the ring
buffer size. If that is the case, then reject the request. We've tested with
the ring buffer benchmark in BPF selftests (./benchs/run_bench_ringbufs.sh)
before/after the fix and while it seems a bit slower on some benchmarks, it
is still not significantly enough to matter."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H		
CVE-2024-41010	2024-07-17T07:15:02.183	2024-11-21T09:32:03.607	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix too early release of tcx_entry

Pedro Pinto and later independently also Hyunwoo Kim and Wongi Lee reported
an issue that the tcx_entry can be released too early leading to a use
after free (UAF) when an active old-style ingress or clsact qdisc with a
shared tc block is later replaced by another ingress or clsact instance.

Essentially, the sequence to trigger the UAF (one example) can be as follows:

  1. A network namespace is created
  2. An ingress qdisc is created. This allocates a tcx_entry, and
     &tcx_entry->miniq is stored in the qdisc's miniqp->p_miniq. At the
     same time, a tcf block with index 1 is created.
  3. chain0 is attached to the tcf block. chain0 must be connected to
     the block linked to the ingress qdisc to later reach the function
     tcf_chain0_head_change_cb_del() which triggers the UAF.
  4. Create and graft a clsact qdisc. This causes the ingress qdisc
     created in step 1 to be removed, thus freeing the previously linked
     tcx_entry:

     rtnetlink_rcv_msg()
       => tc_modify_qdisc()
         => qdisc_create()
           => clsact_init() [a]
         => qdisc_graft()
           => qdisc_destroy()
             => __qdisc_destroy()
               => ingress_destroy() [b]
                 => tcx_entry_free()
                   => kfree_rcu() // tcx_entry freed

  5. Finally, the network namespace is closed. This registers the
     cleanup_net worker, and during the process of releasing the
     remaining clsact qdisc, it accesses the tcx_entry that was
     already freed in step 4, causing the UAF to occur:

     cleanup_net()
       => ops_exit_list()
         => default_device_exit_batch()
           => unregister_netdevice_many()
             => unregister_netdevice_many_notify()
               => dev_shutdown()
                 => qdisc_put()
                   => clsact_destroy() [c]
                     => tcf_block_put_ext()
                       => tcf_chain0_head_change_cb_del()
                         => tcf_chain_head_change_item()
                           => clsact_chain_head_change()
                             => mini_qdisc_pair_swap() // UAF

There are also other variants, the gist is to add an ingress (or clsact)
qdisc with a specific shared block, then to replace that qdisc, waiting
for the tcx_entry kfree_rcu() to be executed and subsequently accessing
the current active qdisc's miniq one way or another.

The correct fix is to turn the miniq_active boolean into a counter. What
can be observed, at step 2 above, the counter transitions from 0->1, at
step [a] from 1->2 (in order for the miniq object to remain active during
the replacement), then in [b] from 2->1 and finally [c] 1->0 with the
eventual release. The reference counter in general ranges from [0,2] and
it does not need to be atomic since all access to the counter is protected
by the rtnl mutex. With this in place, there is no longer a UAF happening
and the tcx_entry is freed at the correct time."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2024-40640	2024-07-17T18:15:04.787	2024-11-21T09:31:24.770	"vodozemac is an open source implementation of Olm and Megolm in pure Rust.  Versions before 0.7.0 of vodozemac use a non-constant time base64 implementation for importing key material for Megolm group sessions and `PkDecryption` Ed25519 secret keys. This flaw might allow an attacker to infer some information about the secret key material through a side-channel attack. The use of a non-constant time base64 implementation might allow an attacker to observe timing variations in the encoding and decoding operations of the secret key material. This could potentially provide insights into the underlying secret key material. The impact of this vulnerability is considered low because exploiting the attacker is required to have access to high precision timing measurements, as well as repeated access to the base64 encoding or decoding processes.  Additionally, the estimated leakage amount is bounded and low according to the referenced paper. This has been patched in commit 734b6c6948d4b2bdee3dd8b4efa591d93a61d272 which has been included in release version 0.7.0. Users are advised to upgrade.

CVE-2024-40644	2024-07-18T17:15:04.850	2024-11-21T09:31:25.317	gitoxide An idiomatic, lean, fast & safe pure Rust implementation of Git. `gix-path` can be tricked into running another `git.exe` placed in an untrusted location by a limited user account on Windows systems. Windows permits limited user accounts without administrative privileges to create new directories in the root of the system drive. While `gix-path` first looks for `git` using a `PATH` search, in version 0.10.8 it also has a fallback strategy on Windows of checking two hard-coded paths intended to be the 64-bit and 32-bit Program Files directories. Existing functions, as well as the newly introduced `exe_invocation` function, were updated to make use of these alternative locations. This causes facilities in `gix_path::env` to directly execute `git.exe` in those locations, as well as to return its path or whatever configuration it reports to callers who rely on it. Although unusual setups where the system drive is not `C:`, or even where Program Files directories have non-default names, are technically possible, the main problem arises on a 32-bit Windows system. Such a system has no `C:\Program Files (x86)` directory. A limited user on a 32-bit Windows system can therefore create the `C:\Program Files (x86)` directory and populate it with arbitrary contents. Once a payload has been placed at the second of the two hard-coded paths in this way, other user accounts including administrators will execute it if they run an application that uses `gix-path` and do not have `git` in a `PATH` directory. (While having `git` found in a `PATH` search prevents exploitation, merely having it installed in the default location under the real `C:\Program Files` directory does not. This is because the first hard-coded path's `mingw64` component assumes a 64-bit installation.). Only Windows is affected. Exploitation is unlikely except on a 32-bit system. In particular, running a 32-bit build on a 64-bit system is not a risk factor. Furthermore, the attacker must have a user account on the system, though it may be a relatively unprivileged account. Such a user can perform privilege escalation and execute code as another user, though it may be difficult to do so reliably because the targeted user account must run an application or service that uses `gix-path` and must not have `git` in its `PATH`. The main exploitable configuration is one where Git for Windows has been installed but not added to `PATH`. This is one of the options in its installer, though not the default option. Alternatively, an affected program that sanitizes its `PATH` to remove seemingly nonessential directories could allow exploitation. But for the most part, if the target user has configured a `PATH` in which the real `git.exe` can be found, then this cannot be exploited. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.10.9 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.	6.8	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L

A bug in Sentry's Python SDK < 2.8.0 allows the environment variables to be passed to subprocesses despite the `env={}` setting. In Python's `subprocess` calls, all environment variables are passed to subprocesses by default. However, if you specifically do not want them to be passed to subprocesses, you may use `env` argument in `subprocess` calls. Due to the bug in Sentry SDK, with the Stdlib integration enabled (which is enabled by default), this expectation is not fulfilled, and all environment variables are being passed to subprocesses instead. The issue has been patched in pull request #3251 and is included in sentry-sdk==2.8.0. We strongly recommend upgrading to the latest SDK version. However, if it's not possible, and if passing environment variables to child processes poses a security risk for you, you can disable all default integrations.

In affected versions the `BinaryHttpParser` class does not properly validate input values thus giving attackers almost complete control over the HTTP requests constructed from the parsed output. Attackers can abuse several issues individually to perform various injection attacks including HTTP request smuggling, desync attacks, HTTP header injections, request queue poisoning, caching attacks and Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). Attacker could also combine several issues to create well-formed messages for other text-based protocols which may result in attacks beyond the HTTP protocol. The BinaryHttpParser class implements the readRequestHead method which performs most of the relevant parsing of the received request. The data structure prefixes values with a variable length integer value. The parsing code below first gets the lengths of the values from the prefixed variable length integer. After it has all of the lengths and calculates all of the indices, the parser casts the applicable slices of the ByteBuf to String. Finally, it passes these values into a new `DefaultBinaryHttpRequest` object where no further parsing or validation occurs. Method is partially validated while other values are not validated at all.

Sliver version 1.6.0 (prerelease) is vulnerable to RCE on the teamserver by a low-privileged ""operator"" user. The RCE is as the system root user. The exploit is pretty fun as we make the Sliver server pwn itself. As described in a past issue (#65), ""there is a clear security boundary between the operator and server, an operator should not inherently be able to run commands or code on the server."" An operator who exploited this vulnerability would be able to view all console logs, kick all other operators, view and modify files stored on the server, and ultimately delete the server. This issue has not yet be addressed but is expected to be resolved before the full release of version 1.6.0. Users of the 1.6.0 prerelease should avoid using Silver in production."	7.2	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

filelock: Remove locks reliably when fcntl/close race is detected

When fcntl_setlk() races with close(), it removes the created lock with
do_lock_file_wait().
However, LSMs can allow the first do_lock_file_wait() that created the lock
while denying the second do_lock_file_wait() that tries to remove the lock.
Separately, posix_lock_file() could also fail to
remove a lock due to GFP_KERNEL allocation failure (when splitting a range
in the middle).

After the bug has been triggered, use-after-free reads will occur in
lock_get_status() when userspace reads /proc/locks. This can likely be used
to read arbitrary kernel memory, but can't corrupt kernel memory.

Fix it by calling locks_remove_posix() instead, which is designed to
reliably get rid of POSIX locks associated with the given file and
files_struct and is also used by filp_flush()."	6.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H

On certain error conditions, the logs may contain the OIDC token passed to  AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html .

If a webhook is supplied when a  Canarytoken is first created, the site will make a test request to the supplied URL to ensure it accepts alert notification HTTP requests. No safety checks were performed on the URL, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability. The SSRF is Blind because the content of the response is not displayed to the creating user; they are simply told whether an error occurred in making the test request.

This issue affects Apache Pinot: from 0.1 before 1.0.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.0.0 and configure RBAC, which fixes the issue.

Details: 

When using a request to path “/appconfigs” to the controller, it can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such as system information (e.g. arch, os version), environment information (e.g. maxHeapSize) and Pinot configurations (e.g. zookeeper path). This issue was addressed by the  Role-based Access Control https://docs.pinot.apache.org/operators/tutorials/authentication/basic-auth-access-control , so that /appConfigs` and all other APIs can be access controlled. Only authorized users have access to it. Note the user needs to add the admin role accordingly to the RBAC guide to control access to this endpoint, and in the future version of Pinot, a default admin role is planned to be added.

Itcan detect an invalid field and return error. Unfortunately, when doing so it also invokes `free()` on a 4 byte localstack buffer.  Most modern malloc implementations detect this error and immediately abort. Some however accept the input pointer and add that memory to its list of available chunks. This leads to the overwriting of nearby stack memory. The content of the overwrite is decided by the `free()` implementation; likely to be memory pointers and a set of flags.  The most likely outcome of exploting this flaw is a crash, although it cannot be ruled out that more serious results can be had in special circumstances.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.

A security issue was discovered In 2018, where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation. Although this issue was fixed in Docker Engine v18.09.1 in January 2019, the fix was not carried forward to later major versions, resulting in a regression. Anyone who depends on authorization plugins that introspect the request and/or response body to make access control decisions is potentially impacted.

Docker EE v19.03.x and all versions of Mirantis Container Runtime are not vulnerable.

docker-ce v27.1.1 containes patches to fix the vulnerability. Patches have also been merged into the master, 19.03, 20.0, 23.0, 24.0, 25.0, 26.0, and 26.1 release branches. If one is unable to upgrade immediately, avoid using AuthZ plugins and/or restrict access to the Docker API to trusted parties, following the principle of least privilege."	9.9	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H		
CVE-2024-41662	2024-07-24T17:15:11.310	2024-11-21T09:32:55.687	VNote is a note-taking platform. A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the Markdown rendering functionality of versions 3.18.1 and prior of the VNote note-taking application. This vulnerability allows the injection and execution of arbitrary JavaScript code through which remote code execution can be achieved. A patch for this issue is available at commit f1af78573a0ef51d6ef6a0bc4080cddc8f30a545. Other mitigation strategies include implementing rigorous input sanitization for all Markdown content and utilizing a secure Markdown parser that appropriately escapes or strips potentially dangerous content.	8.6	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

Versions of Bitbucket DC from 8.0.0 to 8.9.12 and 8.19.0 to 8.19.1 are affected by this vulnerability. It is patched in 8.9.13 and 8.19.2.

This open redirect vulnerability, with a CVSS Score of 3.1 and a CVSS Vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N, allows an unauthenticated attacker to redirect a victim user upon login to Bitbucket Data Center to any arbitrary site which can be utilized for further exploitation which has low impact to confidentiality, no impact to integrity, no impact to availability, and requires user interaction.

Argo CD has a Web-based terminal that allows users to get a shell inside a running pod, just as they would with kubectl exec. Starting in version 2.6.0, when the administrator enables this function and grants permission to the user `p, role:myrole, exec, create, */*, allow`, even if the user revokes this permission, the user can still perform operations in the container, as long as the user keeps the terminal view open for a long time. Although the token expiration and revocation of the user are fixed, however, the fix does not address the situation of revocation of only user `p, role:myrole, exec, create, */*, allow` permissions, which may still lead to the leakage of sensitive information. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.11.7, 2.10.16, and 2.9.21.	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

In versions 15.0.3 and prior, the `getCustomLoginUrlTemplate` method in RealmOAuth2ProviderSettings.java is vulnerable to template injection due to its usage of user input. Although the developer intended to implement a custom URL for handling login to override the default OpenAM login, they did not restrict the `CustomLoginUrlTemplate`, allowing it to be set freely.

In versions 1.0.0 and prior, content in filesystem is accessible for reading using `sniff_csv`, even with `enable_external_access=false`. This vulnerability provides an attacker with access to filesystem even when access is expected to be disabled and other similar functions do NOT provide access. There seem to be two vectors to this vulnerability. First, access to files that should otherwise not be allowed. Second, the content from a file can be read (e.g. `/etc/hosts`, `proc/self/environ`, etc) even though that doesn't seem to be the intent of the sniff_csv function. A fix for this issue is available in commit c9b7c98aa0e1cd7363fe8bb8543a95f38e980d8a and is expected to be part of version 1.1.0.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

xfs: don't walk off the end of a directory data block

This adds sanity checks for xfs_dir2_data_unused and xfs_dir2_data_entry

loop simply checks that the start offset of the dup and dep is within the
range. So in a crafted image, if last entry is xfs_dir2_data_unused, we
can change dup->length to dup->length-1 and leave 1 byte of space. In the
next traversal, this space will be considered as dup or dep. We may
encounter an out of bound read when accessing the fixed members.

In the patch, we make sure that the remaining bytes large enough to hold
an unused entry before accessing xfs_dir2_data_unused and
xfs_dir2_data_unused is XFS_DIR2_DATA_ALIGN byte aligned. We also make
sure that the remaining bytes large enough to hold a dirent with a

xfs: add bounds checking to xlog_recover_process_data

There is a lack of verification of the space occupied by fixed members
of xlog_op_header in the xlog_recover_process_data.

We can create a crafted image to trigger an out of bounds read by
following these steps:
    1) Mount an image of xfs, and do some file operations to leave records
    2) Before umounting, copy the image for subsequent steps to simulate
       abnormal exit. Because umount will ensure that tail_blk and
       head_blk are the same, which will result in the inability to enter
       xlog_recover_process_data
    3) Write a tool to parse and modify the copied image in step 2

is supposed to decrement the reference count upon expiration. However,
if enqueue_task_dl() is called before the timer expires and cancels it,
the reference count is not decremented, leading to the leak.

USB: core: Fix duplicate endpoint bug by clearing reserved bits in the descriptor

Syzbot has identified a bug in usbcore (see the Closes: tag below)
caused by our assumption that the reserved bits in an endpoint
descriptor's bEndpointAddress field will always be 0.  As a result of
the bug, the endpoint_is_duplicate() routine in config.c (and possibly
other routines as well) may believe that two descriptors are for
distinct endpoints, even though they have the same direction and
endpoint number.  This can lead to confusion, including the bug
identified by syzbot (two descriptors with matching endpoint numbers
and directions, where one was interrupt and the other was bulk).

To fix the bug, we will clear the reserved bits in bEndpointAddress
when we parse the descriptor.  (Note that both the USB-2.0 and USB-3.1
specs say these bits are ""Reserved, reset to zero"".)  This requires us
to make a copy of the descriptor earlier in usb_parse_endpoint() and

CVE-2024-41041	2024-07-29T15:15:12.563	2025-10-09T18:19:49.100	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

udp: Set SOCK_RCU_FREE earlier in udp_lib_get_port().

syzkaller triggered the warning [0] in udp_v4_early_demux().

In udp_v[46]_early_demux() and sk_lookup(), we do not touch the refcount
of the looked-up sk and use sock_pfree() as skb->destructor, so we check
SOCK_RCU_FREE to ensure that the sk is safe to access during the RCU grace
period.

Currently, SOCK_RCU_FREE is flagged for a bound socket after being put
into the hash table.  Moreover, the SOCK_RCU_FREE check is done too early
in udp_v[46]_early_demux() and sk_lookup(), so there could be a small race
window:

We had the same bug in TCP and fixed it in commit 871019b22d1b (""net:

Let's apply the same fix for UDP.

netfilter: nf_tables: prefer nft_chain_validate

nft_chain_validate already performs loop detection because a cycle will
result in a call stack overflow (ctx->level >= NFT_JUMP_STACK_SIZE).

It also follows maps via ->validate callback in nft_lookup, so there
appears no reason to iterate the maps again.

nf_tables_check_loops() and all its helper functions can be removed.
This improves ruleset load time significantly, from 23s down to 12s.

This also fixes a crash bug. Old loop detection code can result in
unbounded recursion:

I can't see any actual reason to attempt to check for this from

bpf: Defer work in bpf_timer_cancel_and_free

Currently, the same case as previous patch (two timer callbacks trying
to cancel each other) can be invoked through bpf_map_update_elem as
well, or more precisely, freeing map elements containing timers. Since
this relies on hrtimer_cancel as well, it is prone to the same deadlock
situation as the previous patch.

It would be sufficient to use hrtimer_try_to_cancel to fix this problem,
as the timer cannot be enqueued after async_cancel_and_free. Once
async_cancel_and_free has been done, the timer must be reinitialized
before it can be armed again. The callback running in parallel trying to
arm the timer will fail, and freeing bpf_hrtimer without waiting is
sufficient (given kfree_rcu), and bpf_timer_cb will return
HRTIMER_NORESTART, preventing the timer from being rearmed again.

However, there exists a UAF scenario where the callback arms the timer
before entering this function, such that if cancellation fails (due to
timer callback invoking this routine, or the target timer callback
running concurrently). In such a case, if the timer expiration is
significantly far in the future, the RCU grace period expiration
happening before it will free the bpf_hrtimer state and along with it
the struct hrtimer, that is enqueued.

Hence, it is clear cancellation needs to occur after
async_cancel_and_free, and yet it cannot be done inline due to deadlock
issues. We thus modify bpf_timer_cancel_and_free to defer work to the
global workqueue, adding a work_struct alongside rcu_head (both used at
_different_ points of time, so can share space).

i40e: Fix XDP program unloading while removing the driver

The commit 6533e558c650 (""i40e: Fix reset path while removing
the driver"") introduced a new PF state ""__I40E_IN_REMOVE"" to block
modifying the XDP program while the driver is being removed.
Unfortunately, such a change is useful only if the "".ndo_bpf()""
callback was called out of the rmmod context because unloading the
existing XDP program is also a part of driver removing procedure.
In other words, from the rmmod context the driver is expected to
unload the XDP program without reporting any errors. Otherwise,
the kernel warning with callstack is printed out to dmesg.

Example failing scenario:
 1. Load the i40e driver.
 2. Load the XDP program.
 3. Unload the i40e driver (using ""rmmod"" command).

This crash happens every time when running sockmap_skb_verdict_shutdown
subtest in sockmap_basic.

This crash is because a NULL pointer is passed to page_address() in the
sk_msg_recvmsg(). Due to the different implementations depending on the
architecture, page_address(NULL) will trigger a panic on Loongarch
platform but not on x86 platform. So this bug was hidden on x86 platform
for a while, but now it is exposed on Loongarch platform. The root cause
is that a zero length skb (skb->len == 0) was put on the queue.

This zero length skb is a TCP FIN packet, which was sent by shutdown(),
invoked in test_sockmap_skb_verdict_shutdown():

	shutdown(p1, SHUT_WR);

In this case, in sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue(), num_sge is zero, and no
page is put to this sge (see sg_set_page in sg_set_page), but this empty
sge is queued into ingress_msg list.

And in sk_msg_recvmsg(), this empty sge is used, and a NULL page is got by
sg_page(sge). Pass this NULL page to copy_page_to_iter(), which passes it
to kmap_local_page() and to page_address(), then kernel panics.

To solve this, we should skip this zero length skb. So in sk_msg_recvmsg(),
if copy is zero, that means it's a zero length skb, skip invoking
copy_page_to_iter(). We are using the EFAULT return triggered by
copy_page_to_iter to check for is_fin in tcp_bpf.c."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

closed until the daemon exits. Therefore read requests waiting for reopen

ibmvnic: Add tx check to prevent skb leak

Below is a summary of how the driver stores a reference to an skb during
transmit:
    tx_buff[free_map[consumer_index]]->skb = new_skb;
    free_map[consumer_index] = IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP;

    tx_buff == [skb=null, skb=<ptr>, skb=<ptr>, skb=null, skb=null]

The driver has checks to ensure that free_map[consumer_index] pointed to
a valid index but there was no check to ensure that this index pointed
to an unused/null skb address. So, if, by some chance, our free_map and
tx_buff lists become out of sync then we were previously risking an
skb memory leak. This could then cause tcp congestion control to stop
sending packets, eventually leading to ETIMEDOUT.

Therefore, add a conditional to ensure that the skb address is null. If
not then warn the user (because this is still a bug that should be
patched) and free the old pointer to prevent memleak/tcp problems."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

btrfs: scrub: handle RST lookup error correctly

[BUG]
When running btrfs/060 with forced RST feature, it would crash the
following ASSERT() inside scrub_read_endio():

	ASSERT(sector_nr < stripe->nr_sectors);

Before that, we would have tree dump from
btrfs_get_raid_extent_offset(), as we failed to find the RST entry for
the range.

[CAUSE]
Inside scrub_submit_extent_sector_read() every time we allocated a new
bbio we immediately called btrfs_map_block() to make sure there was some
RST range covering the scrub target.

But if btrfs_map_block() fails, we immediately call endio for the bbio,
while the bbio is newly allocated, it's completely empty.

Then inside scrub_read_endio(), we go through the bvecs to find
the sector number (as bi_sector is no longer reliable if the bio is
submitted to lower layers).

And since the bio is empty, such bvecs iteration would not find any
sector matching the sector, and return sector_nr == stripe->nr_sectors,
triggering the ASSERT().

[FIX]
Instead of calling btrfs_map_block() after allocating a new bbio, call
btrfs_map_block() first.

Since our only objective of calling btrfs_map_block() is only to update
stripe_len, there is really no need to do that after btrfs_alloc_bio().

This new timing would avoid the problem of handling empty bbio
completely, and in fact fixes a possible race window for the old code,
where if the submission thread is the only owner of the pending_io, the
scrub would never finish (since we didn't decrease the pending_io
counter).

addressed."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Prevent UAF in kvm_spapr_tce_attach_iommu_group()

Al reported a possible use-after-free (UAF) in kvm_spapr_tce_attach_iommu_group().

It looks up `stt` from tablefd, but then continues to use it after doing
fdput() on the returned fd. After the fdput() the tablefd is free to be
closed by another thread. The close calls kvm_spapr_tce_release() and
then release_spapr_tce_table() (via call_rcu()) which frees `stt`.

Although there are calls to rcu_read_lock() in
kvm_spapr_tce_attach_iommu_group() they are not sufficient to prevent
the UAF, because `stt` is used outside the locked regions.

With an artifcial delay after the fdput() and a userspace program which

In the past, there were similar failures reported by CI from other IGT
tests, observed on other platforms.

Before commit 63baf4f3d587 (""drm/i915/gt: Only wait for GPU activity
before unbinding a GGTT fence""), i915_vma_revoke_fence() was waiting for
idleness of vma->active via fence_update().   That commit introduced
vma->fence->active in order for the fence_update() to be able to wait
selectively on that one instead of vma->active since only idleness of
fence registers was needed.  But then, another commit 0d86ee35097a
(""drm/i915/gt: Make fence revocation unequivocal"") replaced the call to
fence_update() in i915_vma_revoke_fence() with only fence_write(), and
also added that GEM_BUG_ON(!i915_active_is_idle(&fence->active)) in front.
No justification was provided on why we might then expect idleness of
vma->fence->active without first waiting on it.

The issue can be potentially caused by a race among revocation of fence
registers on one side and sequential execution of signal callbacks invoked
on completion of a request that was using them on the other, still
processed in parallel to revocation of those fence registers.  Fix it by
waiting for idleness of vma->fence->active in i915_vma_revoke_fence().

I found that ionic_tx_clean() calls napi_consume_skb() which calls
napi_skb_cache_put(), but before that last call is the note
    /* Zero budget indicate non-NAPI context called us, like netpoll */
and
    DEBUG_NET_WARN_ON_ONCE(!in_softirq());

Those are pretty big hints that we're doing it wrong.  We can pass a
context hint down through the calls to let ionic_tx_clean() know what
we're doing so it can call napi_consume_skb() correctly."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

bpf: Fix may_goto with negative offset.

Zac's syzbot crafted a bpf prog that exposed two bugs in may_goto.
The 1st bug is the way may_goto is patched. When offset is negative
it should be patched differently.
The 2nd bug is in the verifier:
when current state may_goto_depth is equal to visited state may_goto_depth
it means there is an actual infinite loop. It's not correct to prune
exploration of the program at this point.
Note, that this check doesn't limit the program to only one may_goto insn,
since 2nd and any further may_goto will increment may_goto_depth only
in the queued state pushed for future exploration. The current state
will have may_goto_depth == 0 regardless of number of may_goto insns
and the verifier has to explore the program until bpf_exit."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

mlxsw: spectrum_buffers: Fix memory corruptions on Spectrum-4 systems

The following two shared buffer operations make use of the Shared Buffer
Status Register (SBSR):

 # devlink sb occupancy snapshot pci/0000:01:00.0
 # devlink sb occupancy clearmax pci/0000:01:00.0

The register has two masks of 256 bits to denote on which ingress /
egress ports the register should operate on. Spectrum-4 has more than
256 ports, so the register was extended by cited commit with a new
'port_page' field.

However, when filling the register's payload, the driver specifies the
ports as absolute numbers and not relative to the first port of the port
page, resulting in memory corruptions [1].

Fix by specifying the ports relative to the first port of the port page.

ocfs2: fix DIO failure due to insufficient transaction credits

The code in ocfs2_dio_end_io_write() estimates number of necessary
transaction credits using ocfs2_calc_extend_credits().  This however does
not take into account that the IO could be arbitrarily large and can
contain arbitrary number of extents.

Extent tree manipulations do often extend the current transaction but not
in all of the cases.  For example if we have only single block extents in
the tree, ocfs2_mark_extent_written() will end up calling
ocfs2_replace_extent_rec() all the time and we will never extend the
current transaction and eventually exhaust all the transaction credits if
the IO contains many single block extents.  Once that happens a
WARN_ON(jbd2_handle_buffer_credits(handle) <= 0) is triggered in
jbd2_journal_dirty_metadata() and subsequently OCFS2 aborts in response to
this error.  This was actually triggered by one of our customers on a
heavily fragmented OCFS2 filesystem.

To fix the issue make sure the transaction always has enough credits for
one extent insert before each call of ocfs2_mark_extent_written().

The warning occurs only if __mem_id_init_hash_table() returns an error. It
returns the error in two cases:

  1. memory allocation fails;
  2. rhashtable_init() fails when some fields of rhashtable_params

The second case cannot happen since there is a static const rhashtable_params
struct with valid fields. So, warning is only triggered when there is a
problem with memory allocation.

Thus, there is no sense in using WARN() to handle this error and it can be
safely removed.

ionic: fix kernel panic due to multi-buffer handling

Currently, the ionic_run_xdp() doesn't handle multi-buffer packets
properly for XDP_TX and XDP_REDIRECT.
When a jumbo frame is received, the ionic_run_xdp() first makes xdp
frame with all necessary pages in the rx descriptor.
And if the action is either XDP_TX or XDP_REDIRECT, it should unmap
dma-mapping and reset page pointer to NULL for all pages, not only the
first page.
But it doesn't for SG pages. So, SG pages unexpectedly will be reused.
It eventually causes kernel panic.

x86: stop playing stack games in profile_pc()

The 'profile_pc()' function is used for timer-based profiling, which
isn't really all that relevant any more to begin with, but it also ends
up making assumptions based on the stack layout that aren't necessarily
valid.

Basically, the code tries to account the time spent in spinlocks to the
caller rather than the spinlock, and while I support that as a concept,
it's not worth the code complexity or the KASAN warnings when no serious
profiling is done using timers anyway these days.

And the code really does depend on stack layout that is only true in the
simplest of cases.  We've lost the comment at some point (I think when
the 32-bit and 64-bit code was unified), but it used to say:

	Assume the lock function has either no stack frame or a copy
	of eflags from PUSHF.

which explains why it just blindly loads a word or two straight off the
stack pointer and then takes a minimal look at the values to just check
if they might be eflags or the return pc:

	Eflags always has bits 22 and up cleared unlike kernel addresses

but that basic stack layout assumption assumes that there isn't any lock
debugging etc going on that would complicate the code and cause a stack
frame.

It causes KASAN unhappiness reported for years by syzkaller [1] and
others [2].

With no real practical reason for this any more, just remove the code.

Just for historical interest, here's some background commits relating to
this code from 2006:

  0cb91a229364 (""i386: Account spinlocks to the caller during profiling for !FP kernels"")
  31679f38d886 (""Simplify profile_pc on x86-64"")

  ef4512882dbe (""x86: time_32/64.c unify profile_pc"")

 “socket” module provides a pure-Python fallback to the 
socket.socketpair() function for platforms that don’t support AF_UNIX, 
such as Windows. This pure-Python implementation uses AF_INET or 
AF_INET6 to create a local connected pair of sockets. The connection 
between the two sockets was not verified before passing the two sockets 
back to the user, which leaves the server socket vulnerable to a 
connection race from a malicious local peer.

Platforms that support AF_UNIX such as Linux and macOS are not affected by this vulnerability. Versions prior to CPython 3.5 are not affected due to the vulnerable API not being included."

Patch series ""mm: Avoid possible overflows in dirty throttling"".

Dirty throttling logic assumes dirty limits in page units fit into
32-bits.  This patch series makes sure this is true (see patch 2/2 for
more details).


This patch (of 2):

This reverts commit 9319b647902cbd5cc884ac08a8a6d54ce111fc78.

The commit is broken in several ways.  Firstly, the removed (u64) cast
from the multiplication will introduce a multiplication overflow on 32-bit
archs if wb_thresh * bg_thresh >= 1<<32 (which is actually common - the
default settings with 4GB of RAM will trigger this).  Secondly, the
div64_u64() is unnecessarily expensive on 32-bit archs.  We have
div64_ul() in case we want to be safe & cheap.  Thirdly, if dirty
thresholds are larger than 1<<32 pages, then dirty balancing is going to
blow up in many other spectacular ways anyway so trying to fix one
possible overflow is just moot."	4.7	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

group is removed from the reclaim list and it is on a relocation work,
it can be added into the unused list in parallel. When that happens,
adding it to the reclaim list will corrupt the list head and trigger
list corruption like below.

There is a similar retry_list code in btrfs_delete_unused_bgs(), but it is
safe, AFAICS. Since the block group was in the unused list, the used bytes
should be 0 when it was added to the unused list. Then, it checks
block_group->{used,reserved,pinned} are still 0 under the
block_group->lock. So, they should be still eligible for the unused list,
not the reclaim list.

The reason it is safe there it's because because we're holding
space_info->groups_sem in write mode.

That means no other task can allocate from the block group, so while we
are at deleted_unused_bgs() it's not possible for other tasks to
allocate and deallocate extents from the block group, so it can't be
added to the unused list or the reclaim list by anyone else.

The bug can be reproduced by btrfs/166 after a few rounds. In practice
this can be hit when relocation cannot find more chunk space and ends
with ENOSPC."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

nilfs2: add missing check for inode numbers on directory entries

Syzbot reported that mounting and unmounting a specific pattern of
corrupted nilfs2 filesystem images causes a use-after-free of metadata
file inodes, which triggers a kernel bug in lru_add_fn().

As Jan Kara pointed out, this is because the link count of a metadata file
gets corrupted to 0, and nilfs_evict_inode(), which is called from iput(),
tries to delete that inode (ifile inode in this case).

The inconsistency occurs because directories containing the inode numbers
of these metadata files that should not be visible in the namespace are
read without checking.

Fix this issue by treating the inode numbers of these internal files as
errors in the sanity check helper when reading directory folios/pages.

Also thanks to Hillf Danton and Matthew Wilcox for their initial mm-layer
analysis."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

nilfs2: fix inode number range checks

Patch series ""nilfs2: fix potential issues related to reserved inodes"".

This series fixes one use-after-free issue reported by syzbot, caused by
nilfs2's internal inode being exposed in the namespace on a corrupted
filesystem, and a couple of flaws that cause problems if the starting
number of non-reserved inodes written in the on-disk super block is
intentionally (or corruptly) changed from its default value.  


This patch (of 3):

In the current implementation of nilfs2, ""nilfs->ns_first_ino"", which
gives the first non-reserved inode number, is read from the superblock,
but its lower limit is not checked.

As a result, if a number that overlaps with the inode number range of
reserved inodes such as the root directory or metadata files is set in the
super block parameter, the inode number test macros (NILFS_MDT_INODE and
NILFS_VALID_INODE) will not function properly.

In addition, these test macros use left bit-shift calculations using with
the inode number as the shift count via the BIT macro, but the result of a
shift calculation that exceeds the bit width of an integer is undefined in
the C specification, so if ""ns_first_ino"" is set to a large value other
than the default value NILFS_USER_INO (=11), the macros may potentially
malfunction depending on the environment.

Fix these issues by checking the lower bound of ""nilfs->ns_first_ino"" and
by preventing bit shifts equal to or greater than the NILFS_USER_INO
constant in the inode number test macros.

Also, change the type of ""ns_first_ino"" from signed integer to unsigned
integer to avoid the need for type casting in comparisons such as the
lower bound check introduced this time."	7.8	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

inet_diag: Initialize pad field in struct inet_diag_req_v2

KMSAN reported uninit-value access in raw_lookup() [1]. Diag for raw
sockets uses the pad field in struct inet_diag_req_v2 for the
underlying protocol. This field corresponds to the sdiag_raw_protocol
field in struct inet_diag_req_raw.

inet_diag_get_exact_compat() converts inet_diag_req to
inet_diag_req_v2, but leaves the pad field uninitialized. So the issue
occurs when raw_lookup() accesses the sdiag_raw_protocol field.

Fix this by initializing the pad field in
inet_diag_get_exact_compat(). Also, do the same fix in
inet_diag_dump_compat() to avoid the similar issue in the future.

And it also pinned it down to commit b5357cb268c4 (""btrfs: qgroup: do not
check qgroup inherit if qgroup is disabled"").

[CAUSE]
That offending commit skips the whole qgroup inherit check if qgroup is
not enabled.

But that also skips the very basic checks like
num_ref_copies/num_excl_copies and the structure size checks.

Meaning if a qgroup enable/disable race is happening at the background,
and we pass a btrfs_qgroup_inherit structure when the qgroup is
disabled, the check would be completely skipped.

Then at the time of transaction commitment, qgroup is re-enabled and
btrfs_qgroup_inherit() is going to use the incorrect structure and
causing the above KASAN error.

[FIX]
Make btrfs_qgroup_check_inherit() only skip the source qgroup checks.
So that even if invalid btrfs_qgroup_inherit structure is passed in, we
can still reject invalid ones no matter if qgroup is enabled or not.

Furthermore we do already have an extra safety inside
btrfs_qgroup_inherit(), which would just ignore invalid qgroup sources,
so even if we only skip the qgroup source check we're still safe."	6.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H

The parameter passed to kfree was 5a5a5a5a, which corresponds to the target field of
the jffs_inode_info structure. It was found that all variables in the jffs_inode_info
structure were 5a5a5a5a, except for the first member sem. It is suspected that these
variables are not initialized because they were set to 5a5a5a5a during memory testing,
which is meant to detect uninitialized memory.The sem variable is initialized in the
function jffs2_i_init_once, while other members are initialized in
the function jffs2_init_inode_info.

The function jffs2_init_inode_info is called after iget_locked,
but in the iget_locked function, the destroy_inode process is triggered,
which releases the inode and consequently, the target member of the inode
is not initialized.In concurrent high pressure scenarios, iget_locked
may enter the destroy_inode branch as described in the code.

Since the destroy_inode functionality of jffs2 only releases the target,
the fix method is to set target to NULL in jffs2_i_init_once."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

nmi_enter()/nmi_exit() touches per cpu variables which can lead to kernel
crash when invoked during real mode interrupt handling (e.g. early HMI/MCE

Early HMI/MCE handlers are called through DEFINE_INTERRUPT_HANDLER_NMI()
wrapper which invokes nmi_enter/nmi_exit calls. We don't see any issue when
percpu allocation is from the embedded first chunk. However with
CONFIG_NEED_PER_CPU_PAGE_FIRST_CHUNK enabled there are chances where percpu
allocation can come from the vmalloc area.

With kernel command line ""percpu_alloc=page"" we can force percpu allocation

lima uses a shared interrupt, so the interrupt handlers must be prepared

disabled early and the interrupts stay registered until the very end of
the remove process due to the devm usage.
This is potentially a bug as the interrupts access device registers

the driver in a kernel with CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ enabled.

so large limits.  For dirty_ratio / dirty_background_ratio it isn't so
simple as the dirty limit is computed from the amount of available memory

VSC is not sent to reset controller during warm reboot.

bnx2x: Fix multiple UBSAN array-index-out-of-bounds

Fix UBSAN warnings that occur when using a system with 32 physical
cpu cores or more, or when the user defines a number of Ethernet
queues greater than or equal to FP_SB_MAX_E1x using the num_queues
module parameter.

Currently there is a read/write out of bounds that occurs on the array
""struct stats_query_entry query"" present inside the ""bnx2x_fw_stats_req""
struct in ""drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnx2x/bnx2x.h"".
Looking at the definition of the ""struct stats_query_entry query"" array:

struct stats_query_entry query[FP_SB_MAX_E1x+
         BNX2X_FIRST_QUEUE_QUERY_IDX];

FP_SB_MAX_E1x is defined as the maximum number of fast path interrupts and
has a value of 16, while BNX2X_FIRST_QUEUE_QUERY_IDX has a value of 3
meaning the array has a total size of 19.
Since accesses to ""struct stats_query_entry query"" are offset-ted by
BNX2X_FIRST_QUEUE_QUERY_IDX, that means that the total number of Ethernet
queues should not exceed FP_SB_MAX_E1x (16). However one of these queues
is reserved for FCOE and thus the number of Ethernet queues should be set
to [FP_SB_MAX_E1x -1] (15) if FCOE is enabled or [FP_SB_MAX_E1x] (16) if
it is not.

This is also described in a comment in the source code in
drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/bnx2x/bnx2x.h just above the Macro definition
of FP_SB_MAX_E1x. Below is the part of this explanation that it important
for this patch

/*
  * The total number of L2 queues, MSIX vectors and HW contexts (CIDs) is
  * control by the number of fast-path status blocks supported by the
  * device (HW/FW). Each fast-path status block (FP-SB) aka non-default
  * status block represents an independent interrupts context that can
  * serve a regular L2 networking queue. However special L2 queues such
  * as the FCoE queue do not require a FP-SB and other components like
  * the CNIC may consume FP-SB reducing the number of possible L2 queues
  *
  * If the maximum number of FP-SB available is X then:
  * a. If CNIC is supported it consumes 1 FP-SB thus the max number of
  *    regular L2 queues is Y=X-1
  * b. In MF mode the actual number of L2 queues is Y= (X-1/MF_factor)
  * c. If the FCoE L2 queue is supported the actual number of L2 queues
  *    is Y+1
  * d. The number of irqs (MSIX vectors) is either Y+1 (one extra for
  *    slow-path interrupts) or Y+2 if CNIC is supported (one additional
  *    FP interrupt context for the CNIC).
  * e. The number of HW context (CID count) is always X or X+1 if FCoE
  *    L2 queue is supported. The cid for the FCoE L2 queue is always X.
  */

However this driver also supports NICs that use the E2 controller which can
handle more queues due to having more FP-SB represented by FP_SB_MAX_E2.
Looking at the commits when the E2 support was added, it was originally
using the E1x parameters: commit f2e0899f0f27 (""bnx2x: Add 57712 support"").
Back then FP_SB_MAX_E2 was set to 16 the same as E1x. However the driver
was later updated to take full advantage of the E2 instead of having it be
limited to the capabilities of the E1x. But as far as we can tell, the
array ""stats_query_entry query"" was still limited to using the FP-SB
available to the E1x cards as part of an oversignt when the driver was
updated to take full advantage of the E2, and now with the driver being
aware of the greater queue size supported by E2 NICs, it causes the UBSAN
warnings seen in the stack traces below.

This patch increases the size of the ""stats_query_entry query"" array by
replacing FP_SB_MAX_E1x with FP_SB_MAX_E2 to be large enough to handle
both types of NICs.

CVE-2024-42149	2024-07-30T08:15:06.543	2024-12-09T23:05:27.663	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs: don't misleadingly warn during thaw operations

The block device may have been frozen before it was claimed by a
filesystem. Concurrently another process might try to mount that
frozen block device and has temporarily claimed the block device for
that purpose causing a concurrent fs_bdev_thaw() to end up here. The
mounter is already about to abort mounting because they still saw an
elevanted bdev->bd_fsfreeze_count so get_bdev_super() will return
NULL in that case.

For example, P1 calls dm_suspend() which calls into bdev_freeze() before
the block device has been claimed by the filesystem. This brings
bdev->bd_fsfreeze_count to 1 and no call into fs_bdev_freeze() is
required.

Now P2 tries to mount that frozen block device. It claims it and checks
bdev->bd_fsfreeze_count. As it's elevated it aborts mounting.

In the meantime P3 called dm_resume(). P3 sees that the block device is
already claimed by a filesystem and calls into fs_bdev_thaw().

P3 takes a passive reference and realizes that the filesystem isn't
ready yet. P3 puts itself to sleep to wait for the filesystem to become
ready.

P2 now puts the last active reference to the filesystem and marks it as
dying. P3 gets woken, sees that the filesystem is dying and
get_bdev_super() fails."	5.5	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

nvmet: fix a possible leak when destroy a ctrl during qp establishment

In nvmet_sq_destroy we capture sq->ctrl early and if it is non-NULL we
know that a ctrl was allocated (in the admin connect request handler)
and we need to release pending AERs, clear ctrl->sqs and sq->ctrl
(for nvme-loop primarily), and drop the final reference on the ctrl.

However, a small window is possible where nvmet_sq_destroy starts (as
a result of the client giving up and disconnecting) concurrently with
the nvme admin connect cmd (which may be in an early stage). But *before*
kill_and_confirm of sq->ref (i.e. the admin connect managed to get an sq
live reference). In this case, sq->ctrl was allocated however after it was
captured in a local variable in nvmet_sq_destroy.
This prevented the final reference drop on the ctrl.

Solve this by re-capturing the sq->ctrl after all inflight request has
completed, where for sure sq->ctrl reference is final, and move forward
based on that.

This issue was observed in an environment with many hosts connecting
multiple ctrls simoutanuosly, creating a delay in allocating a ctrl

calc_available_free_space() returns the total size of metadata (or

First, the calculation of data_chunk_size is wrong. We always allocate
one zone as one chunk, and no partial allocation of a zone. So, we
should use zone_size (= data_sinfo->chunk_size) as it is.

Second, the result ""avail"" may not be zone aligned. Since we always
allocate one zone as one chunk on zoned mode, returning non-zone size
aligned bytes will result in less pressure on the async metadata reclaim

The typescript SDK has no awareness of to-be-spent transactions causing some transactions to fail or silently get pruned as they are funded with already used UTXOs. The problem occurs, because the `fund` function in `fuels-ts/packages/account/src/account.ts` gets the needed ressources statelessly with the function `getResourcesToSpend` without taking into consideration already used UTXOs. This issue will lead to unexpected SDK behaviour, such as a transaction not getting included in the `txpool` / in a block or a previous transaction silently getting removed from the `txpool` and replaced with a new one.	3.1	LOW	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

When a user has view but not edit right on a page in XWiki, that user can delete the page and replace it by a page with new content without having delete right. The previous version of the page is moved into the recycle bin and can be restored from there by an admin. As the user is recorded as deleter, the user would in theory also be able to view the deleted content, but this is not directly possible as rights of the previous version are transferred to the new page and thus the user still doesn't have view right on the page. It therefore doesn't seem to be possible to exploit this to gain any rights. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.21, 15.5.5 and 15.10.6 by cancelling save operations by users when a new document shall be saved despite the document's existing already.	4.3	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
