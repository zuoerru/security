CVE-2017-11129	2017-08-01T14:29:00.313	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for Android. The keystore is locked with a hard-coded password. Therefore, everyone with access to the keystore can read the content out, for example the private key of the user.	7.5	HIGH	AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P		
CVE-2017-11130	2017-08-01T14:29:00.360	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. The product's protocol only tries to ensure confidentiality. In the whole protocol, no integrity or authenticity checks are done. Therefore man-in-the-middle attackers can conduct replay attacks.	6.8	MEDIUM	AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P		
CVE-2017-11131	2017-08-01T14:29:00.390	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. For authentication, the user password is hashed directly with SHA-512 without a salt or another key-derivation mechanism to enable a secure secret for authentication. Moreover, only the first 32 bytes of the hash are used. This allows for easy dictionary and rainbow-table attacks if an attacker has access to the password hash.	4.3	MEDIUM	AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2017-11132	2017-08-01T14:29:00.437	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat before 1.5.18 for Android. No certificate pinning is implemented; therefore the attacker could issue a certificate for the backend and the application would not notice it.	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N		
CVE-2017-11133	2017-08-01T14:29:00.500	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. To encrypt messages, AES in CBC mode is used with a pseudo-random secret. This secret and the IV are generated with math.random() in previous versions and with CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random() in newer versions, which uses math.random() internally. This is not cryptographically strong.	5.0	MEDIUM	AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2017-11134	2017-08-01T14:29:00.530	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for Android. The login credentials are written into a log file on the device. Hence, an attacker with access to the logs can read them.	4.0	MEDIUM	AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2017-11135	2017-08-01T14:29:00.577	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. The logout mechanism does not check for authorization. Therefore, an attacker only needs to know the device ID. This causes a denial of service. This might be interpreted as a vulnerability in customer-controlled software, in the sense that the StashCat client side has no secure way to signal that it is ending a session and that data should be deleted.	5.0	MEDIUM	AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P		
CVE-2017-11136	2017-08-01T14:29:00.610	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. It uses RSA to exchange a secret for symmetric encryption of messages. However, the private RSA key is not only stored on the client but transmitted to the backend, too. Moreover, the key to decrypt the private key is composed of the first 32 bytes of the SHA-512 hash of the user password. But this hash is stored on the backend, too. Therefore, everyone with access to the backend database can read the transmitted secret for symmetric encryption, hence can read the communication.	4.0	MEDIUM	AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N		
CVE-2017-11379	2017-08-01T15:29:00.280	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	Configuration and database backup archives are not signed or validated in Trend Micro Deep Discovery Director 1.1.	5.0	MEDIUM	AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

CVE-2017-11381	2017-08-01T15:29:00.467	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	A command injection vulnerability exists in Trend Micro Deep Discovery Director 1.1 that allows an attacker to restore accounts that can access the pre-configuration console.	7.5	HIGH	AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P		
CVE-2017-12061	2017-08-01T15:29:00.547	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	An XSS issue was discovered in admin/install.php in MantisBT before 1.3.12 and 2.x before 2.5.2. Some variables under user control in the MantisBT installation script are not properly sanitized before being output, allowing remote attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code, as demonstrated by the $f_database, $f_db_username, and $f_admin_username variables. This is mitigated by the fact that the admin/ folder should be deleted after installation, and also prevented by CSP.	6.1	MEDIUM	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N		
CVE-2017-12062	2017-08-01T15:29:00.593	2025-04-20T01:37:25.860	An XSS issue was discovered in manage_user_page.php in MantisBT 2.x before 2.5.2. The 'filter' field is not sanitized before being rendered in the Manage User page, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code if CSP is disabled.	4.3	MEDIUM	AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

User passwords will almost always be default. Installer passwords are expected to be default or similar across installations installed by the same company (but are sometimes changed). Hidden user accounts have (at least in some cases, though more research is required to test this for all hidden user accounts) a fixed password for all devices; it can never be changed by a user. Other vulnerabilities exist that allow an attacker to get the passwords of these hidden user accounts.

This in turn meant that the same Processor could be used for concurrent requests. Sharing a Processor can result in information leakage between requests including, not not limited to, session ID and the response body. The bug was first noticed in 8.5.x onwards where it appears the refactoring of the Connector code for 8.5.x onwards made it more likely that the bug was observed. Initially it was thought that the 8.5.x refactoring introduced the bug but further investigation has shown that the bug is present in all currently supported Tomcat versions.	5.0	MEDIUM	AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N
